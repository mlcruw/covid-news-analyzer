35@6@Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window.
37@6@The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage.
48@6@The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so.
59@6@Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost."
62@6@The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered about in its anguish; a faint and mournful "Tweet, tweet," was all it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and its heart broke for want and longing.
63@6@The flower could not, as on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped sorrowfully.
64@6@The boys only came the next morning; when they saw the dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and adorned it with flowers.

51@6@As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest.
59@3@How the fir-tree trembled!
71@4@It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them.

7@6@He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.
19@4@The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.
29@4@One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.
38@4@The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.
56@3@Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty.
80@6@Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.
82@6@Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.
91@4@A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.
93@6@He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.
98@4@So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.
111@4@They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.

77@7@All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.
78@3@Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.
98@2@Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.
99@2@There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.

63@4@The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.
64@4@The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.
98@4@So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better.
107@6@Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.
112@6@Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor.
147@4@These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart.

54@6@If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.
66@4@Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.
99@6@And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.
108@4@One stanza pleased him exceedingly-
126@2@Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love.
137@6@Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.
162@6@How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!
181@6@There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself.

11@4@Its parents kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible, "On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son."
19@6@He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all.
28@4@His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her.
47@6@A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.

99@4@Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."
121@4@The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.
129@4@"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."

7@2@Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts.
8@2@When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up.
11@3@The cook, however, thought to himself: "If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble."

18@2@So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: "Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life."
20@2@The cook once more said: "If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life."
43@4@Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast.
47@6@Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king"s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished.

57@4@The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.
