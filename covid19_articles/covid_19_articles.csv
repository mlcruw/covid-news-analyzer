['Bret Baier’],2020-04-15,Sources believe coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan lab as part of China's efforts to compete with US,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.

EXCLUSIVE: There is increasing confidence that the COVID-19 outbreak likely originated in a Wuhan laboratory, though not as a bioweapon but as part of China's attempt to demonstrate that its efforts to identify and combat viruses are equal to or greater than the capabilities of the United States, multiple sources who have been briefed on the details of early actions by China's government and seen relevant materials tell Fox News.

This may be the ""costliest government cover-up of all time,"" one of the sources said.

The sources believe the initial transmission of the virus – a naturally occurring strain that was being studied there – was bat-to-human and that ""patient zero"" worked at the laboratory, then went into the population in Wuhan.

The “increasing confidence” comes from classified and open-source documents and evidence, the sources said. Fox News has requested to see the evidence directly. Sources emphasized -- as is often the case with intelligence -- that it’s not definitive and should not be characterized as such. Some inside the administration and the intelligence and epidemiological communities are more skeptical, and the investigation is continuing.

What all of the sources agree about is the extensive cover-up of data and information about COVID-19 orchestrated by the Chinese government.

Asked by Fox News' John Roberts about the reporting, President Trump remarked at Wednesday's coronavirus press briefing, ""More and more we're hearing the story...we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation.""

Documents detail early efforts by doctors at the lab and early efforts at containment. The Wuhan wet market initially identified as a possible point of origin never sold bats, and the sources tell Fox News that blaming the wet market was an effort by China to deflect blame from the laboratory, along with the country's propaganda efforts targeting the U.S. and Italy.

U.S. Embassy officials warned in January 2018 about inadequate safety at the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab and passed on information about scientists conducting risky research on coronavirus from bats, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Responding to the report, Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Tuesday afternoon: ""It should be no surprise to you that we have taken a keen interest in that and we've had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that. I would just say at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural, but we don't know for certain.""

“Even today, I see them withholding information and I think we need to do more to continue to press them to share,” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told “America’s Newsroom"" on Wednesday, referring to China. Esper added that he wouldn't speak to ""intelligence reporting,"" but that ""most people believe it began naturally — it was organic, if you will. I think in due course, once we get through the pandemic we're in right now, there'll be time to look back and really ascertain what happened and make sure we have a better understanding so we can prevent this in the future.""

Sources point to the structure of the virus, in saying the genome mapping specifically shows it was not genetically altered.

Speaking to ""The Story"" Wednesday evening, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo remarked: ""What we do know is we know that this virus originated in Wuhan, China. We know there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was. There is still lots to learn. You should know that the United States government is working diligently to figure it out.""

Concerning the State Department cables warning about the Wuhan laboratory, Pompeo said the installation ""contained highly contagious materials — we knew that, we knew that they were working on this program, many countries have programs like this. In countries that are open and transparent, they have the ability to control them and keep them safe, and they allow outside observers in to make sure all the processes and procedures are right. I only wish that that had happened in this place.""

On Thursday, China's foreign ministry pushed back on the suspicion that the virus escaped from the facility, by citing statements from the World Health Organization that there is no evidence the coronavirus came from a laboratory.

Americans were originally helping train the Chinese in a program called PREVENT well before the Chinese started working on this virus. The French government helped the Chinese set up the Wuhan lab.

China ""100 percent"" suppressed data and changed data, the sources tell Fox News. Samples were destroyed, contaminated areas scrubbed, some early reports erased, and academic articles stifled.

STATE DEPT LEAKED CABLES RENEW THEORIES ON ORIGINS OF CORONAVIRUS

There were doctors and journalists who were ""disappeared"" warning of the spread of the virus and its contagious nature and human to human transmission. China moved quickly to shut down travel domestically from Wuhan to the rest of China, but did not stop international flights from Wuhan.

Additionally, the sources tell Fox News the World Health Organization (WHO) was complicit from the beginning in helping China cover its tracks.

Trump announced at the White House coronavirus news briefing in the Rose Garden on Tuesday that the United States will immediately halt all funding for the WHO, saying it had put ""political correctness over lifesaving measures."" The United States is the WHO's largest single donor, and the State Department had previously planned to provide the agency $893 million in the current two-year funding period.

Senior administrations separately tell Fox News the rollout of the president’s “blueprint for reopening the U.S. economy” will happen Thursday afternoon, first for governors and then briefed to the press.

Meanwhile, Trump's own handling of the crisis has come into focus. On January 24, for example, Trump tweeted in praise of China’s “transparency"" on coronavirus.

Though they were not speaking for the president, the sources ventured an explanation, saying it was diplomatic talk to make the Chinese ""feel good"" while the investigation was ongoing, with trade and other talks happening simultaneously.

In the six days after top Chinese officials secretly determined they likely were facing a pandemic from a new coronavirus, the city of Wuhan at the epicenter of the disease hosted a mass banquet for tens of thousands of people; millions began traveling through for Lunar New Year celebrations.

TRUMP CUTS ALL WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION FUNDING

President Xi Jinping warned the public on the seventh day, Jan. 20. But by that time, more than 3,000 people had been infected during almost a week of public silence, according to internal documents obtained by The Associated Press and expert estimates based on retrospective infection data.

“This is tremendous,” said Zuo-Feng Zhang, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “If they took action six days earlier, there would have been much fewer patients and medical facilities would have been sufficient. We might have avoided the collapse of Wuhan’s medical system.”

A protest of more than 200 demonstrators broke out in Southern California on Friday against the state’s stay-at-home-orders in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak, according to reports.

The action in Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles, was similar to others staged this week in Michigan, Ohio and other locations as Americans seek a return to a more normal life after more than a month of mitigation measures intended to slow the spread of the virus, also known as COVID-19.

As in the other locations, demonstrators in Huntington Beach alleged that state-government-imposed restrictions, intended as safeguards, were becoming an infringement on their personal freedoms.

BRET BAIER SAYS 'MORE AND MORE DOTS' POINT TO WUHAN LAB AS ORIGIN OF CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

Placards held by protesters Friday held messages such as “Defy Fascist Lockdown,” “Stop the Tyranny, Open California,” and “We Deem Our Governor Non Essential.”

“I don’t think there’s any reason for us to be on lockdown now,” Paula Doyle, 62, of Costa Mesa told the Los Angeles Times. “We didn’t have any dangers. We have no danger in our hospitals now of overflowing.”

“I don’t think there’s any reason for us to be on lockdown now. We didn’t have any dangers. We have no danger in our hospitals now of overflowing.” — Paula Doyle, 62, Costa Mesa resident

Earlier in the week, three Southern California churches filed a lawsuit against Gov. Gavin Newsom, accusing the Democrat of “criminalizing church attendance” with orders limiting social gatherings.

Newsom, 52, a former mayor of San Francisco who became governor in January 2019, issued his stay-at-home order March 19, becoming one of the first governors to do so. The move has been credited with helping the nation’s most populous state keep its infection and fatality numbers relatively low considering its population of some 39.5 million people.

He said Tuesday he foresees a loosening of the state’s stay-at-home orders but did not provide a specific date.

The governor said at a news conference that the public’s adherence to his orders had “bent the curve” on the number of infections in the state, suggesting the limits could end in the near future.

“The models have changed because of your behavior,” Newsom said. “This will not be a permanent state.”

But protesters in Huntington Beach – and oceanfront city of about 200,000 residents – expressed frustration with the governor’s limits during Friday’s demonstration.

“It’s not dangerous out here. It’s not,” Benny White, 33, of Compton, told the L.A. Times. “I’ve seen plenty of people out here. The beaches are open. It’s a nice, beautiful day. What are we doing? Stop being a germophobe.”

The protest was organized largely via social media and began around 1 p.m. local time, the Orange County Register reported. Police asked the crowd to break up around 3:30 p.m., the report said.

As of late Friday, California had more than 29,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and had recorded just over 1,000 deaths.

['David Aaro'],2020-01-31,Trump says US working closely with China on coronavirus,"President Trump said in an exclusive interview with Fox News late Thursday that his administration is working closely with China during the deadly coronavirus outbreak and said the U.S. was in ""great shape"" thus far in dealing with the illness.

Speaking before he took the stage at his rally in Des Moines, Trump said he was ""dealing very closely with China."" He added the White House would make a statement ""in the next 24 hours and 48 hours.""

The announcement was made as his impeachment trial continued on Thursday. Trump was asked how concerned he was about the deadly virus, which the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled a global health emergency earlier in the day.

STATE DEPARTMENT, CITING CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, RAISES CHINA TRAVEL ADVISORY: 'DO NOT TRAVEL'

""We are in great shape. China is not in great shape right now, unfortunately. But they’re working very hard,"" Trump said. ""We’ll see what happens. But we’re working very closely with China and other countries.""

Trump appointed a task force to coordinate the U.S. response to the virus, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said, according to Bloomberg.

HOW ARE US HOSPITALS PREPARING FOR CORONAVIRUS?

It will reportedly be led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, with other members including Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.

“The task force will lead the administration’s efforts to monitor, contain, and mitigate the spread of the virus, while ensuring that the American people have the most accurate and up-to-date health and travel information,” Grisham said, according to the outlet.

['Manny Alvarez’],2020-01-31,What you should know about the coronavirus outbreak and how you should prepare,"For the last two weeks, the whole world has been monitoring and keeping tabs on the coronavirus outbreak that started in China.

Every day, we see the contagion growing and thousands of people in China are infected. Today, we see the announcement that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is declaring a national emergency. However, the president's Coronavirus Task Force has emphasized that the American public is at low risk. Even though the strain is new, this virus is similar to those seen in other outbreaks, such as the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. Yet, it is a deadly virus and there are still many unknowns as so far as the behavior of the disease.

Incubation symptoms usually take from 7 to 14 days and because of the nature of this virus, it is very contagious in human-to-human transmission. I have been asked how worried Americans should be. I believe that rather than worried, we must be proactive and educated.

I am very confident in President Trump’s task force because its membership is composed of brilliant scientists and epidemiologists, as well as leaders of government health care divisions. There are also many scientific companies already working on a vaccine.

CORONAVIRUS DECLARED PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN THE US

The most important question is: How do Americans get prepared? I have a few suggestions that I want to share.

We already know about travel bans where this epidemic is growing – so don’t travel to China. We also know that there is going to be monitoring and possible quarantines of patients who have recently arrived from that region.

However, we must also focus on our health. When you look at ways that many people have died from coronavirus, most of those cases have been from pulmonary complications. Most patients die from complications of pneumonia. When you get massive pneumonia from a viral infection, you have severe inflammation of lung tissue, which interferes with oxygenation and ultimately compromises other organs such as your heart, kidneys and liver. In other words, a septic shock develops.

Many times, pneumonia from viral infections also leads to a bacterial infection. This complicates the ability of your body to fight back and makes it difficult for your physicians to treat your infection.

UNITED AIRLINES CANCELS ALL FLIGHTS TO MAINLAND CHINA AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK

So, here's what we should all think about:

First, most viral pneumonia outbreaks occur in people who are older or very young, i.e. infants. It also occurs in people with chronic diseases such as COPD, cardiac problems, congestive heart failure, Type 2 Diabetes, renal disease, and patients undergoing cancer treatment. Also, individuals with immunodeficiency disorders.

There are, however, some things that we can do to protect ourselves:

If you smoke, now is a good time to stop smoking.

If you are overweight, now is a good time to lose weight.

If you are non-compliant with taking your meds, i.e. blood pressure medication, it is a good time to keep this under control.

If you have Type 2 Diabetes be sure to be compliant with taking your medications and/or insulin.

A balanced diet helps.

Vaccines are important.

Pneumococcal Vaccine

The pneumococcal vaccine is strongly recommended for older folks. Vaccines literally work like armies in your body to fight the infections that could make problems if you develop pneumonia. People over Age 65 should talk to their physician about getting the pneumococcal vaccine.

Flu Vaccine .

This is not a vaccine to think about. The flu vaccine is important for everyone as early as 6 months old. Please get it!

TDAP Vaccine

The famous whooping cough is a problematic disease. This vaccine gives your body the proper antibodies to fight secondary infections that you might get from viral pneumonia.

The rationale for all the vaccines that I have mentioned is not that they will directly prevent you from getting the coronavirus, but they can prevent you from getting secondary complications. Getting the proper vaccines improves the ability of your body to fight and that is why it is important for you to consider them.

This is a good time not to worry, but to think about your health. This is a good time to stop the procrastination and have that conversation with your doctor. This is a good time to see how your own health is important and follow up on the recommendations of the doctors that have been advising us all to do the right thing.",foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/health/what-you-should-know-about-the-coronavirus-outbreak,0,0,HAPPY,WELLNESS
['Jennifer Griffin'],2020-03-30,Army researchers at Fort Detrick who helped discover Ebola treatment seek coronavirus vaccine,"Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.

FORT DETRICK, Md. -- Army researchers at Fort Detrick are fast at work growing batches of COVID-19 to help test treatment options and eventually find a coronavirus vaccine.

""They take some of the virus and put it onto cells,"" Dr. Kathleen Gibson, a core laboratory services division chief at the U.S. Army's Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases [USAMRIID], explained through a triple-glass window as Army researchers wearing protective gear worked with the deadly virus. ""They look for the virus that will actually kill portions of the cells and they'll count those killed portions.""

These are the same army scientists who helped develop vaccines for anthrax, the plague and Ebola. Now, they have been working double shifts growing large amounts of the COVID-19 virus at this sprawling lab complex.

""We have more capacity to run more studies at the same time,"" Col. E. Darrin Cox, the commander of USAMRIID, explained. ""We can be running things in parallel rather than having to do things sequentially, and that's helped speed up the process of the science.""

Fort Detrick has one of the country's few labs with biosafety level 4-specialized equipment, allowing researchers to work on the most deadly viruses.

It's taken two weeks to grow a lot of COVID-19. Fort Detrick received its first vial of the virus from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] a month ago. Its scientists have started the genetic sequencing of the virus, using machines capable of fast, large-scale drug testing as well.

""We have a large capacity to be able to test a very large number of products. Most other places don't have that infrastructure to be able to develop or test as many products at a time,"" according to Dr. John Dye, the USAMRIID viral immunology chief. ""There are at least eight different companies that are developing vaccines that all can be assessed looking for safety in humans... Having multiple shots on goal is our best chance of being able to basically battle this virus.""

Army researchers have shot compounds such as chloroquine into vials of COVID-19 to see how it's reacted.

""We can test about 300 drugs or compounds in each plate,"" Dr. Sheli Radoshitzky said. ""We add the compounds using this robotic system and then we transfer the plates into bio-containment where we add the virus.""

Since 1969, this warren of Army research labs known as USAMRIID has served as the Defense Department’s lead laboratory for medical biological defense research.

It has worked with biotech firms such as Gilead to discover drugs including Remdesivir -- an antiviral to fight Ebola -- which may work on COVID-19. USAMRIID has worked with the CDC, National Institutes of Health [NIH] and private drug companies to bring these drugs to market.

This past December, a vaccine for Ebola produced in conjunction with Merck received its license, a key step in Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approval. It was several years in the making, but these Army labs found the key particle that led to the discovery.

CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Men and women in these hallways were some of the first boots on the ground during the first Ebola outbreak.

The Army scientists working with COVID-19 have used level 3 gear because the virus is less lethal than Ebola, but still highly contagious.

A biosafety officer showed Fox News an airlock where scientists have decontaminated after working their shifts. These high-pressure chemical showers acted like a car wash, with scientists showering in their protective gear.

These level 4 labs at Fort Detrick have shifted to COVID-19 research, doubling their ability to find therapeutic drugs and, eventually, a vaccine.

""The anthrax vaccine... we've helped develop. There's also plague vaccines that we've developed here, as well as the vaccines and treatments for Ebola virus. So, there's been a long history, at least 50 years here of research and development all the way from the benchtop to a final clinical product,"" Dye explained.

They have used sneeze labs -- a technology the U.S. Army invented -- to test how the virus has spread through the air.

""It would mimic you and I walking through someone's sneeze. There's a swirl of virus within droplets, so it doesn't exist just in air, but it's in fine droplets of many different sizes,” Maj. Sabrina McGraw, a scientist in the Center for Aerobiology at USAMRIID, explained. ""Large droplets would land on your mouth and eyes, maybe on your hands, on surfaces, small droplets. You breathe them into your nostrils. Some of them make it past your projections, get deep into the lungs.""

A vaccine may take 18 months. These researchers have been moving quickly to animal trials using known therapeutics. Tests using ferrets may eventually hold the key to curing coronavirus in people, according to Cox.

""The smaller animals, the ferret is actually a good model. And so, the ACE 2 inhibitor gene that ferrets possess is similar to that in humans,"" Cox said. ""One thing that's going on right now is active determination of the appropriate animal models to further study COVID-19.""

Asked what his message to Americans would be after seeing these Army scientists at work, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said, ""These men and women have been here before and they prevailed… We're going to find this vaccine and we're gonna win in the end.""",foxnews,https://www.foxnews.com/health/army-ebola-treatment-coronavirus-vaccine-sought,0,2,HAPPY,SCIENCE
['Javier C. Hernández'],2020-01-18,Deadly Mystery Virus Reported in 2 New Chinese Cities and South Korea,"Still, the commission acknowledged that the source of the virus and its path of transmission were not fully understood.

“The mutation of the virus still needs to be closely monitored,” the statement said.

Of the new patients found in Wuhan over the weekend, 66 were men and 70 women, and their ages ranged from 25 to 89, the health commission reported on Monday. It said that they mostly had symptoms such as fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.

Most people with the infection have contracted it through exposure to animals at a market in Wuhan that sells seafood and live animals, the authorities say. But the health commission in Wuhan said on Sunday that some people who had come down with the virus had no exposure to the market.

That acknowledgment raises the possibility that the virus could be present in other markets in Wuhan, experts said, adding to fears that more people might be at risk.

“If you cannot find the source and control the source of the virus, you cannot extinguish the fire,” said David Hui, the director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Dr. Hui said the risk of the virus spreading from human to human on a broad scale appeared to be low, though he noted that the virus could mutate.

The World Health Organization said on Sunday that while its analysis indicated that limited transmission of the virus is possible, it remained unclear whether it can easily spread from one person to another.

"['Sui-Lee Wee', 'Donald G. Mcneil Jr.']",2020-01-08,China Identifies New Virus Causing Pneumonialike Illness,"Many questions about the new virus remain. While it appears to be transmitted to humans via animals, the Chinese government has not said which animals, nor has it disclosed other details about the outbreak, like the transmission route, the incubation period or the ages and genders of the patients.

“So, there are still a lot of question marks,” said David Hui, an expert in emerging infections at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

The authorities in Wuhan are still closely monitoring 163 people who were in close contact with the patients, Dr. Hui said. He added that 15 days, the minimum incubation period for some viral infections, had not yet passed since the last reported instance of the disease, on Dec. 29.

“It’s premature to say that there’s no human-to-human transmission,” Dr. Hui said.

The Wuhan government confirmed on Dec. 31 that the health authorities were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause. Symptoms of the new illness include high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions, according to the Wuhan health commission. Seven people have become critically ill, the Wuhan authorities have said. On Wednesday, the local health commission said eight people had been discharged.

Researchers have been encouraged by the fact that patients’ relatives and hospital workers have not been reported to have gotten sick, signaling that the virus may not spread easily among humans.

“We can assume that this virus transmissibility is not that high,” said Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, who was part of a team that successfully identified the coronavirus that caused SARS.

Dr. Guan said he was not surprised that the virus identified was a coronavirus, because coronaviruses can pass from animals to humans easily. But he said it would probably be a while before researchers came up with treatments for the illness.",nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/health/china-pneumonia-outbreak-virus.html,0,1,Surprised,SCIENCE
['Sui-Lee Wee'],2020-02-09,"As Deaths Mount, China Tries to Speed Up Coronavirus Testing","The government’s decision to modify the protocol, unusual in its swiftness, underscored the pressure it is under, particularly in Hubei’s capital, Wuhan, a city of 11 million where pleas from residents desperate for medical help have caused widespread public anger. The vast majority of deaths in China from the coronavirus have been recorded in Wuhan.

Dr. Joe Chang, a specialist at the department of radiation oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said the use of CT scans to screen patients in Hubei made sense.

“The issue now is the number of patients,” he said. “No country can be prepared for these kinds of numbers.”

In Wuhan, long lines of people snake around the city’s hospitals, and many residents with fevers, coughs and other symptoms of the virus say they can’t get tested.

Yuan Xiuhua, a 49-year-old Wuhan resident, came down with a fever on Jan. 22 and went to a hospital, where CT scans showed lesions in her lungs. She has repeatedly asked her community district, which prioritizes who gets tested for the coronavirus, to give her one, but was told that because there were too many possible cases, she was better off isolating herself at home. Her husband, she said, recently came down with a fever and diarrhea.

Ms. Yuan said she was still calling her community district every day to ask for a test.

“They keep on saying that there are no free spots,” she said. “They didn’t provide me with any help. They’ve just made me wait.”

Faced with criticism over the slow response in the first weeks of the outbreak, Beijing has ordered increasingly extreme measures.

He had been using an oxygen machine to support his breathing for 30 minutes in the morning and again at night. Now he couldn’t breathe at all, and needed to be hooked up to the machine around the clock. He came down with a high fever. For four days he was so uncomfortable that he couldn’t sleep, Ms. Zhang said.

Desperate to find help, Ms. Zhang and her family called everyone they could think of. But the hospitals were all full. Emergency responders told them they needed to secure a hospital bed first before an ambulance could be sent.

Ms. Zhang was devastated to see her grandfather, who had helped raise her, nearing death. Overnight, her social media feed, normally full of food and travel photos, became a flood of urgent cries for help. In a last-ditch effort, she called a hotline for the city’s mayor. But an operator had no answers, and asked her what they planned to do.

“You’re asking me, an ordinary citizen, how to resolve this?” she replied. She hung up.

That afternoon, her grandfather died in the family’s apartment.

Workers from a funeral home arrived to take his body away. They said that because he had possibly been infected with the virus, the family was not allowed to accompany the body and it had to be cremated immediately.

But they had no time to mourn. Ms. Zhang’s grandmother was now deteriorating rapidly. They took her to a hospital, where a doctor said that her lungs appeared on a CT scan as almost entirely white — signs of severe pneumonia.

['Neil Irwin'],2020-03-09,Why the Outlook for the Economy Just Got Worse,"The Federal Reserve is likely to take further actions to contain the damage for the economy and financial markets. Not only do futures markets indicate the Fed will cut its short-term interest rate target more in the coming weeks, but the yield on 10-year United States Treasury bonds also fell to a mere 0.54 percent, and the 30-year bond now yields only 1 percent. Those numbers strongly suggest investors expect the Fed to keep rates near zero — or conceivably below zero at some point — for a very long time.

The oil price rout — a barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude was at $31.13, down 25 percent in a single day and around half its level at the start of the year — implies trouble to come in the American oil patch.

Cheaper oil will create benefits for American consumers and for oil-consuming industries. But as the shale gas industry has grown and the United States has become a net energy exporter, the balance has changed in how cheaper energy affects the economy.

The pain of cheap oil will tend to be highly concentrated in oil-producing locations, and will have an outsize impact on capital spending. (Spending on energy is a major driver of demand for heavy industrial equipment.) A telling indicator: Shares of Halliburton, the leading maker of energy equipment, were down 38 percent Monday, compared with about 7 percent for the overall market.

The United States has experienced something like this before, in late 2015 and early 2016, when a drop in commodity prices caused an economic slump that was most pronounced in the oil patch and in heavy industry.

In that episode, the overall United States economy kept humming along because consumer spending and service industries were mostly unaffected. What makes the outlook for 2020 seem so different is that the oil price swoon is coming at the same time coronavirus appears likely to wallop those sectors.

The damage is still highly uncertain. But if large gatherings like conferences and concerts continue to be canceled, and more people decide they will not fly this summer and stay home more generally, it’s likely to cripple the consumer-driven side of the economy.",nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/upshot/coronavirus-oil-prices-bond-yields-recession.html,0,4,Fearful,BUSINESS
['Chris Cillizza’],2020-04-15,Kellyanne Conway's simply false spin on 'Covid-19',"(CNN) No one can spin like Kellyanne Conway. It's the secret to how she has lasted so long as senior counselor to President Donald Trump, someone who puts a premium on his advisers' ability to take lemons and turn them into lemonade. Or at least tell people they turned them into lemonade.

But Conway's sangfroid for spin occasionally gets her into trouble. Wednesday morning was one of those times. In an appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" Conway was asked about Trump's decision Tuesday to revoke US funding for the World Health Organization. Here's what she said (bolding is mine):

""The President took decisive and immediate action at the end of January to shut down flights to China. That was criticized by the WHO. It was criticized by other people as xenophobic and racist and travel bans don't work. Well, this one sure did. We have every right to know. And every right to know because what's happened here in this global pandemic. But there's another reason, some of the scientists and doctors say that there could be other strains later on. This could come back in the fall in a limited way. This is Covid-19, not Covid-1, folks. You would think that people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that. This is just a pause right now. So there is an investigation, examination to what happened. But people should know the facts.""

The message Conway is trying to spin here is clear: The WHO had 18 previous chances to tell the world about Covid-19 -- and didn't do a good job of it. Man, they must really stink! Or, are they, maybe, hiding things from America?!?!!?

['Maeve Reston'],2020-04-19,Trump: 'Testing is a local thing',"(CNN) Amid rising tensions with governors , President Donald Trump touted the number of coronavirus tests being conducted in the United States, insisting that the federal government is helping states get needed supplies and announcing that he is invoking the Defense Production Act to help with producing nasal swabs, a critical component for testing.

""Our testing is expanding very rapidly by millions and millions of people,"" Trump claimed Sunday night during the coronavirus task force briefing. It was unclear why the President cited that number since the US is only testing about 150,000 people daily.

A day after he lashed out at governors , the President said he was working very well with governors and played clips of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, praising aspects of the federal response. At the same time, Trump continued to contend that the federal government cannot be responsible for testing in each community.

""The governors wanted to have total control over the opening of their states. But now they want to have us, the federal government, do the testing,"" Trump said.

""Testing is local. You can't have it both ways. Testing is a local thing. It's very important. It's great. But it's a local thing. And we are going to get it done to a level in a very short period of time. All the swabs are coming in, all the necessary materials. A lot of them are already there, but a lot of people don't know that yet.""

Addressing some of the concerns from governors in recent days about the lack of supplies needed to conduct the tests, he held up one of the nasal swabs that is being used in some tests and compared it to a Q-tip, while acknowledging that it is a more complex tool.

Last week, Trump said the administration is sending out more than 5 million nasal swabs, but he said Sunday some states ""don't know where they are."" The President said he is using the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of swabs, a critical component of the tests that has been in short supply in many states across the country.

""The swabs -- that's easy,"" Trump continued. ""We have them coming in by the tens of millions."" He said the nation will end up with so many swabs ""you won't know what to do with them.""

The administration is finalizing a deal with a company that is converting its plant to produce 10 million swabs per month and is using his powers under the Defense Production Act to force another company to match that production so the nation will have access to 20 million additional swabs per month.

Two people familiar with the decision told CNN that company is Puritan Medical Products, which is based in Maine. It is known for making ""flocked swabs,"" which it says are better at collecting specimens than others.

Trump said the administration had experienced ""difficulty"" with the company, but did not elaborate further. Puritan did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

Relationship with governors

Trump announced that Vice President Mike Pence will call the nation's governors Monday after several days of tension over who should be responsible for obtaining the critical components needed to conduct coronavirus tests, including nasal swabs, the viral transport medium need to carry the specimens and chemical reagent, which is used to help determine the diagnosis.

Pence plans to make the call from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's headquarters to discuss coronavirus testing and ""develop locally tailored testing strategies.""

On Saturday, he lashed out at governors for ""complaining,"" asserting that they were politicizing the testing issue in the same fashion as when they were calling for ventilators in recent weeks.

But even some Republican governors are disputing that notion, stating that it will be impossible to reopen private businesses -- as Trump wants to do by early May -- without expansive testing to know who is healthy and who is not.

On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said the lack of testing is the number one problem in America and ""has been since the beginning of the crisis.""

""The administration, I think, is trying to ramp up testing. They are doing some things with respect to private labs,"" Hogan told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""But to try and push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing -- somehow we aren't doing our job -- is just absolutely false.""

On NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, also a Republican, said he could probably double or even triple testing virtually overnight ""if the FDA would prioritize companies that are putting a slightly different formula together for the extraction reagent kit.""

""We have a shortage, worldwide shortage, of some of the materials that go into this,"" DeWine told NBC's Chuck Todd. ""So, we really need help -- if anybody in the FDA is watching, this would really take our, take our capacity up, literally Chuck, overnight.""

Cuomo warned on Sunday that if New York were to open businesses too quickly, the cases would accelerate again instead of that number going down.

""We apex, we plateaued, it's coming down the other side. That is good news,"" Cuomo said Sunday. ""So we exhale, we can control the beast -- yes -- but the beast is still alive. We did not kill the beast. And the beast can rise up again.""

Even when some businesses are allowed to reopen at an undetermined date in the future, he said state officials will be closely monitoring the infection and hospitalization rates.

If the infection begins to spread again, ""you can go right back to where you were in one week's time,"" Cuomo said. ""And if we went through all of this and lost all of these people and forced essential workers and hospital workers to do unbelievable tasks to get us through this crisis -- and we recreate the crisis, then shame on us.""

A self-congratulatory briefing

On a day when the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States surpassed 40,000 people and after the number of people who have filed for unemployment hit 22 million , Trump defended his decision to play self-congratulatory clips during the briefing.

Asked by CNN's Jeremy Diamond whether it was the right time to tout the his response given the high number of deaths and the hardships that many jobless Americans are facing, Trump said he was merely ""standing up for the men and women who have done such an incredible job.""

""I'm sticking up for those people. I am also sticking up for the doctors and nurses and military doctors and nurses,"" he said. The President also made the baseless claim that ""those people have been excoriated by the fake news.""

""It's not about me. Nothing is about me. You are never going to treat me fairly, many of you, and I understand that,"" Trump said, berating reporters.

But just a few minutes earlier, Trump had, in fact, made the briefing about his leadership since the beginning of the pandemic.

Suggesting that other countries decided to ""wing it"" during the early onset of the coronavirus, Trump once again touted his decision on ""banning people coming in from China"" and later from parts of Europe, even though his order only applied to nationals from those countries and did not include, for example, Americans living or traveling in China.

""We would have had millions of deaths instead of -- it looks like we'll be at about the 60,000 mark, which is 40,000 less than the lowest number thought of,"" he said.

Trump went on to praise Democratic governors who have complimented parts of the federal response, including Cuomo, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. He then played the clip of Cuomo describing how the President sent in the Army Corps of Engineers to build 2,500 beds at the Javits Center in New York.

""These were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilization, and the federal government stepped up and was a great partner,"" Cuomo said in the clip from his Sunday briefing.

""It was really a very nice thing that he said and people appreciate that,"" Trump said after complaining that his staff had not included a last clip that he wanted to play in the montage.

""I believe that the terms the governor used was phenomenal. 'You've done a phenomenal job—that was the term, that was the only sentence they left out (of the clips played during the briefing), which is okay, but I appreciate that that's what Gov. Cuomo said,"" Trump continued.

Small business package negotiations

Trump said Sunday he was optimistic about the ongoing negotiations between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Democratic congressional leaders to provide billions of additional dollars to small businesses to continue the Payroll Protection Program.

""We are very close to a deal. I can't tell you whether we're going to get the deal or not,"" Trump said. ""We want to take care of our workers we want to take care of our small companies.""

""We are also looking at helping our hospitals and our rural hospitals who have been hurt very badly,"" he said. ""The rural hospitals for a long time have not been treated properly. We are looking to help them and beyond.""",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/19/politics/trump-briefing-sunday-april-19/index.html,0,4,Surprised,POLITICS

US national security adviser Robert O’Brien said the novel coronavirus could have negative consequences for the US-China trade deal, but it won’t fundamentally change the agreement.

“This could have an impact on the phase one deal,” O’Brien said Tuesday evening.

“It’s not going to change the phase one deal,” he continued. “It’s just we expect that part of the phase one deal China will spend more money on US agricultural products, and we’ll have to see how that plays out.”

Virus conspiracy theory: O'Brien also admitted that it’s not clear where the virus came from, and would not flatly deny theories that it may have originated as a biological weapon, as Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has suggested.

“I’ve seen those reports, and Twitter and the internet are alive with them,” he said. “I don’t have any information on that one way or the other.""

['Agence France-Presse'],2020-01-28,China coronavirus: German man infected by colleague who had travelled to Wuhan,"A German man who tested positive for the strain of coronavirus currently sweeping China was infected by a work colleague, officials said on Tuesday, in what is believed to be the first human transmission in Europe.
The man had not visited China but a Chinese work colleague who was in Germany last week had “started to feel sick on the flight home on January 23”, said Andreas Zapf, head of the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety.
He had attended a training session given by his Chinese colleague on January 21 at the office of a car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf in Bavaria and tested positive for the virus on Monday evening.
Unlike the other patients, the 33-year-old had not recently travelled to China.

He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he “was doing well”.


The Chinese woman immediately sought medical attention on her return to China and was confirmed to have caught the virus, which has spread rapidly in recent weeks after first emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

The woman had recently returned from visiting her parents in the Wuhan region, Zapf said.

In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China “for at least the next two weeks”.

Health officials are checking some 40 people that the two infected workers have been in contact with recently, including colleagues and family members.

The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has so far killed 106 people and infected over 4,000 -- the bulk of them in and around Wuhan. Cases have also been reported in a string of other countries, including the United States, France, Australia and Japan.

France was the first European country to be affected by the outbreak, which has reported three known cases of the virus. All three had recently travelled to China and have been placed in isolation.

Germany has recommended its citizens avoid “unnecessary” trips to China as the virus spreads.
The country is also considering the possible evacuation of its nationals from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.
China has tried to curb new infections by cordoning off entire cities right in the midst of the Lunar New Year, when millions of people normally travel to take holidays and visit family in other parts of the vast country.

Beijing has also extended the Lunar New Year holiday until Sunday in a bid to limit the movement of people.
The real number of infected in China could be much higher. Gabriel Leung, head of the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said on Monday that his team’s research indicated that there were likely around 44,000 cases at the incubation stage.
Most of those who died from lung disease after catching the virus were elderly or had pre-existing conditions.

Cases of the coronavirus have also been reported in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Nepal, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United States, France and Australia.
Many countries in Europe and Asia are planning to repatriate their citizens from Wuhan. Japan, the United States and France have already begun repatriation operations.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses ranging from a common cold to more severe disease like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars).

['Agence France-Presse'],2020-01-24,China coronavirus: US investigating second suspected case,"Authorities in Texas are investigating a second suspected case on US soil of a deadly Chinese virus, namely a college student who had recently returned from the city at the heart of the outbreak, officials said on Thursday.
Brazos County, just northwest of Houston, “is investigating a suspected case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)”, its health authority wrote in a statement on Facebook.
“The patient travelled from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated,” it added.
The patient’s age is somewhere between 20 and 30 and they returned to the United States, where they are attending Texas A&M University, days before health screenings began at airports on January 15, local health official Eric Wilke told reporters.

“The person presented to an area emergency department yesterday mostly out of concern, not out of symptoms,” said Wilke, adding that they were now being kept isolated at home while testing was performed, with the result likely to arrive over the next day or two.


The patient had “mild upper respiratory symptoms” including cough and congestion and appeared to be improving. Such symptoms are common in the middle of winter flu season, but the patient was being screened further on the basis of their travel history.
A blood sample has been sent to the headquarters of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, which should arrive late Thursday or early Friday, with a result expected within 24 hours after that.

If the case is confirmed, the patient would be the second person to be infected with the pathogen on US soil after a man in his 30s near Seattle reported himself to authorities on January 19. That man, a US resident who also recently travelled to Wuhan, is said to be recovering well and is due to be released from hospital soon.

CDC officials had already warned that there would be more cases in the US given the frequency of international travel.

All air traffic from Wuhan is currently being funnelled through five airports where health officials have been deployed to carry out screening with questionnaires and temperature checks.

The new respiratory virus has claimed 18 lives since emerging from a seafood and animal market in Wuhan and infected hundreds more.

China has locked down some 20 million people at the epicentre of the outbreak, but the World Health Organisation said Thursday the disease did not yet constitute a global health emergency.
But it has generated alarm because of its similarity to Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.",scmp,https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3047462/china-coronavirus-us-investigating-second-suspected,0,2,Fearful,WELLNESS
['Orange Wang'],2020-03-13,China’s inbound foreign direct investment plunges in February as coronavirus disrupts economy,"Foreign direct investment into China shrank by a quarter last month from a year earlier amid an outbreak of coronavirus, the Ministry of Commerce said on Friday, underscoring the tough job facing Beijing to woo overseas investment in its slowing economy.
Investment into China fell 25.6 per cent in February in yuan terms from a year ago, after increasing 4 per cent in January, Zong Changqing, head of the ministry’s foreign investment department, said at a press conference in Beijing.
“It will be an extremely challenging job to stabilise foreign investment this year,” he said.
The drop in FDI last month is not surprising as manufacturing and service activities in China came to a halt in February as the government imposed draconian controls to contain the spread of the virus.
Beijing fears the impact of the coronavirus, which has disrupted global supply chains in the car and electronics industries, could accelerate the exodus of manufacturing from China as companies seek to avoid over-reliance on one country.


Chinese President Xi Jinping last month urged officials to pay particular attention to helping the China-based operations of foreign companies, which play an important part in global value chains. Local governments across China are rushing to help big-name investors such as Tesla and big exporters such as Foxconn overcome the effects of the pandemic.

Premier Li Keqiang, the No. 2 official in the Chinese leadership, wrote to Starbucks congratulating the company for recently signing off on a new investment deal in China. The Seattle-based company decided to spend US$130 million to build a coffee roasting factory in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, with the location now officially known as “Starbucks China Coffee Innovation Park”.
“China’s market potential is huge and its long-term sound economic trend remains, and China will continue to be a hot destination for foreign investment,” said Li’s letter, which was published on the Chinese government’s website.

China is struggling to maintain its position in global value chains. Rising costs and increasingly unfriendly business environment are causing many potential investors to drag their feet.

The UN Conference on Trade and Development said in a report earlier this week that the coronavirus outbreak will cause global FDI to shrink by between 5 per cent and 15 per cent from previous forecasts and may fall to the lowest level since the financial crisis in 2008.

['Matt Ho'],2020-04-15,"China’s initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan spread twice as fast as we thought, new study suggests","The new coronavirus could have been twice as contagious as previously thought when it spread from its initial epicentre in central China, a fresh look at the early stages of the outbreak has suggested.
Epidemiologists had previously estimated that each person with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, infected two to three people on average, based on early cases in the city of Wuhan.
But researchers in the United States have said that the chaos in Wuhan as infections there rose at the start of the year may have produced incomplete data and a distorted picture.
The new estimation by Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico is that those who carried the coronavirus in Wuhan were passing it on to 5.7 people on average.


The finding could help public health experts to refine their containment and vaccination strategies.
In their study, published last week in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, the researchers, led by Steven Sanche and Lin Yen-ting, wrote: “Unavailability of diagnostic reagents early in the outbreak, changes in surveillance intensity and case definitions, and overwhelmed health care systems confound estimates of the growth of the outbreak based on data.”

The Los Alamos research analysed about 140 early patients outside Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, to project how intensely the coronavirus was spreading from the epicentre. Most of the initial cases in other provinces had epidemiological links or exposure to Wuhan.

“By the time cases were confirmed in provinces outside Hubei, all of the provinces of China had access to diagnostic kits and were engaging in active surveillance of travellers out of Wuhan,” the researchers said.

“The health care systems outside Hubei were not yet overwhelmed with cases and were actively searching for [their] first positive case, leading to much lower bias in the reporting.”

Many provinces’ health commission or local Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would also release basic epidemiological information on how each patient could have been related to another, or where they had shared exposure.

The US researchers also used mobile phone data to estimate the numbers of daily travellers in and out of Wuhan.

Their projection was then compared back with the death rate pattern in Wuhan, which was more clearly defined and consistent than the city’s other data on the outbreak.
They found that instead of taking six to seven days for the number of infected people to double, as was previously thought, it took only 2.3 to 3.3 days to do so.

Based on their newly estimated intensity of the initial outbreak, the research team said that achieving so-called herd immunity would need at least 82 per cent of people to be immune (by infection or vaccination) to stop the contagion spreading in a population – not about 60 per cent, as previous research suggested.

In late January, researchers from mainland China and Hong Kong, including China CDC chief George Gao, had estimated that a Covid-19 patient could infect an average of 2.2 people, based on studying 425 patients in Wuhan.

A more recent estimate of this reproduction number, by Imperial College London last month, found the figure for 11 European countries including Britain to be 3.87 people.
Also last month, research at Payame Noor University in Tehran, which was subject to peer review, found that an average of 4.86 people could be infected per patient in the first week of the outbreak in Iran.
The reproduction number for the 2002-03 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak – which infected over 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, mostly in mainland China and Hong Kong – was estimated by the World Health Organisation to be 3.
The authors of the new Los Alamos study added that a higher level of infectiousness meant that if asymptomatic carriers accounted for a substantial proportion of transmission, then quarantine and tracing of contacts of those showing symptoms would not be enough to halt the virus’ spread.
“When 20 per cent of transmission is driven by unidentified infected persons, high levels of social distancing efforts will be needed to contain the virus,” they said.
“The decline in newly confirmed cases in [mainland] China and South Korea in March 2020 and the stably low incidences in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, strongly suggest that the spread of the virus can be contained with early and appropriate measures.”
Plunges in official and private sector purchasing managers’ indices amid the coronavirus outbreak have prompted sharp revisions of China’s economic forecasts for 2020, with the odds now rising that China will report a sharp deceleration in growth – or even a contraction – in the first quarter.

“The coronavirus epidemic has obviously impacted China’s economy. It is necessary to pay attention to the divergence of business sentiment between the manufacturing and the service sectors,” added Zhong.

“While recent supportive policies for manufacturing, small businesses and industries heavily affected by the epidemic have had a more obvious effect on the manufacturing sector, it is more difficult for service companies to make up their cash flow losses.”",scmp,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3079879/chinas-initial-coronavirus-outbreak-wuhan-spread-twice-fast-we,0,4,Surprised,SCIENCE
['Finbarr Bermingham'],2020-03-31,"Coronavirus: China’s March PMI steadies, but economy not out of the woods yet","China's economy showed signs of a recovery in March after a nationwide lockdown paralysed business in February, but analysts warned that it is not yet out of the woods.
Despite stronger-than-expected government data released on Tuesday, a series of threats lying ahead could derail China’s fragile recovery, including a second wave of infections, a global recession, worsening deflation due to plunging oil prices and a potentially sharp fall in the property market.
“While the lowest point is behind us, it’s not the time to celebrate,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Bank.
For now, March’s figures suggest that business conditions are improving considerably, as more people are able to return to work and coronavirus cases continue to fall.
The official purchasing managers’ index (PMIs) surveys showed that both the manufacturing and services sectors returned to growth in March, with many factories and retailers reopening as mainland authorities got the pandemic under control.


It will be welcome news for Beijing after a series of economic data plunged to all-time lows in January and February – including February’s PMIs, which are viewed as leading indicators of the state of the economy for the month ahead.

The manufacturing PMI, a survey of sentiment among factory owners, bounced back to 52.0 in March from 35.7 in February, which was an all-time low by some distance.

China’s non-manufacturing PMI – including both the services and construction sectors – was even weaker in February at 29.6, but its recovery to 52.3 was more marked.

A number above 50 signifies growth in sector activity, while a number below indicates contraction.

Both indices were significantly higher than expected and produced the V-shaped recovery in sentiment that policymakers had been so desperately pursuing.

But analysts warned that this may be short-lived as virus containment measures are set to sap demand across the globe, hitting China’s exports hard.
This was perhaps reflected in the fact that while many key components of the PMIs returned to growth in March, new export orders remained negative at 46.4.

“We would like to emphasise that the 52 reading [for manufacturing PMI] actually means a weak business resumption,” said Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura.

“We view the jump in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs in March as one-off gains from the very low comparison bases in February.”
The dramatic collapse of the economy in the second month of the year meant March’s economic data was always likely to show a positive spike, with PMIs highly sensitive to short-term fluctuations in business conditions due to the way they are collated. Researchers simply ask respondents if things are better or worse than they were the previous month.
“This does not mean output is now back to its pre-virus trend,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note. “Instead, it simply suggests that economic activity improved modestly relative to February’s dismal showing, but remains well below pre-virus levels. This is consistent with what the daily activity indicators show.”

Officials in Beijing have been vocal in recent days about their concerns of a possible second economic shock wave. At a press conference in the capital on Monday, vice-minister of industry and information technology Xin Guobin said that small businesses and exporters might “struggle to survive” in the months ahead, due to global economic turbulence.
That was reflected in a new study by investment firm Fidelity International that showed while more than half of restaurants in China have reopened, daily turnover was 40 to 50 per cent below levels seen before the outbreak. Hotel occupancy figures, meanwhile, remain in single digits.
“Expect further slack in quarters three and four, which means the authorities will have to postpone their target to double gross domestic product growth levels to the first half of 2021,” said Carlos Casanova, Asia-Pacific economist at insurer Coface.",scmp,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3077760/coronavirus-chinas-march-pmi-steadies-economy-not-out-woods,0,3,Fearful,BUSINESS
