['Bukola Adebayo'],2020-04-30,"WHO investigating reported increase in deaths in Kano, Nigeria, governor says","Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) The World Health Organization and health officials in the northern Nigerian state of Kano have launched a probe into reports of increases in unusual deaths, state Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje told CNN.

A team of experts is gathering hospital records and interviewing families of those who died at home to determine the actual cause of death.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has also ordered a 14-day lockdown in Kano following the reported spike in deaths.

Buhari said the government will deploy all ""human, material and technical"" assistance to contain the coronavirus in the state, and a team has been sent to investigate.

Preliminary investigations by the state ministry of health suggest that the increase in mortality was not unusual compared to other years, Ganduje said.

Still, officials are interviewing cemetery workers, checking hospital records and asking residents about family members who died at home, the governor said.

State officials had earlier said the ""mysterious deaths"" were not Covid-related and attributed the deaths to meningitis, diabetes, hypertension, and other illnesses, even though no autopsies have not been done.

Kano isn't the only place to see an increase in deaths.

A Yale School of Public Health team, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, found about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19.

A spike in deaths

A gravedigger, Kabiru Nasidi Sabon-Sara, who has worked at the Dandolo Cemetery in Kano city for over 30 years, told CNN funerals carried out at the graveyard have doubled.

Sabon-Sara said he began noticing the spike in deaths a day before Ramadan, and numbers have continued to rise since state authorities imposed a lockdown to curb a spread of the virus.

""In Dandolo we get between 35 to 40 burials, and it used to be less than that, between 13 to 15 at most in a day,"" Sabon-Sara said.

He said one of the diggers who joined a funeral procession died, and some other diggers have been ill.

""We don't have anything to protect ourselves. Our colleagues are falling sick. We need assistance from the government,"" Sabon-Sara told CNN.

Health workers faced a challenge in determining whether the deaths were coronavirus-related: the state's testing laboratory was not working at the time, Ganduje said. That made it difficult for health workers to collect samples for testing.

Older patients affected

Dr. Abubabar Nagoma, president of the Kano association of resident doctors who works at the government-owned Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, said there has been a rise in deaths among elderly patients in the state in recent weeks.

He said while some had underlying illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and previous strokes, they also had respiratory problems -- increasing concerns that they might have been coronavirus-related deaths.

""We're raising the high index of suspicion because of the age of some of the patients that died and the symptoms they experienced,"" Nagoma told CNN.

""We can't say the deaths are unconnected to the pandemic, and we can't say for sure it's Covid-19.""

Dr. Nura Abubakar of Kano's Medical Association said the lack of data about the situation during a pandemic has sparked speculation. Only a thorough probe could help put an end to it, Abubakar said.

""I know a woman who had breast cancer that died over the weekend,"" Abubakar said. ""We can say she succumbed to the illness, and we can't say she died of Covid-19 because she was not tested for the virus.""

Looming epidemic

The NCDC announced Tuesday that it had reopened the lab and planned to set up another testing center, but the delay and news of people dying had sparked concerns that the virus was spreading undetected in the state.

The unconfirmed ""mysterious deaths"" have caused some apprehension among residents who are demanding answers, Maulid Warfa, head of the UNICEF office in Kano told CNN.

Warfa said Kano had been battling other public health concerns, including high infant and maternal death rates, before the pandemic and it lacked the capacity to carry out enough tests to give a true picture of the situation.

""Kano only got its first laboratory about two weeks ago, and immediately that testing started, the numbers started jumping,"" he said.",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/africa/who-probe-nigeria-deaths/index.html

Nonessential businesses in Accra and Kumasi, the country's two largest cities, can re-open Monday and residents can return to work but must continue to practice social distancing, he said.

In a televised address on Sunday, Akufo-Addo said the decision did not mean the government was letting its guard down, saying existing bans on public gatherings and school closure were still in place.

He urged Ghanaians to wear masks when going outside and to continue adhering to social distancing measures in public places.

Ghana has confirmed 1,042 cases, and nine people have died, according to Ghana's Disease Surveillance Department on Monday.

The bank estimates ""Covid-19 will cost the region between $37 billion and $79 billion in output losses for 2020 due to a combination of effects,"" including trade disruption and reduced remittances, tourism and foreign aid.

While most countries in the region will see a decline in growth, ""real gross domestic product growth is projected to fall sharply particularly in the region's three largest economies -- Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa -- as a result of persistently weak growth and investment,"" the report said.

The bank also warned of a potential food security crisis in Africa as a result of disrupted agricultural production and food imports.

While several African countries swiftly implemented measures to curb the spread of the outbreak, the report identified ""several factors that pose challenges to the containment and mitigation measures, in particular the large and densely populated urban informal settlements, poor access to safe water and sanitation facilities, and fragile health systems.""

"['David Mckenzie', 'Brent Swails']",2020-04-29,South Africa's painful past HIV failures is helping the country to fight Covid-19,"Thokoza, South Africa (CNN) When President Donald Trump mused recently about injecting household disinfectants as treatment for Covid-19 in the White House briefing room, South Africans were reminded of their own dark past.

Two decades ago, the country's health minister announced that beetroot or garlic could treat HIV/AIDS.

In all, South Africa's official AIDS denials and misinformation cost the lives of more than 300,000 people, according to several studies.

""We can't have a large number of people dying,"" Dr. Yogan Pillay, a senior official at the Department of Health, said. ""We came from a period where we had large numbers of South Africans dying from HIV. We can't repeat that now and we shouldn't.""

An ambitious initiative

It is the memory of that past failure, South African health officials say, that is driving their fight against this new virus and it is the considerable resources they have since built up against HIV, that could provide their best weapon in fighting Covid-19.

After years of dithering under Mbeki, the South African government drastically changed course against HIV because of civil society lawsuits and a change in leadership.

They put millions of people on ARVs and recruited an army of community health workers to inform the public of the dangers of AIDS and the importance of testing.

They were able to mount this fight, in large part, because of an ambitious initiative launched by another US Republican president.

Former President George W. Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), announced in 2003, is arguably the single most successful international US public health response.

More than 14 million people are on ARVs because of PEPFAR. When it began, fewer than 50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa could access the life-sustaining drugs.

""Quite frankly, without the PEPFAR investment in South Africa, we wouldn't have more than a million people on treatment, a significant reduction in the number of deaths from HIV and TB, or the significant increase in our life expectancy,"" Dr. Pillay said.

Pillay said that there are currently roughly eight million HIV positive people in South Africa, with more than two million infected people not on antiretrovirals.

A sweeping lockdown

Those numbers mean that South Africa has the world's largest HIV burden, which helped to convince South African scientists and officials to recommend a sweeping lockdown as Covid-19 struck the country.

Countries around the world are under lockdown, but South Africa's is one of the strictest and it was instituted before a single confirmed Covid-19 death and in a country already in an economic recession.

""This was a very tough decision for the government to take,"" Dr. Pillay said, ""but they took it because they didn't want to repeat the mistakes of ... our early response to HIV.""

In a middle-income country with the world's greatest levels of inequality , South Africa has managed to drastically flatten its infection curve early while much richer countries like the UK and the United States have struggled to do so.

South Africa has distinct disadvantages to those wealthy nations. Millions live in townships and informal settlements across the country where the lockdowns make sense in principle, but not really in practice.

Townships like Thokoza, in the southeast of Johannesburg, are a nightmare scenario for combating a respiratory disease.

But here, too, the country's experience with HIV is helping its battle.

Thousands of health workers are targeting townships and informal settlements throughout South Africa.

Around 35,000 government and PEPFAR supported health workers are now actively screening for the disease in communities they already work, conducting routine health checks, according to Pillay.

They have already screened nearly six million people for Covid-19, according to the latest figures from the country's Department of Health.

Community health worker Anito Pato said that the trust she has built up with the community allows her to address fear of the new virus right away. She goes door-to-door in Thokoza to check for symptoms of Covid-19 and refer the sick for testing.

""They didn't know much about Covid-19 and they think it is affecting the rich people, not them,"" Pato said. ""We try to explain to them why we are screening and what corona is.""

Anita Pato has been working as a community health worker for more than 10 years.

A man in a blue work shirt called Pato over during her visit. He wanted a test. Pato explained that there aren't enough tests right now and that he should go to the clinic or the mobile testing center they have set up if he gets the symptoms.

""AIDS is better because we have got treatment,"" the man, Salvin Tawananda, told CNN, ""But corona, people are just scared.""

The government and US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are closely monitoring efforts in Thokoza and other townships, where social distancing is all but impossible, and failure could be disastrous.

""It is very hard for people here to adhere to those lockdown rules and that is even more reason why we should be out there looking for the disease before it takes over these communities,"" said Dr. Meredith McMorrow, a CDC official based in South Africa.

""South Africa was certainly the hardest hit by HIV and it concerns us that it will be the hardest hit by Covid-19 as well that is why we are doing everything we can to get ready right now.""

Covid-19's effect on HIV patients

McMorrow's concern comes from not yet knowing Covid-19's effects on HIV positive people.

To date, studies in China and elsewhere are inconclusive, but Megan Doherty, the head of the WHO's global HIV program, said it pays to be extremely cautious with any emerging disease.

""Because this is an unprecedented pandemic, we just don't know how it reacts in all situations,"" she said. ""We just don't know enough about the interactions between HIV and Covid-19 and how patients with both infections will do.""

ARVs are being tested as possible therapeutics for COVID-19 in clinical trials.

Dr. Larry Corey, now president and director emeritus of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, helped develop the first effective ARV treatment.

He said he is skeptical that ARVs designed for HIV will become a broad-based treatment for Covid-19.

""The best ARVs that are discovered are highly specific to each virus,"" he said.

Corey, who now leads the global HIV-vaccine trial network, said regardless of the results of ARV trials in Covid-19 treatment, South Africa is well placed to play a critical part in the next phase of this pandemic, because of its HIV infrastructure and experience with HIV vaccine trials.

""I feel proud of my communities,"" said Pato, as she moved down a narrow path leading to another section of corrugated iron shacks. ""I feel like I am a bullet to shoot this disease. It must not control us. We must control this corona.""",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/africa/south-africa-hiv-coronavirus/index.html
['Bukola Adebayo'],2020-04-10,Africa's leaders forced to confront healthcare systems they neglected for years,"(CNN) Africa's ailing presidents and powerful elites have been known to jet out to seek treatment abroad, instead of investing in healthcare in their own countries.

Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari was out of the country for several months in 2017 for treatment in London for an undisclosed illness and has frequent checks abroad. Since he took office in 2015, he has embarked on at least four medical trips to the UK.

But with flights grounded and countries across the world on lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, these leaders are getting a wake-up call that they must fix their healthcare systems.

The President of the Commonwealth Medical Association , Osahon Enabulele, says while citizens have endured their leaders' frequent recourse to overseas medical treatment in the past, they may not remain so tolerantif the coronavirus wreaks havoc as it has elsewhere in the world.

""There is no place for any leader to hide anymore,"" Enabulele said. ""This whole situation of public office holders in Africa, most times using taxpayers' money to go on foreign medical trips at the slightest discomfort is one thing that will be reversed when this pandemic is over,"" Enabulele told CNN.

A terrifying prospect

across the continent, while significantly lower than other parts of the world, are rising exponentially. The Infection numbersacross the continent, while significantly lower than other parts of the world, are rising exponentially. The World Health Organization recently reported that the number of cases in Africa was now more than 11,000, with 600 deaths.

The pandemic has overwhelmed advanced health facilities, and experts predict it could devastate the continent's fragile health systems, already plagued by inadequate funding and labor disputes.

Lifesaving machines like ventilators -- critical to the management of Covid-19 cases -- remain a luxury in some African countries.

The Central African Republic (CAR) has only three ventilators to five million people, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said, warning that an outbreak could bring the tiny African nation to its knees.

""When rich nations are in panic mode stating that thousands of ventilators will not be enough, it just brings to light how poorer nations like CAR don't stand a chance in the fight against Covid-19,"" NRC Country Director in the CAR, David Manan said.

The situation is equally dire in Zimbabwe, where health workers in the nation's hospitals say they lack basics such as bandages and gloves to take care of their patients.

Nurses and doctors abstained from work to protest a shortage of coronavirus protective gear after the country recorded its first fatality last month.

Ugandan popstar-turned-politician Bobi Wine told CNN the healthcare system in many African countries cannot handle a mass outbreak of Covid-19.

""I need to remind people that the coronavirus is more serious than they are already taking it. It is killing people in big numbers in Italy where there is a super health care system. So it scares me to even imagine what it can do in Africa if it comes in full effect,"" Wine said.

Wine said health care funding has not been at the forefront of government spending in many African countries because their leaders often seek treatment in hospitals abroad.

""It's clear that healthcare is not a priority for many African governments, and they put very little money into that sector. Anytime they are sick, or their children are having health conditions, they opt to go outside their countries,"" Wine said.

""Now the coronavirus pandemic has set a different ground for many African leaders. It has shown that they should have invested in the healthcare system of their countries which would have benefited them and the people in this crisis.""

The lawmaker says monies spent on medical trips abroad could have been used to equip local hospitals with modern medical equipment such as ventilators, which have proved critical in treating some patients who have developed respiratory illnesses because of Covid-19.

Wine said some public hospitals in Uganda had become ""death traps"" due to years of neglect, and some citizens, including himself, have had to pay prohibitive costs for overseas treatment that could have been cheaper in Uganda.

Between 2019 and 2020, Uganda spent 8.9 percent of its national budget on health down from 9.2 percent from the previous fiscal year, according to UNICEF.

""I have had to spend my funds to seek advance treatment abroad because the procedure could not be provided in this country. But a majority of leaders in Uganda travel abroad for minor care using taxpayers money,"" Wine said.

But Uganda's health minister Jane Aceng told CNN Wine's assessment of the country's health system was not accurate.

""Uganda is doing well and that shows with our response to the coronavirus situation. We're doing well,"" she said.

Aceng added that she had all the resources needed to do her job.

The East African nation was one of the first African countries to impose travel and strict quarantine policies to prevent the spread of coronavirus even before it reported a case. It has so far reported 53 cases

A failed pledge

African leaders have consistently neglected their country's health sector despite several pledges to do improve it, analysts say.

In 2001, the heads of state of 52 African countries met in Nigeria's capital, Abuja and committed to spending 15 percent of their yearly domestic budget on health.

Just a handful of countries have met this target on the continent. They include Tanzania , Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia, according to the WHO.

Rwanda doubled it's health care spending over a period of 10 years, the WHO said in the 2017 report. The Central African nation has also received praised for its national health insurance coverage which is the highest on the continent

But a majority have fallen through the cracks in fulfilling this commitment.

Since it signed the declaration, Nigeria has allocated less than six percent of its budget to health, and most of the funds are spent on salaries, according to Nigeria-based budget monitoring organization Budgit

In a paper published by the Brookings Institute , researchers said although Africa bore 23 percent of the world's disease burden in 2015, it accounted for only one percent of the global health spending for the same year.

""In per capita terms, the rest of the world spends 10 times more on health care than Africa,"" the researchers said.

The researchers predict it may be difficult for the countries on the continent to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with a 2030 deadline with the ""current spending environment.""

Wake-up call

Nigerian-British historian Ed Keazor agrees that the fallout from the outbreak is a ""wake-up call"" for governments to prioritize affordable health care.

Keazor, a cancer survivor said he made the difficult decision to move back to London where he has access to affordable care under the National Health Service even though he works in Nigeria.

The filmmaker said he came to Lagos for a research and film festival in March but got caught in the city after the Nigerian government banned all international flights to contain the spread of the outbreak.

Keazor says he's missed an appointment with his doctor in the UK due to the travel restriction, and that would not have been a problem if he could get the same quality of care locally.

""If I could get the same quality of care here (Nigeria) as in the UK where I'm a taxpayer and getting good medical services, I would rather stay back here because this is where my work and my larger family is but unfortunately, its not there,"" Keazor told CNN.

For now, he hopes the health crisis will change the Nigerian government's focus to where he says it should be.

""I hope the enormity of this problem has brought home the urgency of investment in health care infrastructure to the government and whatever the country looks like after this crisis is over, our priorities will be focused on heath care and education,"" he said.",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/africa/african-leaders-healthcare-coronavirus-intl/index.html

['Aisha Salaudeen'],2020-04-17,Nigerian tailors are hand-making PPE to help fight coronavirus,"(CNN) As the world experiences a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic , tailors in Nigeria are responding by hand-making equipment like overalls and face masks.

Rising demand, panic buying, hoarding, and misuse have disrupted the global supply of PPE, according to the World Health Organization , putting lives at risk.

Now, tailors in Abia state, in the southeast of the country, are using local fabrics, cotton, and polypropylene to sew PPE for people looking to protect themselves.

With cases of Covid-19 rising in Nigeria , the Abia state government released a 12 million naira (about $31,000) grant to support tailors to make the protective gear.

The grant was disbursed to 100 selected tailors at the start of April to help them buy additional equipment, source materials and employ more people, according to Sam Hart, the director-general of the Abia State Marketing and Quality Management Agency.

Hart explained that the initial face mask samples were examined by a team of medical experts and that the gear is intended for citizens looking for protection, rather than for health workers.

The tailors sew different varieties of overalls and facemasks. Photo: Sam Hart

Local solution

So far, tailors in Aba, the state's commercial nerve center, have produced 200,000 face masks and 3,000 overalls, the agency said.

One of the tailors, Queen Duruibe, told CNN that the overalls she makes are waterproof and puncture-resistant, and are made from a polyamide fabric coated with protective materials.

Her face masks are made with cotton and polypropylene and are hypoallergenic, she said. She also produces decorative face masks made from a colorful print fabric, which aren't intended to protect from coronavirus.

Duruibe had been producing face masks since January but says she has now taken on more staff and converted her fashion store to make up to 10,000 masks per day.

Queen Duruibe runs her own fashion store in Aba.

""I sew different types of clothes here in Aba and I usually buy my materials from China,"" she said. ""But when coronavirus happened, they (her suppliers) started telling me how bad things are, that there are no materials and face masks are scarce.

""So I thought to myself that if things are so scarce, I can actually start producing them myself.""

Finding buyers

The equipment produced by the tailors is sold for around 200 naira (roughly 50 cents), according to Hart, and it is finding a range of buyers.

""We had a pharmacist who bought 10,000 pieces to stock in his pharmacy for sale,"" he said. ""The PPE overalls and face masks have been made available to the public -- anybody can order. We even have some Nigerians in the diaspora who have made bulk orders for their communities and villages here in Abia.""

Tailors say the overalls they make are water and puncture proof.

The state government has also ordered masks, which it will distribute to the most vulnerable citizens, according to John Okiyi, the state commissioner for communications.

""65,000 of these facemasks have already been distributed in some local governments through churches and mosques,"" he told CNN. ""The government has also ordered the production of an additional 150,000 face masks for further distribution.""

He added that the state government has distributed N95 face masks to health workers, because those are more suited to medical professionals.

Beating coronavirus

Abia currently has no confirmed cases of coronavirus, but there have been more than 400 cases in Nigeria. The country has put in place travel restrictions to control the spread of the virus, and all international airports and land borders have been closed

Three of Nigeria's 36 states -- Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja -- have imposed an extended lockdown that began on March 30. Abia state is also on a self-imposed lockdown.

['Zaina Adamu'],2020-04-08,"Ghana's lavish funerals can last up to seven days. Now, a centuries-old tradition has gone online","Accra, Ghana (CNN) Funerals are a big deal in Ghana and it is not uncommon, in some parts, for a ceremony to last up to seven days, drawing thousands of crowds adorned in flowing red and black robes and gold jewelry.

Some families even hire professional mourners to cry at the funeral of their loved one because ""it serves as a reward to the person who has died,"" says Adwoa Yeboah Agyei, who owns The Funeral Shop and Services, a franchise with locations across Accra.

Ghanaian funerals are heavily symbolic and rituals involved include giving offerings to the spirits of the ancestors and loud traditional dancing and drumming to accompany the dead on their journey.

Anguished families

But a centuries-old tradition has come to a halt.

Since Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo suspended all public gatherings in mid-March in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, burials have been limited to no more than 25 people in the West African nation.

Obed Ampadu-Asiamah's 73-year-old father, Daniel, passed away soon after the announcement following complications from a stroke.

Obed has been scrambling to make painful phone calls send notices informing attendees he could only invite 25 family members and friends. They originally expected 2,000 people and an official funeral has been postponed to a later date.

""We had to cut all the in-laws and the grandchildren. None were able to attend,"" he told CNN, his voice shaking.

""We could only provide six slots for members on my father's side of the family and three for members of his church.""

The large funeral home they rented to hold the ceremony was moved into a small, private chapel within the same venue.

Face masks concealed the anguish on the faces of mourners dressed in red and black, as they stood several feet apart with heads bowed in remembrance of a highly respected man, who established churches in parts of West Africa.

Livestreaming burials

At Transitions, Ghana's largest private funeral home, a once heavy flow of ceremonies now trickles at a slow pace.

Genevieve Carnelius, the general manager, stated that finances and operations have been badly affected, but says her priority now is to work with clients like Obed to remotely reschedule their loved ones' funerals to uncertain future dates.

The home currently offers online live streaming from their chapel, where Ampadu-Asiamah's burial service took place, and where mourners across the globe can view the ceremonies of their loved ones.

Once a lucrative sector, businesses catering to funerals are reeling.

Maryam Abdullah is a fashion designer who sews traditional garments primarily for weddings and funerals.

In an empty shop once bustling with customers, she sighed as she explained how Covid-19 has affected her business.

""No one is coming. Even the people who have already brought cloths for me to sew have not returned to pick them up, said Maryam. She understands why, though. ""If this is what it takes to stop the spread of this coronavirus, I am okay.""

For now, she prefers her clients to stay at home because she feels more protected from contracting the virus herself, but it will only be a matter of time before funds run dry, she added.

A stray from traditional customs

Shaking hands with the family of the deceased is a deep-rooted tradition in many Ghanaian tribes that has taken place for hundreds of years and has become a mandatory part of ceremonies to show respect for the dead, says Queen Naa Tsotsoo Soyoo I, a Ghanaian Queen mother, who forms part of a powerful group of traditional women leaders.

She explained how significant the ban on mass funeral gatherings has affected the customs of such ceremonies.

""A significant part of funerals is bringing families together to embrace through handshakes, hugs and to mourn in close proximity of one another,"" said Queen Naa.

""The immediate implication of what is now taking place is that families will be unable to connect. This is something that has never happened in generations and it is definitely going to have a social impact.""

Coffin made and painted to resemble a mermaid for Ga tribal priestess of sea god carried by funeral guests.

Despite all the sudden changes to traditional practices at funerals, she acknowledged that certain inherent rites will never go away. For example, in Islam, the second largest religion practiced in Ghana, senior Muslim members of the community must recite Quranic verses over the deceased immediately after designated family members perform a ritual cleansing of the body.

The person must be buried within 24 hours of death.

""With all that is going on, the testament of a funeral will always be a view of how a person lived life and the core of every funeral is that the individual is sent off with respect and dignity,"" she added.

No one can predict how long the effects of Covid-19 will alter lives as we once knew it. But Queen Naa is certain of one thing thing. ""There will be many celebrations of life when this is all over.""",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/world/africa/ghana-burial-traditions-intl/index.html
