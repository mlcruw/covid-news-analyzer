A vast majority of those infected with the coronavirus will develop only mild to moderate symptoms. But many people remain frightened and wonder how and when to seek medical care.

Percent infected by 25 50 75% No control measures Some control measures Severe control measures Three scenarios for how the outbreak could spread. Percent infected by 25 50 75%

The coronavirus has infected far more people in the United States than testing has shown so far, and stringent measures to limit social contact in parts of the country not yet seeing many cases are needed to significantly stem the tide of illness and death in the coming months.

Those are the conclusions of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve based on what is known about the virus. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as America adopts unprecedented measures to control the outbreak.

But they offer a stark warning: Even if the country cut its rate of transmission in half — a tall order — some 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.

The growth is driven by Americans with mild symptoms who are carrying and spreading the virus without being aware that they have it, the researchers say. The number of undetected cases — 11 times more than has been officially reported, they estimate — reflects how far behind the United States has fallen in testing for the virus.

New York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary measures over the past week, the researchers say. New York City’s outbreak, the nation’s largest, grew to more than 4,000 known cases on Friday and is likely to increase many times over even in a favorable scenario.

On the other hand, parts of the country without large clusters of cases could still avoid the worst of the outbreak — if they impose measures like closing schools, banning mass gatherings and testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts. The epidemic would then spread inland at a much slower pace and strike with less severity, the estimates say.

But controls would need to be put in place immediately, and everywhere.

“We’re looking at something that’s catastrophic on a level that we have not seen for an infectious disease since 1918,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and the leader of the research team, referring to the Spanish flu. “And it’s requiring sacrifices we haven’t seen since World War II. There are going to be enormous disruptions. There’s no easy way out.”

Controls in many places have already changed the fabric of American life. Restaurants and schools have closed, people are working from home and travelers have put off trips — all changes that should reduce the rate of infection. In California, New York and Illinois, officials have announced more stringent directives aimed at stopping the spread. That means that at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home in the coming days, and more states are expected to follow suit.

But other places have resisted. Bars and restaurants remain open in Wichita, Kan., in a county that reported its first case on Thursday night, and in Knoxville, Tenn., where reports of the virus have been scarce. Some malls remain open in Chicago, recreational marijuana shops in Oregon, and some retail chains nationwide. Many businesses are still requiring workers to come into the office.

“I’m not really supportive yet of restricting things further or closing down,” said Pete Meitzner, head of the Board of County Commissioners in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, a city of about 400,000. Mr. Meitzner said he was growing increasingly anxious at the possibility that people who do not know they are ill might spread the virus, but that he also needed to consider the fate of workers as the community decided whether to close buildings.

“Some of our public offices and buildings are, but I do feel horrible for our restaurant workers and our hospitality workers at our hotels,” he said. “They are really suffering.”

Of the area’s relative dearth of cases, Mr. Meitzner added, “We don’t know for sure if we’re lucky or what.”

The scenarios do not estimate what effect individual local actions will have on the outbreak. But if the country as a whole does not take collective action, they suggest that Sedgwick County could see a significant proportion of its population — hundreds of thousands of people — infected with the virus in the next two months. If the country, as a whole, can reduce rates of transmission by 50 percent, Sedgwick County could instead see fewer than 1,000 cases in that time.

Several researchers not involved in the Columbia University analysis who reviewed the findings said they made sense and broadly agreed with their own thinking. Even in places that now appear to have few cases, they said, officials should act sooner rather than later.

“You have to think of this as an insurance for the future: The earlier you do it, the greater effect you have on the virus,” said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, who said the estimates were in line with his own projections. “It’s better to take excessive precautions than not.”

The economic challenges of that loom.

“We’re staying open until someone forces us to shut down,” Beau McKee, the general manager at Not Watson’s Kitchen and Bar in Knoxville, said in a telephone interview, as dishes clattered in the background. “I feel like those people that are vulnerable know who they are and they should be careful, and we should continue testing. But small businesses are getting crushed.”

Mr. McKee said he has grown increasingly worried about how the virus could affect his own father, in his 70s, but that there were other worries too. “At least we can offer a handful of people good-paying jobs and when we get out of this and we’re on the other side, we’ll hopefully have gained more clientele by doing so because we kind of stuck it out and didn’t wave the white flag,” he said.

The Columbia researchers’ model works by observing the behavior of the outbreak in the United States up until March 13, based on case records compiled by The New York Times, commuting patterns and other data.

The researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2. Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found.

Those factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread.

The estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with the available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise impact of unprecedented measures that America has already put in place to control the outbreak.

But the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.

A worst-case scenario is unlikely to play out. A handful of countries, including China and South Korea, have managed to slow down their own fast-moving outbreaks through tracking and isolating sick people and reducing social contact. It is not known if measures imposed in the last week have started slowing the outbreak in the United States.

But the researchers’ estimates show the enormity of the task. As in China, most of those who have been infected but not tested are likely to have mild symptoms, or none at all, the researchers say. That means they can spread the virus without being aware they are infected.

Several researchers said that the slow pace of testing in the United States is one major reason the proportion of unreported infections is so high here. Despite a ramping up of testing in recent days, the United States still lags both Italy and South Korea in the total number of people tested and in testing per-capita, figures show.

This map shows how many people the model estimates could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now.

One scenario — which is unlikely — simulates what could happen without any intervention. A second scenario envisions what would happen with some control measures, such as partial adherance to social distancing guidlines and a patchwork of government-imposed restrictions on work, travel, and dining out. A third envisions severe control measures: strict adherance across the country to social distancing, working remotely, closing schools and restaurants and banning large gatherings.

Three scenarios for each county These are rough estimates of how the virus could spread, but they are inherently uncertain, especially many months in the future. Projections are based on case reports as of March 13.

New York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Dr. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates.

“This is serious and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive,” Dr. Vespignani said. “We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them.”

In the days since New York’s first recorded case, on March 1, the state has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to New Rochelle, an early focal point of the outbreak; New York City has closed schools and barred dining in at restaurants and watching Broadway shows.

But in places like Wichita, some parts of life have yet to change. In that city, bars and restaurants are allowed to operate freely as long as they keep crowds to fewer than 50 people.

Still, Beverly Salas, an owner of Egg Cetera, a downtown restaurant that serves brunch and late-night bites for the bar crowd, said she chose to close the restaurant anyway. “It was a hard decision, honestly, because we have no more income coming in,” Ms. Salas, 24, said. But her customers include nurses from a nearby hospital and many people who are in their 60s or older, she said, and the thought that someone might somehow contract the illness at her small restaurant was too much for her to bear.

“I’m looking at other places like Italy and trying to avoid going through that,” she said. “Why are we not taking it as seriously as New York, Chicago, or even Kansas City?

While there, I kept hearing about a young doctor with Covid who was fighting for his life in the ICU. Things just were not getting better. The amount of anger and frustration and sadness that I felt. Just the idea of losing my son was unbearable. But ultimately, he survived. I’m Andres Maldonado, and I’m an ER doctor here in the Bronx. I’m a healthy 27-year-old guy. No medical problems. But I got Covid-19. I was so sick that, at one point, I thought I was going to die. This is my story, which should be a warning to everyone. I was working mostly in the two weeks where it was really starting to ramp up. It was quite dire. Stretchers lined two or three deep. You were just being called from one patient to the next. “I need a vent.” “I need a vent.” How many vents do we have? All these questions that we had never considered, ever. They’re starting to ration out these N95s. We’re in a spot where we’re wearing stuff a day at a time, multiple days at a time. A lot of these patients that I’ve met are scared. I want to be able to help people when they need you the most. There was a patient, and she coughed right on my face. And that’s when I got scared. What if she does have coronavirus? Day one, March 23rd. It was the middle of the night. I started to feel just really horrible chills. But I thought to myself, oh, you know, I’ve been sick like this before. You know, I’ve had a virus. I’m young. I’m 27. I’m invincible. Like, you know, nothing can touch me. Day two. When I would take a really deep breath, it would hurt. Day three. Fevers that would come up to 102. But I would take Tylenol, and I’d be OK. Day four. I spoke to my mom. Through the whole week, it was like, what’s going to happen, what’s going to happen? Day five was actually when I went to go get tested. Day six, and my coronavirus is positive. Our worst fears were coming true. Day seven. I was pacing my room, and I was just thinking, come on, Tylenol, just start working already. It worked a little bit, but then the fever would come back two hours later. Day eight. Couldn’t finish my sentences without taking a breath. That’s when it clicked, I can’t continue to stay home. Day nine, March 31st. Andres calls me, and he tells me, the first thing is, ‘Mommy, don’t panic.’ And when he says don’t panic, what do you think I’m going to do? And he goes, ‘I’m going to the ER right now. I don’t feel good.’ And I said, ‘what’s wrong?’ And he said, ‘I’m short of breath.’ I met Mike Jones, our leader in residency, inside of a tent in front of the ER. He came to the hospital where I was that day. Every patient with COVID reaches a critical time period where you can see that they’re heading in the wrong direction. They’re kind of going over that tilt of that cliff, heading in the direction where they may need intubation. At least 70% to 80% of patients who were placed on ventilators were dying. So we tried very hard to avoid intubation. Everyone who was there knew me. All the nurses, Mike Jones. I know Dr. Romo personally. They were alarmed. Just looking at him through the window, it just felt like I got kicked in the stomach. I ended up writing ‘we love you’ and taping it on the window so he could see it. I went in the room and I cried. I cried. I wanted to remain strong and support Andres, and not let him see that I was worried. I was terrified. When I walk into the room, I realize that he was breathing at a faster rate than he was before. That was a significant moment for me because I have been in that position where you see a patient, they were critically ill. I knew that sense of urgency meant that they were considering more invasive options. We decided that he was getting sicker, and that maybe he was going to need to be intubated. We made the decision to admit him to the intensive care unit. I said, ‘call the ICU right now. Let them know he’s coming.’ I heard Dr. Romo say he needs to be placed on a high-flow nasal cannula. A device that provides a large volume and high velocity of oxygen to a patient. So we brought him right up and started the high-flow nasal cannula. The only thought in my head was, just please get better on this. Please, please work. I woke up in the middle of the night. I heard a lot of commotion outside, and people turned on all the lights. I looked at the monitor to check my vital signs, and overhead, you hear— “Rapid response. Rapid response.” They’re calling for extra doctors to report two rooms down from me. She was a 25-year-old. She just kept saying, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.’ Then she had this cardiac arrest. Her heart stopped. And I was terrified. You know, I was thinking, that’s two doors down, and that could have been me. Sometimes, you think about what would happen if you would die. And then you think about your parents if you died, the permanent distress they’d probably feel. And I haven’t really seen my husband cry, and he did break down. I have never seen him like that. He went on his knees, and he was asking God to please save Andres and take him instead of Andres. My dad doesn’t get like that. You know, he’s serious. He’s like a military guy. Just let me get over this. Just the idea of losing my son was unbearable. Despite thinking I can die, I still felt determined to somehow get better. And the way that translated to me and my medical mind was focus on your breathing. One breath at a time. Think about the air going in, out. Try and take deep breaths. Makes you cough? OK., take a break. Try again. And then at some magical point, we turned the corner. What’s up, Andres? Welcome back. Hey, thank you. Wow. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] (CHANTING) Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! I’m completely overwhelmed right now. It’s a victory. Every victory helps us try to help the next patient get through this. It was an amazing feeling of triumph. It was like, yes, we did this, we beat it. They saved my life. 24 of our 84 emergency medicine residents have been out sick during this crisis. The number of health care workers that have died is horrible. All health care worker infections are preventable. I really, truly believe that. I believe the government failed everybody. Oh, only 400 died today, not 700 like last week. It’s like, for goodness sake, we’re talking about human lives. It’s a virus. It will infect you. It doesn’t care who you are, where you’re from, what you do, who you support politically. It just doesn’t care. Please appreciate your life more before you choose to ignore the stay at home orders or the quarantine, because anyone can get sick.",nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/opinion/sunday/young-doctor-coronavirus.html
['Jennifer Senior'],2020-05-01,How Will Joe Biden Respond to Tara Reade's Accusation? - The New York Times,"Which is not an excuse, by the way. It is merely an explanation.

Thus far, I’ve felt unease and confusion about Reade’s story. Some aspects of it have the uncomfortable ring of truth — like how she says Biden fumbled “You’re OK, you’re fine” in the aftermath of the alleged encounter — and some don’t, like the idea that this horrible incident happened in a more or less public place. That the details of Reade’s narrative have changed over time also gives me pause. But the idea that a former neighbor would be willing to come forward and confirm, on the record, that she’d heard graphic details about this encounter long ago is very troubling, to say the least.",nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/joe-biden-tara-reade-metoo.html
['Bret Stephens'],2020-05-01,Opinion | Joe Biden and the Presumption of Innocence,"Above all: The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Let’s not start with the Brett Kavanaugh precedent. Or with the vindictive excesses of the #MeToo movement, typified by the Aziz Ansari story, the “Shitty Media Men List” and Al Franken’s resignation from the Senate. Go back further than Juanita Broaddrick’s appearance, like Banquo’s ghost, at the second debate in 2016, which did so much to blunt the Clinton campaign’s case about Donald Trump’s moral unfitness for office.",nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/joe-biden-tara-reade.html

When I stand on the gravel road that runs along the section line by my house I can look in any direction across the waving grass and, other than the modest huddle of buildings and fencing that compose our ranch, see little evidence of human development. To say it is remote is like saying water is wet. We aren’t Iowa remote or Wisconsin remote. This is the American steppe, where the population density is one person per square mile.",nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/meat-shortage-farming.html

Most summers, Mr. Byrom hires a staff of about 50 people, with 20 of them coming from Asia and Europe, which he knows this year will be impossible. But he is hearing from former campers and former counselors who no longer have full time jobs or whose plans for the summer have fallen through because of the virus.
