['Bob Price'],2020-05-05,REPORT: Texas Hair Salon Owner Gets Jail Sentence for Violating Coronavirus Lockdown Order,"A Dallas hair salon owner who defied a Coronavirus lockdown order will spend seven days in jail, according to a local news report. The salon owner refused to keep her business closed and defied a direct cease and desist order from Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins in April.

“Shelley Luther, a Dallas hair salon owner who opened in violation of the governor’s executive order, sentenced to 7 days in jail for civil / criminal contempt of court and fined $7,000,” CBSDFW reported Andrea Lucia tweeted on Tuesday.

Lucia later corrected her tweet and reported the fine to be $500 per day — $3,500 so far and growing.

Correction: The amount of the fine is $3500 and growing. $500/ day for the 7 days the salon was open. $500/ per day for every day it remains open through Friday, when the governor has said all salons may open. — Andrea Lucia (@CBS11Andrea) May 5, 2020

The move to fine and incarcerate Luther comes on the same day that Governor Greg Abbott announced that hair salons will be able to re-open on Friday, May 8.

In April, Salon Á la Mode owner Shelley Luther re-opened her hair salon in defiance of orders by the county that she remained closed, Breitbart Texas reported on April 25. “Every owner of every salon should use their own best judgement when to reopen,” the Texas governor said during a press conference that occurred at the same time the fine and jail sentence were announced in Dallas.

At this time, it is not clear what judge issued the contempt order that includes the seven-day jail sentence and the fine pf $500 per day.

Luther told WFAA ABC8 she is “prepared to take on whatever it is that comes with” re-opening her business. She said she had to choose between paying her lease or her mortgage this month because of the stay-at-home order.

“I don’t want to cause any problems, but when you’re out of money someone has to stand up and say that they’re not helping us by not letting us work,” she explained. Luther is unable to perform any of her three jobs — musician, makeup artist, and hairstylist — because of the lockdown of the county.

Now, according to the local CBS affiliate’s reporter, “whatever it is that comes with” is a seven-day jail term for contempt and a fine of $$500 per day.

“I’m behind on my mortgage,” she explained at the time. “I know a lot of my stylists haven’t paid their mortgage. It’s either come in and make money to be able to feed your family or stay home and freak out.”

“Obviously I don’t want anyone to get sick and I don’t want the virus to spread,” Luther continued. “It will be one of the safer places for people to go rather than going to Walmart or Home Depot.”

“I will not pay the fine,” the defiant salon owner told reporters in April.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-05,Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hospitalized for 'Benign Gallbladder Condition',"The Supreme Court announced Tuesday evening that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, has undergone a non-surgical procedure for acute cholecystitis, a minor gallbladder condition.

Ginsburg received treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, on Tuesday and is now resting comfortably. She is scheduled to participate in Wednesday’s arguments via teleconference, said the high court.

“Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent non-surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis, a benign gallbladder condition, this afternoon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland,” the Supreme Court said in a statement. “Following oral arguments on Monday, the Justice underwent outpatient tests at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., that confirmed she was suffering from a gallstone that had migrated to her cystic duct, blocking it and causing an infection. The Justice is resting comfortably and plans to participate in the oral argument teleconference tomorrow morning remotely from the hospital. She expects to stay in the hospital for a day or two.”

The announcement comes after Ginsburg was hospitalized at Johns Hopkins Hospital for two nights with the chills and a fever in late November.

Ginsburg — often referred to as the “notorious RBG” in liberal circles — has experienced a string of health issues over the years. The justice broke three of her ribs in a fall in November 2018 and underwent lung cancer surgery in December 2018. She received radiation treatment for pancreatic cancer in August.

Ginsburg also survived colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009.

Despite ongoing speculation of her possible retirement, Ginsburg signaled last summer that she has no plans to step down from the bench.

President Jimmy Carter appointed Ginsburg to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1980 and was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/supreme-court-ruth-bader-ginsburg-hospitalized-for-benign-gallbladder-condition/
['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,"Politico Founder: I Want a Joe Biden ‘Coronation’, Even If He Is Guilty of Sexual Assault","Martin Tolchin, a founder of Politico and former New York Times correspondent in Washington, DC, published a letter to the editor of the Times Tuesday calling for a Joe Biden “coronation” regardless of claims of sexual assault.

The letter came in response to a recent Times editorial calling for the Democratic National Committee to investigate claims by Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer, who claims Biden assaulted her in 1993.

Tolchin wrote that he did not want Reade’s claims investigated — or anything else about Biden — because all he wanted was to see Trump defeated in November.

The letter, in full, follows (original emphasis):

I totally disagree with this editorial. I don’t want an investigation. I want a coronation of Joe Biden. Would he make a great president? Unlikely. Would he make a good president? Good enough. Would he make a better president than the present occupant? Absolutely. I don’t want justice, whatever that may be. I want a win, the removal of Donald Trump from office, and Mr. Biden is our best chance. Suppose an investigation reveals damaging information concerning his relationship with Tara Reade or something else, and Mr. Biden loses the nomination to Senator Bernie Sanders or someone else with a minimal chance of defeating Mr. Trump. Should we really risk the possibility? Martin Tolchin

Alexandria, Va.

The writer is a former member of The Times’s Washington bureau and a founder of Politico.

The Democratic National Committee rejected the Times‘ suggestion, calling it “absurd on its face.”

Critics noted that Tolchin’s attitude confirmed public suspicion of the Beltway media as hopelessly partisan and uninterested in the truth.

David Martosko, a White House correspondent for the Daily Mail, tweeted that Tolchin’s letter was “Exhibit A demonstrating why less than 1/3 of Americans trust the news media.”

['Pam Key'],2020-05-05,Pelosi: Biden Sexual Assault Allegation Is a ‘Closed Issue’,"Tuesday on MSNBC’s “The Beat,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) dismissed the sexual assault allegations against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden as a closed issue.

Host Melber said, “I do want to play Joe Biden’s response. As viewers know, he has publicly addressed this allegation. Let’s take a listen.”

In a clip, Biden said, “It is not true. I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened, and it didn’t. It never happened. I’m asking the secretary of the Senate today to identify whether any such document exists. If it does, make it public.”

Melber said, “Joe Biden speaking out just days ago on that allegation of a sexual assault. Now that he has given that answer, do you view this as a closed issue, or what is your response?”

Pelosi said, “Well, it is for me. I have said I am proud to support Joe Biden for president. I believe him when he says it didn’t happen. But I also believe when he says let them look into the records. And that’s what they should do. But I’m not going to answer this question again. I will just say I have every confidence that Joe Biden will be a great president of the United States. Not only because of the person of integrity that he is but the person of vision that he is for just some of the things you talked about, about health care for all Americans, about job security, about the kitchen table issues that he is so familiar with in his own family when his father lost his own job. Joe Biden is Joe. He brings those values and his personal experience to a vision for America that is about fairness and not trickle-down economics, but bubble up from that kitchen table, from working families in our country.”

['John Nolte'],2020-05-05,"Nolte: Biden, Media, Feminists Resurrect Clinton Playbook to Destroy Reade","What’s happening to Tara Reade at the hands of the corporate media, feminists, and Joe Biden is a disheartening return to the 1990s, to the infamous Bill Clinton era.

Reade has come forward with one of the most credible sexual assault allegations we have seen in a very long time. She alleges that in 1993, while working in his Senate office, then Sen. Biden (D-DE) sexually harassed her, sexually assaulted her, and then fired her in retaliation for filing a harassment complaint.

Tara Reade is Joe Biden’s eighth accuser.

Tara Reade has five witnesses who corroborate she told them about the alleged assault at or near the time.

If her claim is eventually debunked, Tara Reade risked prison last month by filing a formal criminal complaint against Biden.

We now have video of Tara Reade’s anguished mother calling into a 1993 edition of CNN’s Larry King Live to ask advice about her daughter’s problems with a “prominent senator.”

Tara Reade has challenged investigative reporters to dig into her story.

Finally, Tara Reade is calling for Biden to make his Senate papers available in the hopes her harassment complaint will be found.

Tara Reade is behaving like a woman with nothing to hide.

Joe Biden denies the allegation, but is behaving like a man with everything to hide.

And in an effort to allow Biden to hide straight through to the November election, and in an effort to personally destroy Tara Reade, Biden, feminists, and the media have decided to resurrect the Clinton-era Playbook.

Those of us old enough to remember the 1990s, the way in which the media and feminists circled the wagons to protect Clinton, are very familiar with these cynical tactics.

For eight long years, we watched as the media smeared Paula Jones (Clinton would eventually settle his sexual harassment lawsuit with her for more than she originally asked) as trailer trash, attacked lifelong Democrat Kathleen Willey as a gold-digging widow, attacked Monica Lewinsky as a crazed stalker, and ignored Juanita Broaddrick’s credible rape allegation.

When these women refused to be ignored, they were smeared by a media determined to protect a Democrat. When they demanded justice, the Clinton Machine sent out its surrogates to lie on Clinton’s behalf. When these women went public, so-called feminists came right out and said they didn’t care.

And now it’s happening again. Despite Reade’s increasing credibility, despite #MeToo-era feminists and the media assuring us the hideous Clinton era would never return, along with the Biden Machine, they’re all using the exact same playbook to destroy Tara Reade.

To begin with, just like Bill Clinton did, Biden is refusing to be transparent. In this case, he will not allow anyone to look at his Senate papers (not even a trusted judge).

Further, Biden has still not given his version for Reade leaving his Senate office in 1993. An intern who worked under Reade says Reade abruptly disappeared one day. Biden has still not explained his version of why she left, nor have the media asked him for his version.

Just like Bill Clinton, Biden is spreading lies about Reade. Biden’s campaign came up with a series of talking points to discredit Reade, and all three of those talking points have been exposed as lies. Even the far-left New York Times was forced to admit one was a lie.

Just like Bill Clinton, Biden’s surrogates are threatening, menacing, and publicly bullying Reade while the media either ignore or encourage this behavior.

Worse still, just like Bill Clinton, Biden is sending high-profile women, like Stacey Abrams, out into the media with those talking points, which means he’s sending women out to lie on his behalf.

As far as the feminists… Just like the 90s, here we go again…

Feminist attorney Lisa Bloom says she believes Biden sexually assaulted Reade but still supports the man she believes committed a sexual assault.

Leading #MeToo figure Alyssa Milano has twisted herself into a pretzel attempting to justify her staggering leap from “believe all women” to I still “admire” and “support” Joe Biden.

The Washington Post’s Ruth Marcus, Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times, and the Nation’s Joan Walsh — all feminists, all #MeToo champions — have, just like their 90s predecessors, willingly sacrificed their credibility to protect Biden.

High-profile feminists like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sens. Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) are openly siding with Biden over Reade, openly dismissing her story as bogus, even as Biden spreads lies and refuses transparency.

And in the most 1990s of 1990 flashbacks, Hillary Clinton, who has a 30 year history of protecting alleged predators, stands with Biden.

Today’s Hollywood feminists, those who were the most strident about #NeverAgain and #MeToo, have eagerly joined the campaign to destroy Reade or to dismiss Biden’s disturbing history — including Meghan McCain and Whoopi Goldberg.

And so, just like the now-disgraced National Organization for Women (NOW) did in the 90s, the #MeToo movement has been sacrificed, has gone down in the flames of its own silent complicity to protect a Democrat.

The media have been equally reprehensible.

In a desperately dishonest effort this weekend to kill Reade’s credibility forever, the Associated Press straight-up lied about Reade changing her story about the harassment complaint she filed, when the record proves the exact opposite is true.

We also learned the AP had the Reade story all the way back in 2019 but refused to report it at the time, and only finally reported it this weekend with that deceptive smear attempt.

The far-left New York Times scrubbed Biden’s disturbing and well-documented history of inappropriately touching women from what it sold as an exhaustive investigation into Reade’s allegation, when it was nothing of the sort.

Over the weekend, the Times even went so far as to demand the media stop investigating the story and allow — no joke — the Democrat National Committee to handle the investigation.

Male media staffers who pose as superhero journalists eager to protect victimized women, people like CNN’s Jake Tapper and NBC’s Chuck Todd, had the opportunity to make big news by asking Biden about the allegation during an interview; they chose instead to protect him by not bringing it up.

Female staffers who pose as superhero media feminists, like MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace and Andrea Martin, are wrist-flicking a credible assault allegation to protect their guy.

Yes, just like the Clinton era, and after we were assured that sickening spectacle never be allowed to repeat itself, we once again have feminists, Democrats, and the media gleefully victimizing another credible victim.

P.S. My prediction is this… In about 20 years we’ll discover Tara Reade told the truth, and as a result, the corrupt media will engage in a cycle of hand-wringing and soul searching and promises that they will never again allow a credible victim to be demeaned and dismissed…

And that promise will last right up until the moment a high-profile Democrat is hit with a credible allegation.

['David Ng'],2020-05-05,Michael Moore: Earth Will Take ‘Revenge’ on Mankind for ‘Trying to Choke It to F**king Death’,"Documentary filmmaker and left-wing activist Michael Moore is predicting a doomsday environmental scenario for the planet that will dwarf the coronavirus pandemic. Who’s to blame? Humans, of course.

In Tuesday’s episode of his podcast, the Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker framed the coronavirus as Mother Earth’s revenge against mankind. “Take this moment, take this virus, as earth’s slap in our collective face,” he said, adding that the Chinese coronavirus is nature “trying to tell our species to back off, slow down, and change your ways.”

On today’s Rumble podcast I lay it all out—my radical environmental manifesto: We are in a planetary emergency and no amount of collaborating with the enemy – capitalism/profit motive/greed – will save us. We need a new way, new leadership. Time to fight. https://t.co/Ow2h7OevUs — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) May 5, 2020

Michael Moore warned that Earth has the power to wipe out mankind in a way that will surpass the current global crisis.

“You do understand that this planet can remove all of us with the snap of its fingers,” Moore said. “If you think COVID-19 has been a bummer, trust me, you literally can’t imagine just how awful Earth’s revenge will be against us for trying to choke it to fucking death.”

Moore added that humans lie at the root of the problem.

“We are in a serious multi-level planetary emergency and that emergency involves climate. water, food, top soil, over consumption, species that have gone missing, our ocean life — what’s left of it — and humans. Mostly humans. And our human, non-sensical, greed-induced behavior and systems,” he said.

Moore said that the environmental movement has failed to produce meaningful results.

“We are very grateful to our environmental leaders for years of brilliant research,” he said. “Except, it hasn’t worked. We are worse off since the first Earth Day 50 years ago. Not better off, worse off. I don’t even need to tell you that. You already know.”

“We can no longer solar panel and windmill our way out of this disaster,” he added.

Moore’s disenchantment with the environmental movement arose last month while promoting the new documentary Planet of the Humans, which highlights the failures of the mainstream environmentalists while also assigning blame to corporate interests as well as solar and wind energy companies and electric car manufacturers.

“All the things we set out to do… you and I both know we have not done that,” Moore said.

The filmmaker noted that 90 percent of large fish in the wild, like halibut, are now gone. “We ate them,” he said.

He added many mammals in the wild have also disappeared. “We eat them too.”

['Amy Furr'],2020-05-05,Oregon Salon Owner to Reopen Business Despite Stay Home Order,"A salon owner is planning to reopen her business Tuesday in Salem, Oregon, despite Gov. Kate Brown’s stay-at-home orders.

When Glamour Salon owner Lindsey Graham closed her business weeks ago due to the coronavirus lockdown, she began to miss her clients and fellow stylists, according to KGW 8.

“We have incredibly deep relationships where we share everything with each other and we laugh with each other,” she said.

However, Graham also misses having an income and explained that not being able to provide for her husband and three kids has been difficult.

“We’re not entirely sure where next month’s funds are gonna come from,” she explained.

To provide for her family, the salon owner decided to open her business again even though Brown recently extended Oregon’s state of emergency until July 6.

“The new executive order gives the governor the legal authority to maintain the orders she’s issued thus far — including the stay-home order, a moratorium on residential and commercial evictions and other financial stimulus measures — and issue new ones as she sees fit,” according to the Oregonian.

Despite the extension, Graham said she wanted to lead by example.

“People are now looking up to me to be kind of the leader in this. You know, how’s this going to go for you? Are you going to be able to open your doors and provide for your family, and if that goes well maybe I can open my doors and provide for my family,” she said.

Monday, a representative from the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health agency paid her a visit and warned that she could face fines if she reopened her business.

“That’s an ending for us,” Graham said, adding, “That can’t happen.”

Still, the salon owner resolved to open her doors regardless of the potential backlash.

“The government has backed us into a corner and driven fear into us so that we can’t even take a stand and earn our living. It’s completely unconstitutional and it’s devastating and it’s immoral,” she stated.

Three of her four stylists were scheduled to work on Tuesday. They will wear masks and gloves and only one client will be allowed inside the salon at a time, according to Graham.

Monday, Facebook users expressed their opinions about the owner’s decision to reopen.

“Your [sic] not special, and you are not essential, OHA needs to step in and start fining all and shutting down, pure disrespect for your fellow humans,” one person commented.

The case of the order of Catholic nuns who care for the elderly sick and poor is among the handful the Supreme Court has decided to hear telephonically during the coronavirus outbreak.

The Little Sisters are hoping the high Court will finally end their seven-year legal battle against the Obama-era mandate that requires them to provide free contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees through health insurance plans.

Former Obama-era Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – an abortion activist – and bureaucrats in her department inserted the mandate into Obamacare. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised “accommodations” that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be footing the bill for the federal government’s mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures. In reality, the faith groups were being asked to passively approve of the contraceptives.

Left-wing groups such as Planned Parenthood claim women should obtain free birth control and that the Trump administration is forcing women to pay for their own birth control when they choose to have sex. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted from its own rule at least 25 million Americans – including large corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling, as well as the U.S. military and large cities like New York City – through various exemption allowances, with little pushback from the left.

In May 2016, in the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court unanimously decided to send back to the lower courts the case of the Little Sisters, in effect ordering the government not to fine the Sisters for noncompliance with the HHS mandate and for not informing the government that the mandate is in conflict with their beliefs.

One year later, President Donald Trump issued the first executive order ever to defend religious liberty. In the order, Trump directed HHS to develop rules for rights of conscience regarding abortion that would protect faith groups such as the Little Sisters.

The Trump administration announced its new rule the following October that would protect the nuns and other religious non-profits from being coerced by the federal government to provide services in their healthcare plans that violate their faith beliefs.

The rule provided full protection for Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions and acknowledged that the contraceptive mandate concerns serious issues of moral concern, including those involving human life.

However, the following December, a federal judge in Pennsylvania blocked the Trump administration’s rule that exempted employers with religious or moral objections to the Obamacare mandate.

U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone, an Obama appointee, said the state was “likely to suffer serious and irreparable harm” if she did not order a preliminary injunction.

Beetlestone’s order followed a lawsuit filed by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who posted on Twitter the ruling was a “critical victory for millions of women and families and for the rule of law”:

The Federalist Society will also host a Courthouse Steps Teleforum Wednesday at 3:30 pm ET on the Supreme Court case Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania.

Becket states at issue in the Little Sisters’ case are:

Whether a litigant who is directly protected by an administrative rule and has been allowed to intervene to defend it lacks standing to appeal a decision invalidating the rule if the litigant is also protected by an injunction from a different court; and Whether the federal government lawfully exempted religious objectors from the regulatory requirement to provide health plans that include contraceptive coverage.

In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, noted the Little Sisters are currently fighting two battles:

They not only must fight to keep the elderly poor they care for safe and alive during the coronavirus pandemic, they also have to fight extremist ideologues who think nuns should provide abortion pills in their healthcare plans too. The Supreme Court already told the government to accommodate the nuns’ conscience rights and the president issued an executive order ensuring that employers cannot be forced to violate their religious beliefs.

“Nevertheless, attorneys general like Xavier Becerra and Josh Shapiro just won’t stop harassing these women and keeping them from their life-saving work on behalf our nation’s most vulnerable,” McGuire added.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/little-sisters-of-the-poor-return-to-u-s-supreme-court-to-defend-religious-freedom/
['John Hayward'],2020-05-05,India Offers Land Pool Twice the Size of Luxembourg to Companies,"Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that India is “developing a land pool nearly double the size of Luxembourg to lure businesses moving out of China.”

The land pool is not one contiguous area, but a total of 461,589 hectares of industrial property that will be offered for speedy lease at good prices to businesses that wish to relocate out of China after the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Bloomberg, India’s plans for poaching foreign firms from China are still being fleshed out, but one of the most urgent priorities was signaling to corporate buyers that India’s normally slow and confusing process for acquiring land and construction permits would be greatly streamlined. No less of a global business behemoth than Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Aramco has been thwarted from building a $44 billion refinery in India because it could not cut through a web of red tape to buy the land it needed.

Bloomberg’s anonymous source – officials from the relevant ministries declined to comment on the record – said India is looking at offering more land from its special economic zones (SEZ) to foreign buyers or renters because those areas already have “robust infrastructure in place.” The SEZs were always intended to lure foreign business so, presumably, this would mean making them larger and acting quickly to extend their infrastructure into adjacent areas.

American, Japanese, and South Korean companies were reportedly among those most interested in hearing India’s offers. The Bloomberg piece did not delve into exactly how India is marketing its locations to companies currently located in China, or what incentives will be developed specifically to persuade firms to move from China to India.

Like most other countries battling the Wuhan virus epidemic, India took a huge hit to its economic growth and employment. Contrary to the emphasis placed on bringing in foreign business clients by Bloomberg’s source, the Economic Times of India on Monday reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “fiscally constrained” administration is thinking about “reverting to a greater inward orientation,” stressing national self-reliance over global interdependence.

The Economic Times noted the contradiction between this ethos and the big push to woo foreign business away from China and suggested the Indian government should focus on ceding back the extraordinary powers it claimed during the pandemic, leave the private sector “free to rejuvenate production,” and perhaps use foreign investment captured from China to improve India’s national infrastructure for the benefit of both overseas tenants and local businesses.

The question of how likely foreign firms are to decamp from China, seeking new locations in India or elsewhere, is hotly debated. In March, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) suggested Beijing was up against a ticking clock to restore the confidence of foreign investors, lest they become a “hollow economy” after a post-pandemic exodus.

A bitter note in the SCMP’s report was that China’s most attractive feature for foreign industries, in addition to cheap labor, is the haven it provides from environmentalist hassles. China has very lax pollution rules, and Western activist groups have absolutely zero interest in pestering Beijing or its clients about them. India might not be able to offer quite the same level of indulgence.

Forbes reviewed data in April that showed American firms were already pulling out of China after the trade war, and the process accelerated during the pandemic.

“The main beneficiaries of this are the smaller southeast Asian nations, led by Vietnam. And thanks to the passing of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, Mexico, for all its problems with drug cartels, has become a favorite spot for sourcing,” Forbes noted. The same data might have inspired India to make a stronger play for industries pulling out of China.

At roughly the same time, Reuters argued that most American firms did not have short-term plans to leave China, because the logistics of moving were so uncertain and the worldwide economic depression left international corporations with less money to pay for heavy relocation costs. Also, China moved very aggressively in April to send the message that its workforce and infrastructure would return to normal performance much faster than its competitors.

“Our survey results show that companies are considering adjustments to their business strategy, but there is no mass exodus as a result of COVID-19,” declared American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai president Ker Gibbs, adding that over the longer term, the coronavirus crisis added “a new and unwelcome dimension to the conversation about decoupling.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/05/report-india-offers-land-pool-twice-size-luxembourg-companies-fleeing-china/
['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-05,WATCH: Korean Baseball Returns with Socially Distant First Pitch,"Baseball has returned to South Korea, but it certainly did not start in a way that anyone would recognize.

The first day of baseball in the Korean league began with a tradition that most Americans would recognize, the first pitch. Though, that’s where the similarities would end, as the kid selected to make the first pitch walked to home plate in a bubble.

Watch:

Nice of the hitter to take a mock swing at the kid in the bubble just before he got to home plate.

The scene would have seemed odd at any other point in world history, but not so much in our current pandemic predicament. Of course, people will take sports in any form from any country nowadays. ESPN is broadcasting six Korean baseball league games a week after the Scott Van Pelt Show, just to give American fans some much needed sports relief.

['Sean Moran'],2020-05-05,Rubio: Ratcliffe Would Be an 'Excellent' Director of National Intelligence,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday that Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) would be an “excellent” Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

The Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing on Ratcliffe’s qualifications to become the next DNI Tuesday. If confirmed to the position, he would lead the country’s 17 intelligence agencies.

During the nomination hearing, Ratcliffe promised to serve as a nonpartisan aide to the president.

“Let me be very clear: Regardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,” he said on Tuesday.

“Anyone’s views on what they want the intelligence to be will never impact the intelligence that I deliver — never,” he added. “I won’t shade intelligence for anyone.”

Rubio released a statement after the hearing, saying that Ratcliffe would serve as a great fit for the nation’s leading intelligence director.

He said in a statement:

Rep. Ratcliffe understands his top responsibility is to make sure the wide array of intelligence agencies are sharing information across lines, coordinating capabilities, and are all working in the furtherance of the same strategic aim of the 21st century. I think he would be an excellent Director of National of Intelligence, and I look forward to supporting his nomination.

Ratcliffe received praise from other members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

“He answered everything, and I think he did a very successful job at one, verifying that he’s more than capable of this job, and two will serve in an independent capacity,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC), told reporters after the hearing.

“[U.S. intelligence officials] deserve, and the country needs, the certainty of a permanent, Senate-confirmed director of national intelligence,” Burr added.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), a member of Senate GOP leadership, said that the DNI position has “gone vacant for too long.”

Breitbart News reported on Tuesday that Ratcliffe had earned high praise from former White House officials such as Andy Surabian and Tony Sayegh.

Donald Trump Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, told Breitbart News:

Congressman Ratcliffe has the experience to do this job at the highest level, and most importantly his judgment has proven to be impeccable. His many years of public service show that he is a patriot who will always put his country first and stand tall for the American people. This is a no-brainer confirmation for the Senate.

Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official said: Congressman Ratcliffe has proven through his many years of public service that he has the right judgment, temperament, and experience to make an excellent head of ODNI. He should be confirmed by the Senate as swiftly as possible.”

Tony Sayegh, a senior Trump administration official who served in both the Treasury Department and the White House, told Breitbart News, “Our nation deserves a man of John Ratcliffe’s integrity, experience, and professionalism to lead our intelligence community during these precarious times. “President Trump picked the exact right man for the exact right moment,” Sayegh added.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-05,"Harvard Law Prof: Coronavirus Is an Excuse to Dump Free Speech, Property Rights from Constitution","Harvard Law Professor Adrian Vermeule suggests using the Chinese virus pandemic as an excuse to establish a new interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, implementing Marxist policies that do away with concepts such as “free speech ideology” and “property rights.”

Adrian Vermeule, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, recently wrote a piece for the Atlantic in which he argues that traditional interpretations of the U.S. constitution have “now outlived its utility,” and that it is now time for the government to take a more centralized role in people’s lives.

Vermeule argues that “circumstances have now changed” due to the Chinese virus pandemic, and that it is now possible to imagine “moral” constitutionalism, which he says is not “enslaved to the original meaning of the Constitution,” and is also “liberated” from the narrative of “relentless expansion of individualistic autonomy.”

The professor is advocating for a new interpretation of the U.S. constitution, which he refers to as “common-good constitutionalism.”

“Such an approach,” wrote Vermeule, “should be based on the principles that government helps direct persons, associations, and society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in the interest of attaining the common good is entirely legitimate.”

Vermeule also scrutinizes “the libertarian assumptions central to free-speech law and free-speech ideology,” which he says is “forbidden to judge the quality and moral worth of public speech,” and therefore, should “fall under the ax.”

The law professor even goes as far as stating that “property rights and economic rights will also have to go,” because they “bar the state from enforcing duties of community and solidarity in the use and distribution of resources.”

Vermeule claims that this “global pandemic” makes for the perfect opportunity to implement such strategies that grow government, insisting that “it has become clear that a just governing order must have ample power to cope with large-scale crises of public health and well-being.”

The professor also noted that when he says the government should get involved in “health,” he is referring to that “in many senses, not only literal and physical but also metaphorical and social.”

Vermeule even acknowledges that “the central aim of the constitutional order is to promote good rule, not to ‘protect liberty’ as an end in itself,” and that one common-good principle will be “that no constitutional right to refuse vaccination exists.”

“Constitutional law will define in broad terms the authority of the state to protect the public’s health and well-being, protecting the weak from pandemics and scourges of many kinds,” wrote Vermeule.

The professor even goes on to admit that implementing such principles would require overriding “selfish” claims of individuals to private rights, and that his interpretation of constitutional law means that “rulers” should be afforded a “broad scope.”

Vermeule insists that “these principles include respect for the authority of rule and of rulers,” the “respect for the legitimate roles of public bodies and associations at all levels of government and society,” and “a candid willingness to ‘legislate morality,'” among other concepts.

In January, Vermeule’s colleague, chemistry chairman Charles Lieber, was charged with fraud over his private financial relationship with the Chinese government. Lieber was paid millions of dollars by the Chinese government to work on “collaborative projects” between Harvard and the Chinese government.

This week, Republicans in the House of Representatives announced that they have launched an investigation into China’s influence on American universities and colleges.

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-05,Dr. Birx Questions Accuracy of IHME Model Predicting More Deaths,"Coronavirus Task Force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx on Tuesday questioned the accuracy of the updated Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington (IHME) model for coronavirus deaths.

“I think that particular model is very sensitive to actual any changes in the mortality and very much utilizes that data,” she said during an interview with reporters on Tuesday.

The release of the updated model projects an increase in coronavirus deaths to 74,073 in the United States by August 4, fueling a narrative that the virus was not going away as quickly as the president has predicted.

Birx said she looked forward to an IHME model adjustment in another week, pointing out that their prediction for deaths expected on Tuesday was already higher than the actual data.

She also said that the model likely failed to note the continued mitigation parameters in both phases of the reopening plan.

“I’m not sure all of the mitigation parameters were taken into account,” she said.

President Donald Trump also expressed skepticism about the IHME model on Tuesday, noting their failure to include metrics for social distancing.

“Look, models have been very inaccurate, I’ve seen models that are very inaccurate,” Trump said at the White House when asked about the updated predictions.

Birx also said that the IHME model likely had not taken into account the task force guidelines for asking seniors and more vulnerable communities to continue sheltering in place in both phases of the reopening America plan.

“That’s a consistent element that needs to be present,” she said. “That was put there very intentionally to make sure that in opening up America, that very clear statement, that we were protecting the vulnerable we felt that was absolutely essential.”

She urged states not to skip different phases of the reopening plan, and continue social mitigation protocols to help stop the spread of the virus.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/dr-deborah-birx-questions-accuracy-of-ihme-coronavirus-model-predicting-more-deaths/
['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,"South African Police Arrest Family, Including Breastfeeding Mom, While Feeding the Poor During Coronavirus","A South African man and his fiancée were arrested with their 21-month-old daughter Monday while feeding poor residents of a community near Cape Town after their toddler ran onto a beach and he ran to retrieve her.

According to Cape Talk 567 radio, Liam Bulgen of Muizenberg and his family had prepared food for residents of Vrygrond, a poor neighborhood near the False Bay coast, and were walking legally on a promenade near the beach when their toddler ran onto the sand. He retrieved the child — and they were then confronted by police.

Though the charge was initially unclear, Bulgen said, police indicated that they were being arrested for violating local regulations for the coronavirus lockdown by setting foot on the beach.

Bulgen told Cape Talk that “one officer told me I am stupid for having my child out in public because she could die,” and that the senior officer on the scene was not wearing a face mask.

Bulgen and his fiancée were taken separately to the police station. She was allegedly pushed into a police van while breastfeeding the toddler to calm her down.

South Africans initially rallied around President Cyril Ramaphosa in the early days of the country’s ongoing lockdown, but are now chafing at restrictions on movement — and overly zealous enforcement.

“We are not criminals. We did nothing wrong. And we were mistreated,” Bulgen said. He added that police prevented the couple from handing their toddler over to another relative during their confinement.

The social media accounts for Joe Biden released the new campaign ad which heckles President Trump for stating that he believes he has been “treated worse” than other U.S. presidents.

“Over 1 million cases of COVID-19. Almost 70,000 dead. What is upsetting President Trump? Tough questions from the press,” said Biden’s Twitter account, which included the video. “Cry me a river, Mr. President.”

Watch below:

The campaign ad includes Justin Timberlake’s 2002 hit song and is accompanied by edited video clips from President Trump’s Lincoln Memorial Fox town hall.

“I am greeted with a hostile press, the likes of which no president has ever seen,” the president can be heard saying in the video.

While Biden’s social media accounts insinuate that President Trump should be prioritizing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, the president has been busy conducting daily press briefings regarding his administration’s work in combating the Wuhan virus — and other daily updates — for months.

Meanwhile, many on the left — in Hollywood and in media — have been advocating for news organizations to cease the broadcasting of the daily sought-after briefings and block Americans’ ability to hear from the president on the issue.

The left-wing CNN and MSNBC have already cut away from President Trump’s briefings, refusing to air the full press conferences, with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow going as far as to argue that “all of us should stop broadcasting it, honestly.”

“It’s going to cost lives,” added Maddow of the president’s daily briefings on the Wuhan coronavirus.

The president visited a Honeywell manufacturing plant and spoke about the ongoing fight against the coronavirus.

Owner Jorge Rivas thanked the president and said he was very proud of what he was doing to help the country.

“I think we represent a lot of the Latino community that is very proud of the job that you are doing,” Rivas said. “And I think most of us, all of us Latinos are going to vote for you.”

Rivas said that he and his wife Betty appreciated his support.

His wife wore a denim Keep America Great vest and showed it off to the crowd before addressing them in Spanish and concluded by saying “Latinos Love Trump!”

President Trump thanked the owners and said that he had personally paid for the meals for 150 health care workers in an area health care center.

“They’re sending Donald Trump the bill,” Trump said. “I can’t write it off to the government, cause they wouldn’t like that, but we’re paying it.”

Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist of Imperial College, London resigned from his role as a senior scientific advisor to the British government Tuesday evening.

He became known as professor lockdown after his alarming data modelling predicted huge casualties for the populations of the United Kingdom and the United States unless they enacted severe curbs on individual freedoms to lock the nations down. While the moves were criticised by senior legal figures as approaching a police state, Professor Ferguson’s advice was nevertheless heeded by the government in March.

While Professor Ferguson frequently appeared in the media to defend his work and to tell the public not to break the lockdown rules, he was himself spectacularly breaking them in secret, according to a report in Britain’s Daily Telegraph, which claims the hard-line scientist was meeting his married lover.

The paper names Antonia Staats, a married mother, who was quarantined with her family at a separate address to the professor. Breaching the terms of the lockdown — as enforced by police — she travelled to Ferguson’s own home on at least two occasions, the paper claims.

Staats, who is identified as a “left-wing activist”, was said to be in an “open marriage”, The Telegraph claimed. Posts on Staat’s public Facebook page show strong left-wing themes, including paid activism as an employee of a campaign group, encouraging tactical voting in the last general election to oppose the Conservative party, and hard green activism.

Admitting his error, Professor Ferguson told the paper:

“I accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in Sage [the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]. “I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. “I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The Government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.”

The professor is not the first government scientific figure forced to resign after taking a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do posture to the general public. Breitbart London reported in April when the chief scientific advisor for Scotland resigned her position after ordering citizens to obey the lockdown measures while breaking them herself in public.

While Britons have been ordered to stay in their normal residences and not travel to their country homes in hope of enjoying a more comfortable and less cramped lockdown period, Dr Catherine Calderwood was photographed travelling to her country home. She received a police warning after being exposed in a national newspaper and resigned shortly afterwards.

Rubin advised against the placement of politics as one’s primary paradigm of experience.

“I think we have to try to separate every little [political] belief we have from how we are as humans,” Rubin urged. “I don’t want people to be permanently political. Right now — especially because of the coronavirus, I’m sure you’re seeing this on Twitter — the people that are obsessed with politics all the time, that can’t write about anything other than politics, or their whole worldview is consumed by politics, in many ways are the most miserable people, because politics is not a winning game.”

Rubin continued, “Politics is about controlling people, ultimately, and if you come from a … more libertarian perspective, where your goal is not to control everybody, I think there’s a way to be happier in life through that, because you want to free people, not control them. But if you’re if your goal is to control people — if you get off on controlling people — you will only be endlessly miserable.”

LISTEN:

“Conservatives seem to be much happier, right now, where leftists who are sort of drunk on steroid-laden secularism or something have nothing to believe in anymore,” stated Rubin. “So when the government’s run by a guy that they don’t like — or that they think is Hitler, as absurd as it is — they think the world is just coming to an end at all times. I don’t view politics as everything. It’s important, but it’s not everything.” Pollak asked why conservatives are more reserved than leftists in terms of political sermonizing. “Why is it that people on the left feel comfortable confronting people on the right about their views, but you almost never … have conservatives trying to get liberals to change their views in ordinary settings?” inquired Pollak. “Why is it okay for people on the left to do it, but people on the right feel like they’re overstepping a boundary if they do the same?” Rubin responded, “There’s a very clear answer to this … Broadly speaking, if you’re on the right, you sort of have some live and let live, and you realize that politics isn’t everything, and you kind of want to live your life and hope that other people will live their lives. The reason for that is because people on the right basically believe in individual rights, meaning that if you’re a conservative or you’re a libertarian, you basically believe that everyone in the country should have the same rights, regardless of skin color, race, the rest of it. That’s a bedrock principle.” Left-wing rejection of separation between realms of government and private life drives the ideology’s adherents to view all things through the lens of politics, explained Rubin. “On the left, it’s different. There is no bedrock principle other than, ‘Government should do this,'” Rubin remarked. Leftists are “always in that race to out-government themselves,” he added. Rubin went on, “Their business is everyone’s business, and everyone else’s business is their business,” noting that left-wing people are more likely to try to “jam their worldview down your throat” than those on the right. “Their whole existential being is wrapped up in how they feel, and I think that’s why they’re constantly pushing this stuff on people,” concluded Rubin, describing leftists’ worldview as myopically political. “It’s the totality of how they view the world. They don’t view it through some other lens.”

“Conservatives seem to be much happier, right now, where leftists who are sort of drunk on steroid-laden secularism or something have nothing to believe in anymore,” stated Rubin. “So when the government’s run by a guy that they don’t like — or that they think is Hitler, as absurd as it is — they think the world is just coming to an end at all times. I don’t view politics as everything. It’s important, but it’s not everything.” Pollak asked why conservatives are more reserved than leftists in terms of political sermonizing. “Why is it that people on the left feel comfortable confronting people on the right about their views, but you almost never … have conservatives trying to get liberals to change their views in ordinary settings?” inquired Pollak. “Why is it okay for people on the left to do it, but people on the right feel like they’re overstepping a boundary if they do the same?” Rubin responded, “There’s a very clear answer to this … Broadly speaking, if you’re on the right, you sort of have some live and let live, and you realize that politics isn’t everything, and you kind of want to live your life and hope that other people will live their lives. The reason for that is because people on the right basically believe in individual rights, meaning that if you’re a conservative or you’re a libertarian, you basically believe that everyone in the country should have the same rights, regardless of skin color, race, the rest of it. That’s a bedrock principle.” Left-wing rejection of separation between realms of government and private life drives the ideology’s adherents to view all things through the lens of politics, explained Rubin. “On the left, it’s different. There is no bedrock principle other than, ‘Government should do this,'” Rubin remarked. Leftists are “always in that race to out-government themselves,” he added. Rubin went on, “Their business is everyone’s business, and everyone else’s business is their business,” noting that left-wing people are more likely to try to “jam their worldview down your throat” than those on the right. “Their whole existential being is wrapped up in how they feel, and I think that’s why they’re constantly pushing this stuff on people,” concluded Rubin, describing leftists’ worldview as myopically political. “It’s the totality of how they view the world. They don’t view it through some other lens.”

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-05,Donald Trump Mocks 'Moonface' George Conway for Never Trump Ad,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday ridiculed a group of Never Trump Republicans who put together an ad criticizing his response to the Chinese coronavirus.

“I don’t know what Kellyanne did to her deranged loser of a husband, Moonface, but it must have been really bad,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his advisor Kellyanne Conway’s husband George Conway who is helping lead the “Lincoln Project” — a Never Trump Republican effort to get President Trump out of the White House in 2020.

The group created an ad called “Mourning in America” telling Americans that “more than 60,000 Americans have died from a deadly virus that Donald Trump ignored,” and that America is “weaker and sicker and poorer.”

The ad has over three million views on Twitter

Trump mocked the team for copying Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America” concept saying it was proof they had no imagination.

“You see, these loser types don’t care about 252 new Federal Judges, two great Supreme Court Justices, a rebuilt military, a protected 2nd Amendment, biggest EVER Tax & Regulation cuts, and much more,” he wrote, referring to his record as president.

Trump ridiculed other Republicans involved with the project as “losers,” such as former John Kasich adviser John Weaver, political strategist Rick Wilson who lost with a third party candidate Evan “McMuffin” McMullin, and former John McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt.

The president noted they were all part of the loser political class who lost to former President Barack Obama and were also beaten badly by his campaign in 2016.

“I didn’t use any of them because they don’t know how to win, and their so-called Lincoln Project is a disgrace to Honest Abe,” Trump said.

Trump suggested Abraham Lincoln himself would be proud of his Republican achievements as president.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-05,Pakistani Government Finds Mosques Violating Coronavirus Rules,"A report produced on Tuesday by the city government of Rawalpindi, in the Pakistani province of Punjab, found that most of the city’s 250 most sensitive mosques were ignoring guidelines provided for safe worship during the coronavirus pandemic.

The violations were especially widespread during Taraweeh, an additional prayer service observed during the Ramadan holiday.

Pakistan’s Dawn explained that mosques and imambargahs (halls where Shiite Muslim clerics can address women and children who are normally forbidden in mosques) were examined for their coronavirus vulnerability and rated on a scale of A, B, or C to determine how strict their pandemic precautions should be.

The regional police performed an audit and found that while masks and hand sanitizer were generally used as directed, many of the mosques allowed elderly people and children into risky, crowded areas where they were not supposed to go, and some did not provide clean floors for prayers.

Some of the riskiest mosques were not designed in a manner that facilitated good virus control measures, offering crowded and poorly-illuminated public spaces or inadequate space for worshipers to wait until they were admitted to the prayer halls.

Another security directive required metal detectors for all visitors, but 43 of the 250 mosques covered in the study did not provide them.

Pakistan has a running problem with hardline Muslim imams defying anti-pandemic measures and encouraging their followers to follow suit.

The New York Times noted in late April that “most clerics complied with the shutdown when it was announced, but some of the most influential ones immediately called on worshipers to attend Friday prayers in even greater numbers,” and those worshipers “attacked police officers who tried to get in their way.”

Clerical resistance to coronavirus precautions grew as Ramadan approached until a group of influential Muslim leaders wrote a letter demanding an exemption for mosques from the national pandemic lockdown, with the wrath of Allah and his faithful threatened against officials who refused to comply.

The Pakistani government submitted to this demand, allowing mosques to remain open for Ramadan provided they follow a list of 20 social distancing rules, which the Rawalpindi auditors said many of their mosques proceeded to ignore. A 21st rule that would have limited the size of congregations during Ramadan was rejected out of hand by the clerics, leading less fervent Pakistanis to wonder if Prime Minister Imran Khan had lost control of his government to the imams.

Writing at the Washington Post last week, Brookings Institution fellow Madiha Afzal anticipated precisely the indifferent level of compliance discovered in Rawalpindi. Afzal noted in advance what the police discovered during their audit: many of the 20 pandemic requirements were “impractical to follow” in the crowded mosques, and enforcement was nearly impossible with countless mosques holding five prayer sessions a day plus the extra Taraweeh prayers during Ramadan.

Afzal saw the Ramadan pandemic showdown as a power struggle between Prime Minister Khan, who “burnished his conservative image during his time in politics” and therefore “has more credibility with Islamists than most,” and fundamentalists who want Muslim law enforced by the secular government, while the ambitious and opportunistic Pakistani military looks for any sign that Khan’s position might be weakened by a clash with the religious establishment.

A prominent Pakistani religious leader named Abdul Aziz – a hardliner hard enough to have sent armed followers to make an unsuccessful stand against Pakistani troops when they raided his mosque in 2007 – told Al Jazeera that he and like-minded imams considered prayer more important than ever during the pandemic, particularly during Ramadan.

Aziz sneered at social distancing, finding the advice of doctors inferior to “the word of God” and saying that since he believes the coronavirus is a form of divine punishment, meted out “because we have filled the world with sins,” it would be sinful to compromise religious services in order to resist infection.

“We believe the people should not be made to fear things right now, they should have faith in God at this time, and to place their hope in him,” Aziz said. “If death is written for you, then it will come.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/05/pakistani-government-finds-mosques-routinely-violating-coronavirus-rules/

['Robert Kraychik'],2020-05-05,Gordon Chang: Trump Should Use Trading with the Enemy Act to Block Corporate Business with China,"Daily Beast columnist and The Great U.S.-China Tech War author Gordon Chang said President Donald Trump should use the Trading With The Enemy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to block U.S.-based multinational corporations from doing business with China, offering his remarks on Monday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward.

Hayward highlighted Bill Gates’ praise of the Chinese Communist Party’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak as emblematic of “globalist billionaires” — and the world’s most-capitalized technology companies’ — alignment with China.

“We’ve gotten some sobering demonstrations over the past couple of weeks that our own multinational billionaire class is not necessarily on our side,” he noted. “More and more of these globalist tycoons in the United States and Australia and Europe are announcing [or] kind of quietly walking over to China’s side of this debate and at least saying we need to back off, that we’re never going to get anywhere by trying to investigate the coronavirus or blame them for it, and we should instead work with [China] in order to address the remains of the global pandemic. Is that surprising? Is there anything we can do about discovering that so much of our monied elite to lead is really more on China’s side than on ours?”

Chang replied, “It’s not surprising. Money is money. Business is business. I think that when we look at this, we’ve got to understand that we shouldn’t expect loyalty from multinationals. It’ll be nice to get it but that’s not the way business works. What we can do and what would be very effective is for President Trump to use his power under the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and just prevent the monied class from doing things which make them disloyal.”

LISTEN:

Chang added, “What we have to do is to find American national security and enforce it. Once we do that, business will get in line, because our market is more important than China’s market, especially with China on the way that it is now. So this is really up to us and we can do this.”

Hayward asked about China’s use of “sharp power” beyond its borders, referring to the one-party state’s procurement of cultural, political, and social leverage in the West by developing financial relationships with leaders within the three spheres.

“Maybe it’s time for us to get into the sharp power arms race,” considered Hayward. “China uses sharp power, which is economic leverage to compel foreign companies to follow their speech codes and toe the political line coming out of Beijing. We have vastly more financial power than they do, but we don’t use it like they do — ever — and in fact, our own political class would probably turn on any American leader who suggested doing this sort of thing that the Chinese government does repeatedly. We can’t beat them if we don’t start playing the sharp power game, can we?”

Chang quipped, “You should be national security advisor, John. That’s absolutely right. This is what we need to do. We need to use all the elements of our power. We haven’t been doing that. We’ve had a series of presidents who’ve been much more interested in protecting the interest of China’s communists than they are about the American worker. That has to stop. That is stopping with President Trump, who has decided he’s going to actually support the American worker over China’s communists.”

Chang added, “We need to push President Trump further, because he does have the power to make it really uncomfortable for people who believe more in communism than they do in democracy. Many of those people, unfortunately, are Americans.”

Mansour stated, “We shouldn’t expect loyalty from our multinationals. Their focus is on their bottom line, but we can use our policies to actually force them to comply… Our government can exert power to basically protect our national interests. I’m also thinking that we should be demanding certain things from these multinationals in terms of complying with human rights. Any company that is making products in China using slave labor or profiting from it should be held to account.”

Chang responded, “Absolutely, Rebecca. What we have is, for instance, Uyghurs who are being forced from their homeland to work in factories far from where they live. This is a crime against humanity. This is forced labor. This is Third Reich-type stuff.”

“First of all, the American people just need to hold these companies to account, and we know their names,” added Chang. “They’re big consumer companies. Also, it’s up to President Trump to use his powers to say, ‘No, this is going to be absolutely illegal. You’re not going to do this.’ It’s up to the President of the United States to change the incentives [and] to change the boundaries under which these companies act. These companies will act in the most disgusting, horrific manner possible. We just need to make sure they cannot do that.”

Chang concluded by maintaining his call for China to pay reparations to the U.S. over its negligence related to the coronavirus outbreak.

“As of today, there’s about 69,000 Americans who have died of coronavirus,” remarked Chang. “China deliberately spread the disease beyond its borders. Beijing killed 69,000 Americans and counting.”

['John Hayward'],2020-05-05,Pakistan’s Prime Minister Wants Coronavirus Bailouts for Poor Countries,"Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday called upon wealthy nations to finance a more extensive rescue package for developing economies in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Unfortunately, wealthy nations are grappling with trillion-dollar pandemic meltdowns of their own.

Khan is working with like-minded leaders to assemble a coalition at the United Nations to “commence consultations for proposing a comprehensive solution to the debt challenges of developing countries against the backdrop of Covid-19,” as Pakistan’s Dawn put it. His call for a bigger bailout plan than anything proposed to date was made during a phone conversation with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali.

“Global recession is imminent,” Khan told Ali, in a manner that suggested his intended audience was much broader than the prime minister of Ethiopia. “Developing countries would need a combination of additional measures to meet urgent financial requirements, sustain growth, strengthen fragile health systems as well as to save lives and provide social protection to those below the poverty line.”

Stimulus programs, loans, and debt relief for the underdeveloped world are naturally major topics of discussion as the pandemic grinds on. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are facing what the Wall Street Journal described as a “deluge of aid requests” from emerging markets. Appeals for a massive bailout have been made to the G20 assembly of the world’s largest economies as well.

Individual nations such as the United States, the European powers, and Japan have announced trillion-dollar global stimulus plans. As of Monday, over $10 trillion in bailouts were on the table to combat a global financial crisis the IMF compared to the Great Depression. Major industries that link the developed and developing world, notably including the airlines, are teetering on the brink of collapse. The world’s economic powerhouses have all taken massive hits from the coronavirus themselves, so their ability to protect and nourish poor economies is limited.

Largely absent in these bailout tallies is the country that should be compensating the world for the pandemic it unleashed, Communist China. The New York Times noted last month that while the rest of the world is “opening its wallet to fight the effects of the coronavirus outbreak,” the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is “holding back” on both aid to developing nations and domestic bailouts.

To date, the CCP has been unmoved by even the most polite suggestions that it could win all sorts of public relations credit for itself by sending some no-strings-attached aid to developing nations. Deeply paranoid about the dangers of a global backlash against it, the CCP seems more interested in insulting and bullying every nation that asks tough questions about the origins of the coronavirus than winning brownie points by handing out financial aid.

Beijing has a habit of trumpeting its “medical aid” to countries ravaged by the Wuhan virus – even when the “aid” is actually sold at retail prices and proves to contain equipment of exceptionally shoddy quality – but it seems wary of getting on the hook for any significant economic assistance, perhaps because its own economy is in much worse shape than the CCP wants to admit, and it is reluctant to provide any form of assistance that could be interpreted as an admission of liability for the pandemic.

London School of Economics professors Maitreesh Ghatak, Xavier Jaravel, and Jonathan Weigal wrote at the New York Times in late April to warn that over $100 billion in capital has fled emerging markets since the beginning of 2020, and the coronavirus bomb is still ticking in areas like sub-Saharan Africa.

Many developing countries were already facing severe debt crises before the pandemic – along with some much more developed nations such as Turkey – so they have no way to marshal emergency spending for medical equipment and coronavirus-related economic relief. More loans, even at very reasonable disaster rates, would only increase their crushing debt burdens, making investors even less likely to take a gamble on them once the pandemic recedes.

Cautioning that the developed world cannot sustain the shocks from a string of insolvencies and economic collapses in developing nations, the professors recommended a new “Marshall Plan” to “transfer resources immediately to the developing world on a massive scale,” which they dubbed the “Global Solidarity Fund.”

This plan may face the same problem Pakistani Prime Minister Khan and his alliance are likely to encounter at the United Nations: nobody has one percent of GDP to spare and there will be few takers for a bailout scheme that asks nothing more of China than it does of Germany or even virus-ravaged Italy.

As other bailout proponents have noted, even attractively priced loans are tough sells to teetering, overextended developing economies, but without even the faintest promise of repayment, anything else is difficult to ask from developed countries grappling with their own coronavirus economic meltdowns.

The American people are looking at unemployment and GDP reports that look like something out of a feverish nightmare and watching major industries wobble on the edge of the bankruptcy void; in two months we went from an economy performing beyond expectations to a world in which the prosperity of 2019 seems like a thousand years ago, and we may need to accept that certain goods and services we took for granted on New Year’s Eve will simply cease to exist. Millions of people went from ambitious workers looking forward to career growth in a red-hot labor market to fearfully wondering if their jobs will ever come back.

From the perspective of macroeconomics, it’s true that if the coronavirus pushes the dominoes of insolvent Third World economies into a cascade collapse, the ensuing humanitarian calamity will horrify the compassionate people of the West and the fiscal shockwave will be felt on Main Street. The Chinese Communist Party’s irresponsible lies and lust for power have robbed those compassionate people of their ability to do much about it.

In the face of staggering unemployment reports like the one coming our way in America on Friday, there will be little enthusiasm for donating a percentage of our GDP to Pakistan or Africa, especially to countries that are already deeply in hock to China’s Belt and Road program of debt colonialism. Beijing should be expected to take care of its own colonial possessions. May it cost them every last coin in their treasuries, and in the secret offshore accounts of Xi Jinping and the rest of the Communist Party hierarchy.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/05/hayward-pakistans-prime-minister-wants-coronavirus-bailouts-poor-countries/

As of Monday, over $10 trillion in bailouts were on the table to combat a global financial crisis the IMF compared to the Great Depression. Major industries that link the developed and developing world, notably including the airlines, are teetering on the brink of collapse. The world’s economic powerhouses have all taken massive hits from the coronavirus themselves, so their ability to protect and nourish poor economies is limited.

Largely absent in these bailout tallies is the country that should be compensating the world for the pandemic it unleashed, Communist China. The New York Times noted last month that while the rest of the world is “opening its wallet to fight the effects of the coronavirus outbreak,” the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is “holding back” on both aid to developing nations and domestic bailouts.

To date, the CCP has been unmoved by even the most polite suggestions that it could win all sorts of public relations credit for itself by sending some no-strings-attached aid to developing nations. Deeply paranoid about the dangers of a global backlash against it, the CCP seems more interested in insulting and bullying every nation that asks tough questions about the origins of the coronavirus than winning brownie points by handing out financial aid.

Beijing has a habit of trumpeting its “medical aid” to countries ravaged by the Wuhan virus – even when the “aid” is actually sold at retail prices and proves to contain equipment of exceptionally shoddy quality – but it seems wary of getting on the hook for any significant economic assistance, perhaps because its own economy is in much worse shape than the CCP wants to admit, and it is reluctant to provide any form of assistance that could be interpreted as an admission of liability for the pandemic.

London School of Economics professors Maitreesh Ghatak, Xavier Jaravel, and Jonathan Weigal wrote at the New York Times in late April to warn that over $100 billion in capital has fled emerging markets since the beginning of 2020, and the coronavirus bomb is still ticking in areas like sub-Saharan Africa.

Many developing countries were already facing severe debt crises before the pandemic – along with some much more developed nations such as Turkey – so they have no way to marshal emergency spending for medical equipment and coronavirus-related economic relief. More loans, even at very reasonable disaster rates, would only increase their crushing debt burdens, making investors even less likely to take a gamble on them once the pandemic recedes.

Cautioning that the developed world cannot sustain the shocks from a string of insolvencies and economic collapses in developing nations, the professors recommended a new “Marshall Plan” to “transfer resources immediately to the developing world on a massive scale,” which they dubbed the “Global Solidarity Fund.”

This plan may face the same problem Pakistani Prime Minister Khan and his alliance are likely to encounter at the United Nations: nobody has one percent of GDP to spare and there will be few takers for a bailout scheme that asks nothing more of China than it does of Germany or even virus-ravaged Italy.

As other bailout proponents have noted, even attractively priced loans are tough sells to teetering, overextended developing economies, but without even the faintest promise of repayment, anything else is difficult to ask from developed countries grappling with their own coronavirus economic meltdowns.

The American people are looking at unemployment and GDP reports that look like something out of a feverish nightmare and watching major industries wobble on the edge of the bankruptcy void; in two months we went from an economy performing beyond expectations to a world in which the prosperity of 2019 seems like a thousand years ago, and we may need to accept that certain goods and services we took for granted on New Year’s Eve will simply cease to exist. Millions of people went from ambitious workers looking forward to career growth in a red-hot labor market to fearfully wondering if their jobs will ever come back.

From the perspective of macroeconomics, it’s true that if the coronavirus pushes the dominoes of insolvent Third World economies into a cascade collapse, the ensuing humanitarian calamity will horrify the compassionate people of the West and the fiscal shockwave will be felt on Main Street. The Chinese Communist Party’s irresponsible lies and lust for power have robbed those compassionate people of their ability to do much about it.

In the face of staggering unemployment reports like the one coming our way in America on Friday, there will be little enthusiasm for donating a percentage of our GDP to Pakistan or Africa, especially to countries that are already deeply in hock to China’s Belt and Road program of debt colonialism. Beijing should be expected to take care of its own colonial possessions. May it cost them every last coin in their treasuries, and in the secret offshore accounts of Xi Jinping and the rest of the Communist Party hierarchy.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/05/hayward-pakistans-prime-minister-wants-coronavirus-bailouts-poor-countries/#disqus_thread
['Ben Kew'],2020-05-05,Venezuela: Maduro Abducts Two Americans Following Failed ‘Coup’,"Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro announced on Monday that authorities had abducted two American citizens on charges of working with an alleged U.S. military veteran who claimed to carry out a failed coup against his socialist regime.

In an address on state television, Maduro brandished passports allegedly belonging to Airan Berry and Luke Denman, who he accused of playing “Rambo” in a failed attack intended to remove him from power.

“We have physical and material evidence that the group trained on Colombian territory,” he declared. “It has been stated that the adviser to the United States showed evidence of expedition to assault the country and kill me.”

He did not specify who the “adviser” to the American government was.

According to Maduro, the pair were working with Jordan Goudreau, a man claiming to be an American military veteran who runs the Florida-based security company Silvercorp USA. They were abducted on Monday alongside 11 other men, one day after eight men were killed and two others detained in an alleged failed speedboat incursion into Venezuelan territory.

Speaking to the Associated Press, Goudreau confirmed that the two men were part of a mission named Operation Gideon, where they hoped to “liberate” Venezuela from Maduro’s leadership, who has led the once-thriving South American country into one of the world’s most serious economic and humanitarian crises. He is now working to try and get his colleagues released from custody.

“I’ve tried to engage everybody I know at every level,” said Goudreau. “Nobody’s returning my calls, It’s a nightmare.”

Sources close to or within the Venezuelan security forces told Reuters that the two men were arrested and are currently in the custody of Venezuelan military intelligence.

“While the people are in quarantine and at peace, terrorists were planning an attacking against our country. I denounce this before the Non-Aligned Movement,” Maduro continued, in reference to the group of far-left governments opposed to the United States. “Venezuela is standing up defeating the pandemic and terrorism.”

Maduro went on to claim that the plotters were working on behalf of Colombia, the U.S. government, and the nation’s legitimate president, Juan Guaidó, as part of an attempt to oust him from office. Representatives for Guaidó insisted in a statement Monday that they “have no relationship with or responsibility for the actions of the company Silvercorp,” while demanding that the human rights of detainees were respected.

Responding to the incident on Tuesday, President Donald Trump insisted it has “nothing to do with our government.”

“We’ll find out,” he told reporters. “We just heard about it.”

['Pam Key'],2020-05-05,"Whitmer on Biden Allegations: ‘Under These Circumstances’ with 70,000 Dead, We Need Joe","Tuesday on NBC’s “Today,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) dismissed the sexual assault allegations against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, saying “under these circumstances” due to the coronavirus pandemic Biden will be a good president.

Host Craig Melvin asked, “Your name, of course, continues to come upon this shortlist for Joe Biden. As you know, in the past week, the former vice president has been accused of sexual assault. He’s vehemently denied the allegation himself. You are a Biden supporter, one of his earlier backers. I know you are also a sexual assault survivor as well is there anything you want to add to the conversation, Governor Whitmer, that’s emerged over the past few days?”

Whitmer said, “I’ll just say you know I’ve read a lot about allegations. I’ve talked with Joe Biden. I am confident he is who he says he is. I do believe that women should be given space, and they should be listened to, but I also know it’s incumbent we vet thoroughly. In this moment, I think under these circumstances and the conversations that I’ve had with the vice president, I am confident he is who he says he is, and I believe him. I believe he’ll be a good president for the United States of America. Beyond that, you know, I don’t know there’s much more I can add. I simply know that we as a country should be very cognizant of the fact that 70,000 people—more than 70,000 people have died. We have lost the equivalent of a 9/11, and they anticipate that number daily between now and the end of the month. This is a crisis where 30 million people are unemployed in our country. Everything I’m doing is focused on saving lives in the state of Michigan. We need leaders are going to be focused on data and doing the right thing.”

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-05,Pressley: Biden Can Address Reade Allegations and Defeat ‘Occupant of the White House’,"Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) in an op-ed on Monday lamented the lack of justice for survivors of sexual assault but added that she rejects the “false choice that my party and our nominee [Joe Biden] can’t address the allegations at hand and defeat the occupant of the White House.”

“I’m here for an uncomfortable conversation,” the “Squad” member wrote in an op-ed demonstratively spurred by Joe Biden (D) facing accusations of sexual assault from former Senate staffer Tara Reade:

An open letter: It’s 2020 and We Still Don’t Know What Survivor Justice Looks Like in Publichttps://t.co/DzhiB1ydqg pic.twitter.com/tC3TNrlg5z — Ayanna Pressley (@AyannaPressley) May 4, 2020

It is a “necessary” conversation, Pressley said, adding, “I am a survivor. I am an elected official. I am not new to watching survivors bare their souls, and I am not new to being offered false choices in politics.”

The Massachusetts lawmaker said the Biden-Reade saga prompts an “urgent and visceral question.”

“What does an authentic path towards healing and justice look like for survivors in America?” she asked.

She admitted that there is no clear answer or path and stressed the importance of listening to survivors while slamming her Republican colleagues. They, she claimed, “slammed doors in the faces of survivors during the Kavanaugh hearings, and are spending millions to weaponize these allegations against Democratic women in purple states, do not care at all about survivor justice.”

Despite the sharp demonization of her Republican colleagues, Pressley essentially walked the line herself, attempting to reconcile her call for survivor justice with her innate desire to defeat the “occupant of the White House.”

She wrote in part:

Our assumptions and our starting points for these conversations have to change, and the allegations against Joe Biden are no exception. Listening to the stories of those who step forward is the baseline. We say “believe survivors” because, for nearly all of history, the experiences of survivors have been dismissed and derided by a society steeped in misogyny and hatred. We advocate that we begin with assumptions of credibility and move to due process and reconciliation. … We are in the throes of an election of the greatest consequence — one that will determine if core rights and tenets of democracy survive in this nation. The stakes cannot be overstated. But I have no patience for any person who tells me that is a reason to lower my voice. I reject the false choice that my party and our nominee can’t address the allegations at hand and defeat the occupant of the White House. [emphasis added]

Pressley accused Republicans of “using anything they can to undermine the Democratic nominee” and asked Biden and his campaign to “give a response that models the empathy, diligence, and acknowledgement of broken systems that this conversation demands.”

“I’m asking for true partnership with survivors and advocates, and for policy commitments that get us closer as a nation to reconciling our history of structural violence and oppression,” she said.

“There are survivors in every corner of this nation who can tell you what a more just America would look like. I, for one, will be listening,” she concluded.

Her piece earned praise from fellow “Squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who called it “powerful”:

“I reject the false choice that my party and our nominee can’t address the allegations at hand and defeat the occupant of the White House.” This OpEd from @AyannaPressley is powerful, her voice/advocacy offer a path for survivor justice and reconciliation.

Biden recently responded to Reade, who claimed that the former senator sexually assaulted her during her time as a staffer in his Senate office in the early 1990s. The Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee denied the claim in a lengthy statement last week, stating quite plainly that “this never happened.”

“I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened and it didn’t. It never happened,” Biden said during last week’s appearance on Morning Joe.

“I don’t remember any type of complaint she may have made,” he continued. “It was 27 years ago. And I don’t remember, nor does anyone else that I’m aware of. The fact is that I don’t remember. I don’t remember any complaint ever having been made.”

The Biden campaign has reportedly circulated talking points for Democrat allies, detailing how to better address the allegations.

“Biden believes that all women have the right to be heard and to have their claims thoroughly reviewed,” the talking points read, as detailed by BuzzFeed. “In this case, a thorough review by the New York Times has led to the truth: this incident did not happen.”

The talking points mention Biden’s decades in public life and adds, “There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him — ever.”

The talking points also contend that “this alleged conduct would have been so wildly out of character for Joe Biden.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is among those who have mimicked the campaign’s talking points, stating that she, a self-described feminist, has read a lot about the current allegation. However, she said she knows Biden and has determined that she is “very comfortable” with “who he says he is.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/ayanna-pressley-biden-democrats-can-address-reade-allegations-and-defeat-the-occupant-of-the-white-house/

Given the circumstances, this is the best course of action for the safety of students, educators, and staff. https://t.co/0mo9VUVq29 pic.twitter.com/qKgVcMP4uh — Governor Ned Lamont (@GovNedLamont) May 5, 2020

The governor said in a statement:

I know how important it is for so many students and teachers to finish out the school year, and I was holding out hope – particularly for high school seniors – that we’d at least be able to complete the final few weeks, but given the current circumstances and to protect everyone’s safety, it has become clear that it’s just not possible. I want to thank the many educators across our state who have stepped up to provide remote learning during this time, as well as the many staff members who’ve been putting thousands of meals together for students each and every day.

According to the executive order, schools will continue to provide distance learning and meals to children who received breakfast and lunch in school.

The announcement states Connecticut’s public schools “have served more than four million meals to students” during the coronavirus crisis.

“A total of 130 school districts are currently serving meals at 458 locations statewide,” it read.

Lamont ordered cancellation of in-person classes on March 17, and then extended the order twice, with the latest extension date being May 20.

“The difficult decision to cancel classes for the remainder of the year is based on the health and safety of our students, their families, and our Connecticut communities,” Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona also said in the statement.

The Connecticut Education Association (CEA), the largest union representing the state’s public school teachers, released a statement in support of Lamont’s decision:

CEA applauds Governor Lamont for listening to public health experts in his decision to close schools for the remainder of this school year. Making the safety and health of students and staff the top priority will help save lives and prevent the further spread of COVID-19.

“We understand the emotion and sadness regarding closing schools and missing certain milestones and celebrations, but at this time, everyone’s top priority must be to protect the health of students and staff, and to prevent the spread of the coronavirus,” said CEA President Jeff Leake.

“This crisis is not over,” Leake added:

[E]xperts say a resurgence of the virus could occur this fall. We must use the next few months to ensure that safety procedures and protocols are in place before students, teachers, and staff re-enter the classrooms. … These are unprecedented times, and they call for unprecedented responses. It is critical that the state and municipalities meet their responsibility to fund the resources students need when they return to the classroom—teachers, counselors, psychologists and strong academic programs.

Cardona added his department is “constantly improving access to high-quality materials and connectivity for our students.”

“Districts are working hard to find creative ways to celebrate the success of our seniors, as well as students who are transitioning from fifth and eighth grade,” he said, stating the panel working to reopen Connecticut is working on plans for summer school.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/connecticut-governor-closes-schools-for-remainder-of-academic-year/

['Frances Martel'],2020-05-05,China: Pompeo Betrayed Christianity with Wuhan Lab Remarks,"China’s state-run Global Times newspaper accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday of “betray[ing] Christianity” and bringing “shame to the evangelical Christians” of America for saying that “enormous evidence” exists linking the current pandemic to a biological laboratory in Wuhan, where it originated.

The first cases of Chinese coronavirus are known to have occurred in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million. Chinese officials initially stated that the virus originated in a “wet market,” where anyone can sell animal carcasses for consumption, and shut the market down in early January. Police “disinfected” the market, making it impossible for scientists to search for samples of the virus to study.

Now, China denies that the virus originated there, despite the fact that all earliest known cases were documented in Wuhan. Instead, Chinese officials have speculated that the virus originated in a U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland, offering no evidence to corroborate this claim. More recently – and in the anti-Pompeo editorial on Tuesday – Chinese media have begun floating the idea that some link exists between the Chinese coronavirus and diseases related to the use of electronic cigarettes in the United States.

The Global Times column on Tuesday was a response to Pompeo stating in an interview on Sunday that there was “enormous evidence” linking the Wuhan Institute of Virology to the pandemic.

“We’ve said from the beginning that this was a virus that originated in Wuhan, China. We took a lot of grief for that from the outset. But I think the whole world can see now,” Pompeo said. “Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”

Pompeo concluded that, while not complete, investigations appear to show “there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”

The Global Times responded by attacking Pompeo’s religion in an editorial titled “Pompeo Betrays Christianity with Lies.”

“It is generally believed that Pompeo is a devout evangelical Christian. Sometimes he even ‘preaches’ at diplomatic occasions, for which he was criticized,” the newspaper claimed, without providing examples of what sort of remarks it was referring to. “It seems that he does not care about being a subject of controversy. Nonetheless, his lying for political purposes is contrary to his label as a so-called ‘devout Christian.'”

“It is widely known that Christian doctrine opposes lying – it’s a sin. A false witness shall not go unpunished. And he that utters lies shall perish,” the editorial claims, placing an emphasis on retribution and punishment that is largely absent from the four Gospels that contain Jesus’s teachings and failing to mention the Christian promise of mercy and forgiveness.

“Pompeo has been lying. He has brought shame to the evangelical Christians in the US, misusing their trust in the Republican party. He is no doubt a degenerate politician and despicable from the perspective of religion,” the article asserted.

The editorial claimed Pompeo “lied” in his remarks because he “hates socialist China and, in particular, cannot accept China’s rise. He hence launched a propaganda campaign to ruin China’s image.” It goes on to make a series of outrageous statements suggesting that the virus originated in the United States.

“For example, some Chinese, Japanese and even Americans have long suspected that some COVID-19 patients turned up when the US seasonal flu began last winter. There are even some reports that the lipoid pneumonia cases from vaping e-cigarettes observed in the US last year were actually the COVID-19 cases,” the Global Times claimed, without offering any examples of these alleged individuals who have entertained the theory.

The Global Times article attacking Pompeo’s religion is a significant escalation from Chinese state media’s initial response to his comments, which was merely to call them a “bluff” and urge Pompeo to share the evidence that he claimed existed. It also follows a documented escalation in persecution of Christians within China during the pandemic, according to dissidents and Christians in the country.

China is one of the worst most repressive nations and allows only five legal religions to operate in the country: Christianity, Catholicism (separate from “Christianity”), Taoism, Buddhism, and Islam. China forces the clergy of all religions to use their positions to promote the Communist Party, despite the fact that the Party is by definition atheist. Avoiding government propaganda, many Christians in China opt instead for group prayers at home, typically called the “house church” system, which is illegal.

Persecution of “house churches,” many led by Evangelicals, has escalated during the outbreak. Multiple incidents of mass arrests of Christians for praying together have occurred. China has also targeted the legal “Three-Self Patriotic Church,” bulldozing legal church buildings and removing crosses. Witnesses to the incident say Chinese police bulldozed a church on Easter Sunday this year, the holiest day in the Christian calendar. Police also arrested Christians using online video services to pray together on the holiday.

['Ben Kew'],2020-05-05,Vladimir Putin Awards Kim Jong-un World War II Medal,"Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un a commemorative war medal to mark the 75th anniversary of the victory of Britain, Russia, and other allied forces over Nazi Germany in World War II, the Russian embassy in Pyongyang announced on Tuesday.

In its statement, the embassy said that it was presenting the world’s most repressive communist tyrant with the award for his regime’s preservation of the memory of Soviet soldiers who were buried on North Korean territory:

In accordance with the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation and the Chairman of the State Council of the DPRK, Kim Jong-un has been awarded the jubilee medal for the “75th Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945,” for his great personal contribution to preserving the memory of Soviet citizens who died and were buried on the territory of the DPRK [North Korea] and for the concern for the safety of burial places and memorials of Soviet soldiers in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Kim Jong-un did not attend the ceremony. Foreign Minister Ri Son-Gwon was presented with the award by the Russian ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matesgora.

It is not clear if the ceremony would typically be of the importance to attract Kim’s presence. His absence follows weeks of speculation regarding his health that recently culminated with him allegedly making a public appearance last week.

“[Ri and Matesgora] held a brief conversation during which they confirmed the spirit of continuing active efforts to consistently implement the agreements reached by the leaders of the two countries in Vladivostok in April 2019, aimed at further developing and strengthening multifaceted Russian-Korean cooperation,” the statement continued.

Photos of the meeting in Pyongyang showed all those in attendance wearing sanitary masks as a safeguard against the Chinese coronavirus, despite the fact that North Korea has yet to officially report a single case of the disease. Experts widely believe the country has been badly hit by the pandemic.

Kim Jong-un was scheduled to visit Moscow on May 9 to attend a military parade marking the anniversary of the victory, but the meeting and parade were postponed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Russia remains North Korea’s most steadfast ally, behind communist China, with Putin and Kremlin officials forging close diplomatic ties and opposing all attempts to isolate the Kim regime from the international community. Last year, Kim made his first official meeting with Putin in the Siberian city of Vladivostok. The Russian leader described the encounter as a “very wonderful time,” although nothing substantial with regard to plans to denuclearize the Korean peninsula was agreed at the time, or since it took place.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-05,"Chinese Coronavirus 'Charity' Triggering Disgust, Frustration in Zimbabwe","Zimbabweans have started to voice suspicion of the several coronavirus aid packages China has sent their country in recent weeks, accusing Beijing of using the aid to generate favorable publicity amid a global backlash against the country, Radio France Internationale (RFI) reported on Monday.

Many nations have criticized China for covering up its initial outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus late last year, greatly contributing to its subsequent spread out of the country to the rest of the world. The outbreak has since grown into a full-fledged pandemic responsible for 3,618,325 infections and 253,381 deaths worldwide.

Zimbabwe is connected to China through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a system of infrastructure development China uses across Africa and other parts of the world to establish regional influence. The BRI projects are advertised as lucrative endeavors for host countries when, in reality, they place the developing nations further into debt and force their dependency on China. In the past, China’s aid packages to Zimbabwe have typically been related to this BRI connection.

More recently, China has been donating medical aid – such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing kits – as well as large sums of money to Zimbabwe in an outward attempt to help the country combat the coronavirus pandemic. As RFI reported this week, China paid for an upgrade worth $500,000 to the capital’s main coronavirus treatment center. China has employed this new trend of “coronavirus diplomacy,” as critics refer to it, to generate positive publicity for itself, not only in Zimbabwe and Africa, but around the world.

Recently, Zimbabweans have increasingly expressed weariness of China’s self-proclaimed generosity in sending these aid packages, meant to contain a virus that China helped spread around the world.

“It may well be expending more energy on profiling these contributions in the face of bad press relating to its responsibilities around managing and communicating around the initial stages of the [coronavirus] pandemic,” Piers Pigou, a southern Africa consultant with the International Crisis Group, told RFI.

In April, Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo urged citizens not to blame a particular group of people for the origin of the coronavirus, in an obvious attempt to quell criticism of China, RFI reports.

On April 23, Zhao Baogang, the deputy ambassador of China to Zimbabwe, tweeted “[S]anctions harm Zim[babwe] more than COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus].”

In response, influential Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinono tweeted back, “You think that Zimbabweans are so foolish that they would buy into your pathetic explanations when the whole world knows what is going on?”

“Corruption, Looting, and Chinese pillaging harm Zimbabwe more than anything else,” Chinono added.

“If companies like Huawei were paying taxes, Zimbabwe would not need donations,” he said, referring to a 2014 investment agreement between Huawei and Zimbabwe exempting the Chinese telecom giant from paying taxes in the country.

Last month, Zimbabwean lawyer Alex Magaisa questioned the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe’s decision to donate coronavirus medical aid to a foundation run by Zimbabwe’s first lady, Auxillia Mnangagwa, instead of Zimbabwe’s Health Ministry, New Zimbabwe reports.

Magaisa argued that giving urgently needed coronavirus material – including 50,000 masks, 510 protective suits, and 1,000 goggles – to Mnangagwa instead of directly to medical facilities created unnecessary bureaucracy. Magaisa says he believes the donation was a political move to appease President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

“Now they come through a non-state actor [the foundation] when the state entities exist … We can see through the veil.

Asked on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel to respond to a Wall Street Journal article that claimed the Trump administration will not be taking action against China if China abides by the terms of the phase one trade agreement reached earlier this year, Gidley said that while he had not seen the article, he does not believe that is accurate.

“I haven’t seen the article but I have to say just on its face what you’re telling me it sounds inaccurate,” Gidley told host Alex Marlow. “You’ve heard what the president has been saying about China. We’ve been tougher on China with the tariffs he put in place, with the deals he’s made, he actually was eyes wide open on China from day one. If you actually go back and look at his clips from Oprah in the 80s he’s saying the same thing about China eating our lunch while other people on the other side kind of ignore China and parrot their talking points. I saw a disgusting article in Politico yesterday where they were talking about how China came out unscathed in this and America is kind of the bad guy. I laughed at the byline because I can’t remember the author’s name but the author was the editor in chief for China content—I though ‘for China content,’ yeah that’s exactly right. That’s exactly what China wants him to do.”

The Wall Street Journal article used public comments from a number of Trump officials to infer that the president “won’t seek to punish China economically if Beijing abides by trade commitments made earlier this year.”

The two people the Wall Street Journal quoted were Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mnuchin’s quote in the article does not even mention any kind of actions related to holding China accountable for coronavirus in the future. He just describes the unrelated effort to make China stick to the trade deal. “I have every reason to expect that they honor this agreement,” Mnuchin said in a Fox Business interview that was quoted by the Journal. Mnuchin added that China not honoring the trade deal would lead to “very significant consequences in the relationship and in the global economy as to how people would do business with them.”

Mnuchin is not quoted as saying anything about future efforts to hold the Chinese accountable for this crisis.

As it relates to the Treasury Department, though, this past weekend on Breitbart News Saturday the department’s spokeswoman, Monica Crowley, said that decisions on holding China accountable would become clearer after the public health and economic crisis in the United States subsides.

“I’m not going to get in front of the president or treasury secretary on any kind of policy discussions or decisions,” Crowley said then. “I know that the administration’s sole focus at the moment is making sure that the American people are safe, and that their well being is intact, and that they are kept safe and healthy, and that the other priority, of course, is the economic priorities in getting America stood up again and getting the economy roaring as only Donald Trump can do. I mean, he did it once, and he’s going to be asked to stand up and do it again within the space of four years, and he can do it because he’s got the pro-growth and economic policies that delivered it the first time around. After this, we will see what considerations are made with regard to making China accountable, and we will see where those discussions take us policy-wise.”

Pottinger, on the other hand, is quoted in the Journal article as having said during an academic conference regarding China: “The U.S. isn’t looking at punitive measures here.”

But Pottinger’s full remarks on China at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia paint a much different story than that short quote the Wall Street Journal plucked out. He berated China for silencing journalists and whistleblower doctors, he lambasted the Communist regime for Tiananmen Square, and he ripped into Beijing for denying its people freedoms—nowhere near an apologist view when it comes to China. Pottinger said in the speech:

Let me break his rule against discussing ‘isms’ to ask whether China today would benefit from a little less nationalism and a little more populism. Democratic populism is less about left versus right than top versus bottom. It’s about reminding a few that they need the consent of many to govern. When a privileged few grow too remote and self-interested, populism is what pulls them back or pitches them overboard. It has a kinetic energy. It fueled the Brexit vote of 2015 and President Trump’s election in 2016. It moved the founder of your university to pen a declaration of independence in 1776. It is an admonition to the powerful of this country to remember who they’re supposed to work for: America first.

That revolutionary tone does not seem to be much of a push to let China off the hook, and he may have just been saying that the United States is not looking at “punitive measures” because he does not want to frame administration action as “punitive.”

As such, during his Monday appearance on Breitbart News Daily, Gidley told Marlow that the president does intend to hold China accountable for its actions, but he did not provide specific planned actions yet.

“I can tell you the president–how that’s going to look and how that’s going to manifest I’m not going to get into on this show,” Gidley said. “But the president knows what’s going on here. He wants to make sure the American people are safe. He wants to make sure we can still work with nations. But the world knows now what we have been saying is fact, and China is culpable in this, and they weren’t giving us the good information. If you’re going to defeat a virus, if you’re going to defeat a plague, if you’re going to defeat pandemics, the best way to do that and the easiest way is with information and data. If there’s a country not sharing that information and that data with the world, it becomes much more difficult to get out ahead of this and to develop vaccines, to mitigate, to know how to contact trace where things have come from. Honestly, I think that even though the media at large doesn’t like the president being tough on China, even other countries now are pointing to the fact that they weren’t being truthful with the world, and that’s a serious problem for them, and that’s something we’re not going to forget.”

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-05,"Report: China to Move 50,000 Uyghur Slaves to Factory ‘Rust Belt’ City","The Chinese government has resumed a job placement plan for tens of thousands of Uyghur Muslim “graduates” of compulsory “re-education” camps in China’s western region of Xinjiang, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Saturday, quoting sources with knowledge of the project.

The plan was finalized last year, but disrupted by the outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. It includes a quota for the numbers of Uyghur Muslims provinces must take.

The “re-education” camps function as concentration camps, part of standardized measures designed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to extinguish the cultural identity of Muslim Uyghurs, a Turkic people, and other minorities in Xinjiang, a far western province bordering Central Asia. Xinjiang, or East Turkestan, is China’s largest province and has struggled with Beijing-ordered “assimilation” of local cultures for decades.

Critics of the CCP argue that the “students” and “graduates” of the re-education camps have been unwilling participants in the indoctrination programs, better described as detainees, who have endured torture, medical experimentation, and other human rights abuses. The U.S. government has estimated that between one to three million ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities have been detained in the camps; there are roughly 10 million ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

Beijing rejects these criticisms. It argues that the camps are meant to provide Muslim Uyghurs the training they need to find better jobs and avoid the influence of Islamic separatists in Xinjiang who promote terrorism, according to China, the SCMP reports. Many camp victims already had successful careers and ample education before Chinese officials imprisoned them, however, weakening this argument.

Now claiming to have its coronavirus outbreak under control, the Chinese government has resumed the job placement deal for provinces to absorb Xinjiang laborers, sources told the SCMP. There is no evidence the laborers have any control over or say in where they work.

“Excellent graduates were to be taken on as laborers by various inland governments, in particular, 19 provinces and municipalities,” said the source, without specifying what constituted an “excellent” graduate.

Some sources earlier told SCMP that the program may be scaled back in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended the world economy, but its latest report indicates that this is not the case.

“The unemployment problem in Xinjiang must be resolved at all costs, despite the outbreak,” the Beijing source insisted.

According to the report, at least 19 provinces and cities have been assigned quotas to hire Muslim minorities, mostly Uyghurs, who have “graduated” from re-education camps.

As early as February, when the CCP claimed that the daily number of new infections had started to decrease outside Hubei province, China began to send Uyghur workers to their new job assignments, the SCMP reported.

By the end of February, Xinjiang alone had created “jobs” for over 60,000 Uyghur “graduates” from the camps.

The southern city of Shenzhen was given a target last year to eventually resettle 50,000 Uyghurs; the city plans to do this in several stages, with 15,000 to 20,000 planned for the first batch, sources told the SCMP. The CCP commonly uses the word “batch” to describe a group of Uyghur workers, seeming to lend authenticity to the sources’ claim.

“For every batch [of workers] that is trained, a batch of employment will be arranged and a batch will be transferred. Those employed need to receive thorough ideological education and remain in their jobs,” the CCP said in a Chinese government work report from 2019.

On March 1, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) published a study on forced Uyghur labor citing this work report as an example of Uyghur labor transfers set up by the Xinjiang provincial government. The Xinjiang government pays a price per head to other local governments and private brokers to organize the work transfer of Uyghurs from detention camps to labor assignments.

The ASPI report, “Uyghurs for Sale,” found that more than 80,000 Uyghur workers were transferred out of Xinjiang and into forced labor between 2017 and 2019, in a program labeled “Xinjiang Aid” by the CCP. The report notes that this type of systematic forced labor and transfer of Uyghurs out of Xinjiang has been in existence since the early 2000s.

The city of Shaoguan was also asked to take on another 30,000 to 50,000 Uyghur workers, the SCMP claimed. Shaoguan, in the southern Guangdong province, was the site of a deadly factory riot between Uyghurs and Han Chinese in 2009. This incident was believed to have sparked a relentless campaign by the majority Han Chinese against the Uyghurs that has lasted for years and included the concentration camps as well as the installation of mass surveillance technology in Xinjiang and human rights abuses such as the use of Uyghurs for organ harvesting and forcing Uyghur women to sleep with Han Chinese “relatives” in the same bed while their husbands were trapped in the camps.

In Fujian province, a government source also told the SCMP they had been told to hire “tens of thousands” of workers from Xinjiang.

“I heard the first batch … would arrive soon [in Fujian]. We have already received official directives asking us to handle their settlement with care,” the source said.

He added that the preparation work includes providing halal food to the Muslim workers as well as setting up stronger security measures to “minimize the risks of mass incidents.”

In March, Anhui Daily, Anhui province’s official newspaper, reported that the eastern province had received 1,560 “organized laborers from Xinjiang,” says the SCMP. One company headquartered in Anhui, the Haoyuanpeng Clothing Manufacturing Co. Ltd (HYP), participates in “Xinjiang Aid” by exporting Uyghur workers from Xinjiang to Anhui province, according to the ASPI report. HYP advertises strategic partnerships with Nike, Fila, Adidas, and Puma on its corporate website.

In February 2018, HYP transferred 63 workers from Xinjiang to its Anhui factory, with plans to eventually transfer 500 in total, the ASPI report said. The transferred workers were described as “graduates” of a detainment camp known officially as the Jiashi County Secondary Vocational School, according to a government report seen by the ASPI.

The ASPI analyzed satellite imagery and official documents suggesting that the Jiashi “vocational school” had operated as a re-education camp since 2017. The Jiashi compound increased in size, adding new dormitories and factory warehouses. In addition, significant security features were added to the structure indicating a secure “military-style management” of the compound, the ASPI reports.

Last month, reports surfaced that Uyghurs had been forced out of Xinjiang as early as March to work in factories in other provinces. The labor push was reportedly a similar effort by China to fill gaps in its economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Uyghurs were shipped out of Xinjiang by the thousands in this instance.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/05/05/report-china-move-50000-uyghur-slaves-factory-rust-belt-city/

['Frances Martel'],2020-05-05,Human Rights Watch to Africa: Don’t Let China Get Away with Racism,"Human Rights Watch called on Africa to unite and “unequivocally call on the Chinese government to cease all discrimination against Africans in China” on Tuesday, a response to ongoing reports of racist acts against black people in the country.

The reports have centered around allegedly anti-coronavirus policies in Guangzhou, southern China, home to one of the nation’s largest African populations. Restaurants in the city began posting signs in April explicitly stating they would not allow black people to enter. African citizens in the city said many landlords had abruptly evicted them, leaving them on the street, as hotels would not accept them either. Some said government officials had forced them into house arrest under the guise of quarantine even if they had not left the city in a long time, showed no signs of having contracted the Chinese coronavirus, and tested negative for the virus.

The Chinese Communist Party denied any racist acts had taken place on behalf of its citizens and claimed that the measures were necessary to curb the virus, which originated in central Wuhan, China. Chinese officials have insisted since late March that “imported” cases are the only threat to the Chinese, meaning foreigners require more scrutiny to keep the rates of infection low.

Some African governments have expressed disillusion with the Chinese regime, but many have deep financial ties to Beijing, compromising their stances. China has invested billions into a plan known as the “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), which it debuted as a plan to reconstruct the ancient Silk Road from western Europe to Beijing. Instead, it has invested in building expensive infrastructure projects in Africa, paid for through predatory loans offered to the local governments.

“African governments together should unequivocally call on the Chinese government to cease all discrimination against Africans in China, and carry out prompt and transparent investigations to hold to account all those responsible for discriminatory practices,” Carine Kaneza Nantulya, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement published Tuesday. “African governments should also press China to enforce measures to prevent discrimination in the future.”

The non-governmental organization’s China wing also demanded that the Communist Party “immediately investigate and hold accountable all officials and others responsible for discriminatory treatment.”

An article at Human Rights Watch’s site noted that “no evidence scientific basis” existed for discrimination against black people in the name of curbing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. It also asserted the Communist Party has long been complacent towards racism against black people:

Police frequently target Africans, often linked on Chinese social media with violent crimes and overstaying their visas, for immigration enforcement. Some job advertisements specifically exclude “heiren,” or blacks, or set a lower salary for African applicants. Some Africans report being paid less than their white colleagues for the same job. Many also said they have experienced of being turned away by taxis, restaurants, or shops. In 2018, a sketch aired during the annual Lunar New Year Gala on state TV featured a Chinese actress in blackface saying things such as “China has done so much for Africa,” and “I love Chinese people! I love China!” A Chinese laundry detergent brand advertisement showed a black man being pushed into a washing machine, getting “cleaned,” and emerging as a lighter skinned Asian.

The organization also published testimony from Africans in Guangzhou who experienced the allegedly coronavirus-related racism first-hand.

“We don’t know what to do, we don’t know where to go to, we have no money, nobody wants to talk about it. We want African governments to take up the issues with the Chinese government,” one man, identified by the pseudonym “John F.” said.

Others lamented that even the end of the pandemic would do little to help them. Micomyiza Jean-Claude, a citizen of Burundi, told Human Rights Watch, “Even after the isolation, people will shout and bully us, and call us ‘virus.’ Life will be different even after the pandemic.”

“I am very tired of being humiliated every day and African leaders keep quiet on racism going on in Guangzhou because they don’t want to spoil business they are doing together. The leaders give more value to business and close their eyes on humanity,” Jean-Claude added.

The first reports of racism against black people in Africa – not merely any African nationals – surfaced in mid-April in Guangzhou. Among the more outrageous reports was a sign posted at a local McDonald’s restaurant stating that black-skinned people were not allowed to enter the premises. Dramatic video footage of African citizens sleeping on the street – at a time in which most of the world is implementing some form of “stay-at-home” guideline – also surfaced. Locals not evicted from their homes complained that they were not allowed to leave their homes, even when testing negative for coronavirus.

“Some Africans in Guangzhou need to readjust their way of thinking. They are not onlookers in the face of COVID-19. Guangzhou is their second home,” the Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party propaganda newspaper, opined in response to the evidence of racism. “As a part of the city, they need to respect and comply with prevention and control measures just like everyone else. Controlling pandemic is not only for the benefit of the locals but also for the expat communities, including Africans.”

Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama declared his nation to be “extremely disappointed” by the reports and announced his government had demanded local consulate officials tally any material damages and every instance of racism against Nigerian citizens. Last week, Benjamin Kalu, the spokesman of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, announced a series of measures to hold China accountable for racism against Nigerian citizens.

2. There is no mutual respect where Chinese citizens are treated as kings in Nigeria while Nigerian citizens in China are treated as second rate humans, worse than dogs forced to starve and sleep in the streets. — Benjamin Kalu (Spokesperson House of Reps) (@BenKaluTweets) May 1, 2020

Among the new provisions would be a thorough inspection of Chinese citizens’ legality in being present in China. Chinese citizens in good standing with the Communist Party are known to regularly run afoul of local immigration laws in Belt and Road countries in Africa.

Attorneys in Nigeria also announced last week they are seeking $200 billion in damages from China for unleashing the coronavirus pandemic on the world.

Some said government officials had forced them into house arrest under the guise of quarantine even if they had not left the city in a long time, showed no signs of having contracted the Chinese coronavirus, and tested negative for the virus.

The Chinese Communist Party denied any racist acts had taken place on behalf of its citizens and claimed that the measures were necessary to curb the virus, which originated in central Wuhan, China. Chinese officials have insisted since late March that “imported” cases are the only threat to the Chinese, meaning foreigners require more scrutiny to keep the rates of infection low.

Some African governments have expressed disillusion with the Chinese regime, but many have deep financial ties to Beijing, compromising their stances. China has invested billions into a plan known as the “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), which it debuted as a plan to reconstruct the ancient Silk Road from western Europe to Beijing. Instead, it has invested in building expensive infrastructure projects in Africa, paid for through predatory loans offered to the local governments.

“African governments together should unequivocally call on the Chinese government to cease all discrimination against Africans in China, and carry out prompt and transparent investigations to hold to account all those responsible for discriminatory practices,” Carine Kaneza Nantulya, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement published Tuesday. “African governments should also press China to enforce measures to prevent discrimination in the future.”

The non-governmental organization’s China wing also demanded that the Communist Party “immediately investigate and hold accountable all officials and others responsible for discriminatory treatment.”

An article at Human Rights Watch’s site noted that “no evidence scientific basis” existed for discrimination against black people in the name of curbing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. It also asserted the Communist Party has long been complacent towards racism against black people:

Police frequently target Africans, often linked on Chinese social media with violent crimes and overstaying their visas, for immigration enforcement. Some job advertisements specifically exclude “heiren,” or blacks, or set a lower salary for African applicants. Some Africans report being paid less than their white colleagues for the same job. Many also said they have experienced of being turned away by taxis, restaurants, or shops. In 2018, a sketch aired during the annual Lunar New Year Gala on state TV featured a Chinese actress in blackface saying things such as “China has done so much for Africa,” and “I love Chinese people! I love China!” A Chinese laundry detergent brand advertisement showed a black man being pushed into a washing machine, getting “cleaned,” and emerging as a lighter skinned Asian.

The organization also published testimony from Africans in Guangzhou who experienced the allegedly coronavirus-related racism first-hand.

“We don’t know what to do, we don’t know where to go to, we have no money, nobody wants to talk about it. We want African governments to take up the issues with the Chinese government,” one man, identified by the pseudonym “John F.” said.

Others lamented that even the end of the pandemic would do little to help them. Micomyiza Jean-Claude, a citizen of Burundi, told Human Rights Watch, “Even after the isolation, people will shout and bully us, and call us ‘virus.’ Life will be different even after the pandemic.”

“I am very tired of being humiliated every day and African leaders keep quiet on racism going on in Guangzhou because they don’t want to spoil business they are doing together. The leaders give more value to business and close their eyes on humanity,” Jean-Claude added.

The first reports of racism against black people in Africa – not merely any African nationals – surfaced in mid-April in Guangzhou. Among the more outrageous reports was a sign posted at a local McDonald’s restaurant stating that black-skinned people were not allowed to enter the premises. Dramatic video footage of African citizens sleeping on the street – at a time in which most of the world is implementing some form of “stay-at-home” guideline – also surfaced. Locals not evicted from their homes complained that they were not allowed to leave their homes, even when testing negative for coronavirus.

“Some Africans in Guangzhou need to readjust their way of thinking. They are not onlookers in the face of COVID-19. Guangzhou is their second home,” the Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party propaganda newspaper, opined in response to the evidence of racism. “As a part of the city, they need to respect and comply with prevention and control measures just like everyone else. Controlling pandemic is not only for the benefit of the locals but also for the expat communities, including Africans.”

Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama declared his nation to be “extremely disappointed” by the reports and announced his government had demanded local consulate officials tally any material damages and every instance of racism against Nigerian citizens. Last week, Benjamin Kalu, the spokesman of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, announced a series of measures to hold China accountable for racism against Nigerian citizens.

2. There is no mutual respect where Chinese citizens are treated as kings in Nigeria while Nigerian citizens in China are treated as second rate humans, worse than dogs forced to starve and sleep in the streets. — Benjamin Kalu (Spokesperson House of Reps) (@BenKaluTweets) May 1, 2020

Among the new provisions would be a thorough inspection of Chinese citizens’ legality in being present in China. Chinese citizens in good standing with the Communist Party are known to regularly run afoul of local immigration laws in Belt and Road countries in Africa.

Attorneys in Nigeria also announced last week they are seeking $200 billion in damages from China for unleashing the coronavirus pandemic on the world.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-05,Anthony Fauci Checked on Sick 'Friend' Chris Cuomo Every Day,"Appearing Monday on CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he spoke daily with primetime host Christopher Cuomo during his coronavirus illness because he was worried about his condition.

A partial transcript is as follows:

CHRISTOPHER CUOMO: How do I know what Tony Fauci thinks? I’ve known him a lot of my life, but I’ve never known him the way I know you through this pandemic. I have spoken to you, almost without exception, every day. You have been calling me out of personal concern to make sure that I was okay, my wife was okay, my son was okay. 11 o’clock at night. Later. Waiting for my show to end, Saturday, Sunday morning, the rare time you have with your family. Why? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: First of all, you’re a friend. We have a professional relationship, but you’re a friend. I’ve known you, I hate to say it, since you were almost a kid. And the fact is, you were going through some difficult times. I don’t think that people seeing you on this show were really experiencing or realizing how you were really sucking it up to look relatively normal. But when you finished the show, when we started chatting at 11 o’clock, 11:30 at night, you were wiped out. You not only had the acute difficulty of the virus that was replicating in you, but you had some of the secondary effects. […] I cared about you, but I was worried about you. That’s the reason why I kept calling.

Cuomo announced he tested positive for the coronavirus on March 31 and said he planned to quarantine in his basement to prevent his wife and children from also contracting the illness. However, his wife, Cristina, and 14-year-old son, Mario, ended up getting sick anyway.

During Cuomo’s illness, a biker who identified himself as David, told the New York Post that he witnessed the CNN anchor violating quarantine on Easter Sunday by taking his family to inspect an undeveloped property in East Hampton. David alleges that when he confronted Cuomo about breaking quarantine, the newsman verbally attacked him. The biker, a lifelong Democrat who voted for the CNN host’s brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), said he was so shaken by the incident that he filed a report with the East Hampton police.

The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its service-sector index fell to 41.8 in April, compared with a March reading of 52.5.

Any reading below 50 signals that the service sector, where the majority of Americans work, is in a contraction. It was the first time the services index has been in contraction since December 2009 and it was the lowest reading since March of that year with the nation mired in the Great Recession.

In April, all major categories fell sharply with the business activity index dropping to 26, the lowest reading on record, while the new orders index fell to 32.9 and the employment index dropped to 30. Prices moved up.

Two sectors reported expansion in the quarter: public administration and finance.

“Due to increased loans from [the federal] stimulus package, [we are] seeing an increase in new business,” a respondent in the financial sector said.

James Rutherford, an analyst with Stephen Inc, said in a note recently that 1,043 Wendy’s restaurants, around 18 percent of the U.S. total, have listed beef items as out of stock.

Oddly enough, more than 100 of those locations still sell Wendy’s chili, which contains beef, according to Rutherford.

As food supply chains struggle to keep up with demand amid the Covid-19 outbreak, CNBC’s Amelia Lucas reports that nearly a fifth of Wendy’s U.S. restaurants have run out of beef, according to a study by Stephens Inc.

Rutherford’s note was first reported by CNBC.

The New York Post reports:

Hamburgers have disappeared from some of the fast-food chain’s restaurants as the coronavirus crisis roils the country’s meat supply. Some Wendy’s locations postedsigns warning that their signature “fresh, never frozen” beef was not available, photos show. Other eateries said they were not serving burgers with two or three patties, customers said on Twitter. Many restaurants in Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and New York restaurants are currently out of beef, while other states’ menus do not suggest there are any supply chain issues.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,Democrat Harley Rouda Spotted on Private Beach; Backed Public Beach Closures in Orange County,"First-term Democrat Rep. Harley Rouda of California was spotted on a private beach in Orange County — even as he supported Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) criticism of communities that kept their beaches open to the public.

Last Thursday, Gov. Newsom ordered a “hard close” of beaches in Orange County, having scolded communities in the county for keeping beaches open to large numbers of people during a heat wave the previous weekend. Local communities argued that most beachgoers had maintained “social distancing,” and resolved to add more law enforcement to beaches while keeping beaches open. That was not good enough for Newsom — or Rouda.

In a statement last Thursday, Rep. Rouda criticized communities that had kept their beaches open: “Opening beaches to thousands of Southern Californians during a weekend heat-wave without adequate social-distancing protocols was a reckless action that put the families of California’s 48th district in harm’s way.”

However, Rouda himself was seen on a private beach with his family in Orange County last weekend.

CBS News 2020 campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar broke the story (original emphasis):

Photos obtained first by CBS News show Democratic Congressman Harley Rouda spending time at a private beach in Southern California despite orders from Governor Gavin Newsom to close some public beaches in the area, CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports. Rouda, a first-term Congressman who beat Dana Rohrabacher, represents the 48th district, which encompasses Orange County. Last week Newsom specifically ordered a “hard close” on Orange County beaches after photos showing people not respecting social distancing went viral on social media. Rouda’s campaign manager said in a statement that Rouda and his family “were actively moving and adequately socially distancing on a residential beach, which has explicitly outlined beach access requirements in accordance with Governor Newsom’s beach order.”

Rouda defeated veteran Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) in the 48th congressional district in 2018, basing his campaign in part on accusations that the incumbent was too favorable toward U.S.-Russia relations.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019 that there was no evidence of “collusion” between the Russian government and any American citizen.

['Sean Moran'],2020-05-05,McCarthy: House GOP to Establish Investigation into Origins of Chinese Coronavirus,"House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News during a press conference call on Tuesday that, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) continues to block an investigation into the origins of the Chinese coronavirus, House Republicans will move forward with their own investigation.

Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle this weekend that Pelosi would rather investigate President Donald Trump than the origins of the Chinese coronavirus and whether U.S. taxpayer dollars went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Intelligence officials increasingly believe that the virus leaked from the Wuhan institute.

“We should have an investigative body looking at these grants, but Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that,” Reschenthaler told Breitbart News Saturday. “So you have myself and House Republicans. I can tell you I’m going to continue to look into these grants.”

Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Ronna McDaniel echoed Reschenthaler’s statement on Monday, saying, “Instead of launching another witch hunt, Nancy Pelosi should be investigating the origins of this virus.”

“If she truly cares about oversight, she should demand answers regarding China, not @realdonaldtrump,” she added.

Trump retweeted McDaniel’s call for Pelosi to investigate the beginnings of the Chinese coronavirus.

Exciting to see our Country starting to open up again! https://t.co/My5yPSZdS3 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2020

McCarthy told Breitbart News that he believes that Pelosi is blocking an investigation into the virus.

“The answer is yes,” he said, confirming that he believes Pelosi is blocking the investigation. “And, if you saw my letter to the speaker a couple of weeks ago, one of the items was that Oversight should be looking at the [World Health Organization].”

“Every day that Congress is not in session gives a pass to China — makes us weaker in the process,” he added.

McCarthy then revealed that he was able to get bipartisan support for a committee to investigate China, but that later, Democrat leadership relented.

The Republican leader said, “I last year went to the Democrats, trying to get a bipartisan group to look at China. I had members, Republicans and Democrats, agree to it, and leadership first said yes on the other side. It was going to be an equal number, and now they backtracked on it.”

McCarthy charged that, despite Pelosi’s opposition to a Chinese coronavirus investigation, House Republicans will start their own investigation.

He said, “I gave my names up. We were going forward with it, but you will see that the Republicans, because the Democrats will not work together [with us] on that, we will put our own China committee together and not sit back and allow this to continue.”

['Amy Furr'],2020-05-05,Suspect Arrested for Wiping Nose on Clerk When Asked to Wear Mask,"A man was arrested Monday for allegedly wiping his nose on a store clerk’s shirt in Holly, Michigan, over the weekend.

In a Facebook post on Saturday, the Holly Police Department asked for the public’s help in identifying a suspect who entered the Dollar Tree store on N. Saginaw St. without wearing a mask and reportedly assaulted an employee.

Security footage showed the moment when the man, wearing a checkered shirt and sunglasses, walked behind the employee as she stood in one of the aisles.

“The clerk advised the man that all in-store customers must wear a mask to enter the store as stated on the signs posted on the entry doors,” the department said.

Moments later, the man approached the clerk and reportedly told her, “Here, I will use this as a mask,” then wiped his nose on the sleeve of her shirt before walking away.

The department said the man “continued to be loud and disruptive inside the store before leaving in a white possibly Ford window van.”

In an update Monday, the department explained that an arrest had been made in the case and thanked residents for their help.

“Thank you to all who shared this post, a viewer tip assisted investigators in determining the identity of the suspect,” the update read, adding that details on the arrest would be released following arraignment.

Michigan residents who chose not to wear masks in public would not face criminal penalties or fines, according to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

However, businesses did have the right to turn customers away if they were not wearing a mask, WWMT reported.

As part of its efforts to guard against the coronavirus, Dollar Tree made gloves and masks available for employees to wear while they worked.

“Our Associates are the heart of our Company, and I’m overwhelmed by their ongoing commitment to you and the communities we serve,” wrote the company’s Chief Executive Officer Gary Philbin.

Following the incident on Saturday, Holly Police Chief Jerry Narsh said the clerk did the right thing considering the circumstances.

“She’s fine. She was frightened. Clearly, when something like this happens it’s unexpected. She was upset, she did the right thing. She didn’t confront him in the store. She contacted her manager who contacted the police,” he concluded.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/05/05/suspect-arrested-for-wiping-nose-on-clerks-shirt-when-asked-to-wear-a-mask/

So why is Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms encouraging residents to stay at home and ignore Gov. Brian Kemp’s effort to begin reopening the city?

Black business owners should have the opportunity that Governor Kemp wants to give them: the right to reopen their businesses, maintain their livelihoods, and get back to work.

Mayor Bottoms will tell you that coronavirus fears are behind her warnings, but Georgia’s COVID-19 numbers lag far behind the rest of the country in terms of infections and deaths.

According to Google’s COVID-19 tracker, Georgia has nearly 30,000 confirmed cases and around 1,250 deaths, far below the cases and deaths seen by New York State, the epicenter of the pandemic, that is counting nearly 320,000 cases and over 19,000 deaths.

Mayor Bottoms says that beginning the path to reopening Georgia is “deadly.” Yet while it is true that African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, it is also true that the vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus are among older Americans with pre-existing health conditions.

So why not create messaging for the African American population of Georgia that allows black small business owners to explore the protocols they need to take to safely reopen, and encourage the most vulnerable members of the community to stay inside?

Framing the allowed but not mandated reopening of small businesses in Georgia as an implicit attack on an African American voter base more vulnerable to COVID-19 leads to misinformation and conspiracy theories, and is counterproductive to keeping Atlanta’s citizens healthy in every way, including economically.

Telling a young and healthy small business owner to wait until his or her business is fully destroyed with no chance of coming back because the “science” says so is the kind of messaging that will continue to hurt American citizens of all colors. Moreover, business owners should be given the opportunity to make decisions about their own businesses.

Bottoms’ vociferous stance against reopening the economy, ostensibly to protect black citizens, has the unintended consequence of hurting black business owners in the Mecca for black entrepreneurship.

As Y’Kheyo Underwood, owner of the Good Look barber shop in Marietta, Georgia, told USA Today: “The people who are at home and still getting paid by their companies. If you are in my position, with a small business, you know the only way of getting income is by opening up your establishment.”

Bad messaging – particularly the kind of messaging coming from Bottoms – is especially bad for black businesses. The shaming of Georgia residents of all colors eager to get back to work and run their businesses is wrong, and will hurt the citizens that public officials have pledged to help protect.

It’s up to the business owners and citizens of Atlanta, Georgia, and eventually the rest of the country to figure out a safe, sane way to reopen their businesses while ensuring the safety of our most vulnerable populations. We shouldn’t stand in their way.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/05/05/rob-smith-atlanta-black-business/

['John Nolte'],2020-05-05,"Nolte: 3,000 Moviegoers Flock to Three Texas Theaters on Reopening Weekend","At just three movie theaters in San Antonio, Texas, some 3,000 ticket-buyers showed up during the first open weekend since the coronavirus pandemic struck.

Tickets were discounted to just $5.41, and on the 19 screens in those three theaters, the offerings were only older titles — Trolls World Tour, Bloodshot, I Still Believe, The Hunt, and Bad Boys for Life. So while roughly $9,000 in ticket sales would not normally make the news, when you consider the discount ticket price, the lack of fresh titles, and the fact America is still dealing with a plague, this is being seen as a good sign people are eager to return to normal, and normal means a weekend trip to the movies.

Texas is one of the few states that allowed movie theaters to open up. The theaters are, however, required to limit capacity to just 25 percent. This means that every other seating row is closed off, and in the open rows, customers are kept six feet apart. If you come as a couple or party, you are allowed to sit together.

The concession stands are open, but no refills are allowed.

A Hollywood executive told the far-left Hollywood Reporter that this news “shows me there is a pent-up demand.”

The news is undoubtedly a good sign, and when you look at those titles, it is pretty safe to assume those Texans went to the movies just to go to the movies again, to feel normal again. Every one of those titles is already available through video on demand, and has been for awhile.

This news combined with the near-swarming of beaches (whether those beaches are authorized to open or not) does show a “pent-up demand,” a phrase President Trump has repeatedly used to describe his view of a future when the lockdowns end and the economy recovers by way of an explosion of activity and commerce.

We can only hope.

In the end, though, this is going to be a game of chicken… In order to truly test the waters, some Big Studio is going to have to take the risk of releasing a Big Movie… Will it be Disney’s Mulan or Marvel’s (also Disney) Black Widow? Who’s going to take the plunge to test the waters, especially with a title that needs to clean up worldwide in order to just break even?

As it stands, Christopher Nolan’s latest epic, Tenet, is scheduled to go first on July 17, followed by Mulan on July 27, and Wonder Woman 1984 on August 14.

Those are the only blockbusters on the summer calendar right now. This could change depending on how things go. What I mean is that those three titles could be pulled by skittish studios, or if those titles do well, if moviegoers return in throngs due to a pent-up demand, the massive holes in that summer schedule could be filled by a Black Widow (currently reschedule for November) and others.

It’s hard to imagine a summer with only three blockbusters.

A lot of what happens at the movies will depend on how savvy Americans are to the realistic threat of the coronavirus. As I have pointed out countless times in the past, it doesn’t really matter when things reopen. There’s no vaccine and there’s no risk of our health care system crashing, so it will be no safer to reopen in July than it is today.

Since we’re unlikely to see a vaccine in the next 12 to 18 months (if ever), unless you are willing to quarantine for at least another year, there’s no point in not returning to normal as soon as possible. That doesn’t mean you should be reckless. Masks, hand washing, and social distancing are good ideas.

Nevertheless, no one — not the scientists, not the Democrat governors holding their states in lockdowns — has been able to explain to the public what the public health benefit is to locking us down one day longer than today.

If the world is not going to be any safer two weeks, two months, or a year from now, why not reopen now? Why not return to normality now?

Of course, the fake news media have shifted the goal posts from us locking down to slow the spread of the virus as a means to keep our medical system from crashing (which makes total sense), to this absurd notion that we must now stay closed to save as many lives as we can.

If Americans fall for that ridiculous standard, movie-going will never return because we may never have a cure, which means it will never be any safer to return to normal than it is right now.

According to the media’s dumb standard of locking down to save lives, we can never return to normal until its 100 percent safe, and even a vaccine cannot make us 100 percent safe. That absurd mindset will kill the movies forever.

Of course, there’s always this solution.

['John Nolte'],2020-05-05,Nolte: 26% of Democrats Want Joe Biden Replaced After Hearing Tara Reade Denial,"With 26 percent of Democrat voters now calling for Joe Biden to be replaced as the Democrat presidential nominee, there is no question the former vice president’s Morning Joe appearance, where he denied sexually assaulting Tara Reade in 1993, was a disaster.

Only 61 percent of Democrats says Biden should not be replaced. And of those 61 percent, only a measly 41 percent say he should definitely not be replaced.

Morning Consult conducted the poll of 1,991 registered voters and showed them a 35-second video clip of Biden’s denial. There is a two-point margin of error.

When broken down by age, a whopping 40 percent of Democrats under the age of 45 want Biden gone, while just 15 percent of Democrats 45 and over agree.

On the issue of Biden’s credibility, when surveying all voters — both Democrats and Republicans — only 41 percent found Biden’s denial credible, while 38 percent said it was not credible.

Only 61 percent of Democrats found Biden’s denial credible, while 19 percent said it was not credible.

Only 53 percent of younger Democrats, those under age 45, found Biden’s denial credible; while 67 percent of Democrats 45 and up found Biden’s denial credible.

Tara Reade has credibly alleged that in 1993, while she was working in Biden’s Senate office, the then-Delaware Senator cornered her against a wall, forced his hands under her skirt, and forced his fingers into her vagina.

Biden denies the incident ever took place.

Reade is a lifelong Democrat and investigative reporters have found five contemporaneous witnesses who confirm Reade told them about the incident at or near the time Reade says it happened.

What’s more, there is video of Reade’s now-deceased mother calling into a 1993 edition of CNN’s Larry King Live looking for advice about her daughter’s problems with a “prominent senator.”

Except for this one Morning Joe appearance, and with the help of the corrupt corporate media, Biden has remained hidden and not faced any tough questions about the allegations.

Meanwhile, Reade is challenging investigative reporters to dig into her story and risked prison last month by filing a formal criminal complaint against Biden.

Reade has also called for Biden to open up his Senate papers, which are currently being kept in secret at the University of Delaware.

Reade claims she filed a sexual harassment complaint against Biden (this was separate from the alleged assault) and that a copy of the complaint might be found among Biden’s papers. Biden is adamantly refusing any outsiders access to those papers. He even refused the idea of allowing a judge to look though them.

Reade is the eighth woman to accuse Biden of sexual misconduct. In an effort to put the scandal to bed, Biden created talking points full of lies and in a disheartening repeat of the Clinton 90s, Biden sent prominent women out to lie for him.

The poll claims there is good news for Biden because he is polling better with Democrats on this issue than disgraced former Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) and then-Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) did during their sexual harassment scandals. By respective margins of 48 and 43 percent, Democrats found the misconduct allegations against Franken and Conyers credible.

But that glimmer of good news is a bit misleading. Nowhere in this poll are respondents asked the straightforward questions about whether or not they find the allegations against Biden credible. There is no apples-to-apples comparison.

A second bit of good news is that those who want Biden replaced are primarily young people, and it is safe to assume that some or most of those younger people are supporters of Bernie Sanders who might still be bitter over losing to Biden. Nevertheless, Biden will still need their votes in November and Reade’s increasingly-credible allegation is just one more reason for them stay home.

In this poll, Biden beats President Trump 45 to 41 percent in a head-to-head match-up.

Known as “El Boto or Marruecos,” Cesar Sepulveda Arellano, a leading member of Los Viagras Cartel and the founder of the faction known as “Blancos de Troya,” was in the state prison of Mil Cumbres in Michoacán awaiting trial for the murder of Buenavista Mayor Javier Urena Gonzales. However, on April 30, a state judge ordered his release after state prosecutors were not able to “present” enough evidence to move forward with the case.

In August 2018, El Boto placed a $100,000 hit on Jose Luis Lara, a writer for Cartel Chronicles and a founding member of the Self-Defense Movement in Michoacán. Less than 48 hours after the offer was extended, the Mexican Army and Navy followed an anonymous tip to a house in Morelos–where they arrested him. El Boto at the time claimed Lara was a spy for the U.S. government.

Almost immediately after his release, El Boto sent messages to avocado growers in Michoacán claiming they must pay extortion fees to his men. The release of the kingpin comes as violence between Los Viagras and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion spreads terror throughout the region. Both are fighting for control of the region’s drug production and trafficking routes.

['Lucas Nolan'],2020-05-05,Report: Adult Cam Site Suffers Massive Security Breach,"According to a recent report, adult cam website Cam4.com left almost seven terabytes of private data exposed on the internet. The massive leak contained nearly 11 billion records including payment history, email and conversation logs, and IP addresses.

A recent report from security researchers at Safety Detectives claims that the adult live-streaming website Cam4.com, which is owned by Irish firm Granity Entertainment, exposed a server database containing 7 terabytes of production logs dating from March 16, 2020, and increasing daily.

The Elastic Search database was reportedly completely unsecured and included a huge amount of user and company information including a vast majority of email data records belonging to users in the United States. Americans were the worst effected group by the leak, along with Brazilians and Italians.

The site owners were immediately contacted and the server was secured shortly afterward. After reaching out to Cam4.com, the Safety Detectives security team received a prompt response which also advised the researchers to contact another company called Smart-X.net. Cam4.com and Smart-X.net are both owned by a parent company called Surecom Corp.

10.88 billion records including personally identifiable information were leaked as a result of the unsecured server. The leaked data included:

First and last names

Email addresses

Country of origin

Sign-up dates

Gender preference and sexual orientation

Device information

Miscellaneous user details such as spoken language

Usernames

Payments logs including credit card type, amount paid and applicable currency

User conversations

Transcripts of email correspondence

Inter-user conversations

Chat transcripts between users and CAM4

Token information

Password hashes

IP addresses

Fraud detection logs

Spam detection logs

Some logs further revealed users’ password information. The number of emails leaked exceeded several million according to the researchers. U.S., Brazillian, and Italian users were reportedly the worst affected by the leak.

['Lucas Nolan'],2020-05-05,Report: Adult Cam Site Suffers Massive Security Breach,"According to a recent report, adult cam website Cam4.com left almost seven terabytes of private data exposed on the internet. The massive leak contained nearly 11 billion records including payment history, email and conversation logs, and IP addresses.

A recent report from security researchers at Safety Detectives claims that the adult live-streaming website Cam4.com, which is owned by Irish firm Granity Entertainment, exposed a server database containing 7 terabytes of production logs dating from March 16, 2020, and increasing daily.

The Elastic Search database was reportedly completely unsecured and included a huge amount of user and company information including a vast majority of email data records belonging to users in the United States. Americans were the worst effected group by the leak, along with Brazilians and Italians.

The site owners were immediately contacted and the server was secured shortly afterward. After reaching out to Cam4.com, the Safety Detectives security team received a prompt response which also advised the researchers to contact another company called Smart-X.net. Cam4.com and Smart-X.net are both owned by a parent company called Surecom Corp.

10.88 billion records including personally identifiable information were leaked as a result of the unsecured server. The leaked data included:

First and last names

Email addresses

Country of origin

Sign-up dates

Gender preference and sexual orientation

Device information

Miscellaneous user details such as spoken language

Usernames

Payments logs including credit card type, amount paid and applicable currency

User conversations

Transcripts of email correspondence

Inter-user conversations

Chat transcripts between users and CAM4

Token information

Password hashes

IP addresses

Fraud detection logs

Spam detection logs

Some logs further revealed users’ password information. The number of emails leaked exceeded several million according to the researchers. U.S., Brazillian, and Italian users were reportedly the worst affected by the leak.

In January, Breitbart News reported on another massive breach of the “pussycash” cam site network. That leak primarily focused on the personal information of cam performers.

['Lucas Nolan'],2020-05-05,Apple and Google Promise to Ban Location Tracking in Apps Using ‘Contact Tracing’ Tech,"Apple and Google have reportedly claimed that they will ban the use of location tracking in apps using the new contact tracing system being developed by the two tech giants that they say will help slow the spread of the Chinese virus.

Reuters reports that tech giants Apple and Google have promised to ban location tracking features in apps that take advantage of the new Wuhan coronavirus contact tracing system being developed together by the two Silicon Valley giants.

Apple and Google allege that unlike other systems, theirs will not collect location information or identifying information about those that test positive for the coronavirus. They also require that a person consent to the data that the companies do collect on them. The companies claim that health authorities will be able to include a way to verify that someone tested positive such as a QR code from a hospital, addressing concerns that people could falsely claim that they tested positive.

Google and Apple have both reportedly made changes to their mobile operating systems to allow the devices to exchange a private key with nearby smartphones via Bluetooth, logging when users come into close proximity. If an individual tests positive for the Wuhan coronavirus and enters that information into an app, 14 days’ worth of their contact with other users is sent to a server.

The phones regularly check if any recently encountered individuals have been reported as infected and alerts users with a notification. The notification states that someone they have been in contact with has tested positive and provides them with more information. This system is running on mobile devices running iOS 13 or on any version of the Android operating system from 2015 on.

Software firm Twenty which developed the state of Utah’s Healthy Together contact tracing app which uses both GPS tracking and Bluetooth said on Monday that the app “operates effectively” without needing to rely on Apple and Google’s new system.

“If their approach can be more effective than our current solution, we’ll eagerly incorporate their features into our existing application, provided it meets the specifications of current and prospective public health partners,” Twenty said.

The province of Alberta in Canada, which does not collect GPS data, stated that it has no plans to adopt Apple and google’s system for its ABTraceTogether App.

9to5Mac previously reported that Apple and Google are now using the term “Exposure Notification” to describe their system instead of “Contact Tracing” in an attempt to emphasize the benefit of the system and make it sound less like a surveillance system.

['Allum Bokhari'],2020-05-05,Bokhari: The Booming ‘Gig Economy’ Is a Plutocrat’s Paradise,"In days past, if you were risking your life for low pay, that likely meant you were a soldier. The upside: survival skills, high status, a free college degree, and good benefits. These days, though, you can risk your life for low pay and get none of those benefits, as a member of the pandemic “Gig Economy.”

As you might expect, the Gig Economy is booming at the moment — with workers being laid off from their regular jobs, the modern-day proletariat has few places to turn but companies like Instacart, to meet the rising demand for home grocery deliveries, along with the myriad companies offering restaurant delivery.

Good news though, Instacart is committed to the safety of its employees — oh no, wait, it isn’t. Instacart has failed to provide its rapidly-growing army of shoppers with an adequate supply of hand sanitizer, masks, and other personal protective equipment (PPE). Hazard pay? Don’t be silly — according to the Gig Workers’ Collective, the company hasn’t even increased its default tip amount beyond 10 percent.

The “gig economy” is a new phrase, coined by Silicon Valley to make modern-day tech slavery sound cute. What it really means is that you’ll work harder than your parents did, for less pay, with less stability, with no benefits, and no workers’ rights.

The classic example is ridesharing apps, which displaced the once-stable industry of taxi cabs. There once was a time where taxi cab drivers could earn a decent living, even support a family on their salary. Try doing that with Uber or Lyft! According to a report from several years ago, only four percent of Uber drivers stay with the company for at least a year.

Although if you’re going to earn a living driving, there’s not much of an alternative — taxi drivers in New York City who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to acquire official taxi medallions are now committing suicide as ridesharing apps displace their once-lucrative industry. Free-market libertarians like to praise the disruption brought about by the “invisible hand of the market,” but they neglect to mention that it sometimes carries a knife. That isn’t purely metaphorical either — the company admitted to 3,000 sexual assaults by its drivers in 2018.

The Gig Economy is, of course, an invention of the modern tech elite, which probably thinks American serfs are living the good life compared to the Chinese sweatshop workers who assemble Android and Apple devices (they’re prone to killing themselves too, by the way).

The tech companies know that depriving their workers of regular employment rights is key to their business model. That’s why Uber and Postmates, two giants of the Gig Economy, are suing the state of California to overturn a law that would classify their gig workers are employees.

Even when tech workers are given regular employee status, they are still treated with contempt. There’s no better example than Amazon. Run by the plutocrat of plutocrats, world’s richest man Jeff Bezos, the company seems to commit a new outrage against its employees every week. Most recently, the tech giant fired an employee at one of its New York distribution centers for daring to tell his coworkers – and the public – that there was a coronavirus outbreak at the facility.

Then again, this is the same company that patented a system to put employees in cages, reportedly pressures employees not to take bathroom breaks, and allegedly fires women for becoming pregnant.

My favorite example of Amazon’s intense hatred of its own employees is the “heat map” it uses on employees of its Whole Foods stores, to discover which ones are most at risk of unionization. On of the reported findings of the “heat map” is that stores with a higher level of racial diversity – and, presumably, less cohesion – are less likely to unionize.

With such Machiavellian warfare on their own employees, is it any wonder that a Gig Economy stalwart like GrubHub saw the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to pinch pennies from cash-strapped restaurants? The delivery app is accused of forcing restaurants to offer customers discounts, while still charging commission fees based on the full original price of deliveries. Delivery services are also trying to pull the wool over restaurant owners’ eyes by listing them on their apps without the restaurants’ knowledge, even when the restaurants in question don’t offer delivery or takeout.

Even before the virus, gig workers at Instacart were now so mistrustful of their Silicon Valley masters that they asked the U.S. Department of Labor to investigate allegedly missing tips. Instacart once even tried to make tips count towards workers’ overall wages, before backlash forced it to reverse the policy. And the app has yet to fix a loophole that allows customers to lure Instacart shoppers with the promise of big tips, only to adjust the tips downwards or cancel them altogether after delivery. Other popular delivery apps like DoorDash have also made headlines for adding tips to their bottom line instead of giving them to the gig workers.

Historians have long observed that a grim upside to global pandemics is that a reduction in the supply of labor leads to improved working conditions for survivors. Thanks to technology, it looks like the reverse is true of coronavirus. For America’s proletariat, the only light at the end of the tunnel is the notification on their smartphones, a message from their slavemasters in Silicon Valley, cheerfully reminding them that Pride month is next week and that their default tips have been reduced by 5 percent.

['Allum Bokhari'],2020-05-05,Bokhari: Tech Censorship Is Now a Public Health Hazard,"The Democrats and their progressive allies in Silicon Valley and the mainstream media have spent the last two decades convincing themselves that they are the “party of science.” In their frantic panic to censor material related to the Chinese virus, we’re now seeing the dangerous outcome of that hubris.

You would think that the doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, ranked as the eighth-best hospital in the United States by U.S. News & World Report, knows a bit more about medicine than the blue-haired censors at YouTube.

But the YouTube censors are convinced they know better, recently censoring a video from AYTU BioScience about “Healight,” an experimental UV light treatment the company is developing as a potential treatment for the coronavirus in partnership with a team at Cedars-Sinai.

AYTU BioScience is a Colorado-based pharmaceutical company publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange that has developed a wide range of successful drugs. You’d think they know a thing or two about medicine. But again, YouTube appears to disagree. After all, Silicon Valley’s masters in the mainstream media insist that UV light treatment, mentioned by the president, must be dangerous, wrong, and only advocated by “conspiracy theorists.”

In an exceptionally dishonest headline, Bloomberg Technology wrote that AYTU “sees an opportunity” in Trump’s comments on the treatment, even though the company and Cedars-Sinai had been investigating UV light treatment well before the president made his remarks.

Of course, UV light treatment is still in the early stages of research — if successful, the results will be published in medical journals, which doctors tend to pay more attention to than YouTube or NBC. Nevertheless, the censorship is still a problem — it stifles creative discussion around potential areas of research, and makes information about those area of research harder to find.

As we know from Breitbart’s past reporting, YouTube is happy to take censorship cues from the mainstream media. In 2019, the company altered its search results for the term “abortion” within hours of receiving a complaint by a left-wing Slate writer.

The censorship of AYTU is just one example of Silicon Valley’s coronavirus overreach. YouTube has also censored a video of two doctors in Bakersfield, California, who recommended an early end to the nationwide shutdowns.

Facebook has branded anti-lockdown protests “misinformation” whose organizers will be banned, and has censored a video from Project Veritas containing remarks from officials at a testing center in New York, as well as videos from Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro discussing the need to balance addressing the pandemic with averting economic disaster.

Twitter also banned Bolsonaro’s videos, as well as a post from Fox News host Laura Ingraham discussing hydroxychloroquine. The platform says it will ban coronavirus-related claims that cause “harmful activity,” whatever that means.

And let’s not forget that Chinese internet censorship, which helped prevent information about the coronavirus from getting out in the first place, takes place with the assistance of American technology companies.

Scarcely four months ago, the world was largely unaware of the Wuhan coronavirus. And yet, Silicon Valley believes it — or the media, or bureaucrats (who can’t make up their mind on whether we should wear masks or not) — has all the answers.

This is scientifically illiterate. Doctors and scientists aren’t known for agreeing with each other, and they especially aren’t known for agreeing with each other when so little is known about the virus. Scientists in New York say that smoking raises the risk of severe coronavirus symptoms. Scientists in France say that smoking might actually help the body fight coronavirus symptoms. Who’s right? We don’t know — especially because there’s barely been time to carry out tests. In the world of science and medicine, what matters is not consensus, but rather testing that follows the scientific method and reproducible results.

But surely there are some quacks who should never be listened to? No doubt, but I challenge you to find a method for identifying them. Silicon Valley’s method appears to be: do what the mainstream media says, regardless of their woeful track record of fake news.

But even the “medical establishment” (if such a thing exists, given that doctors disagree about almost everything) can get it wrong. The ideas of Joseph Lister, the Victorian pioneer of antiseptic surgical techniques, were roundly mocked by the medical establishment of the day, including the world’s most prestigious medical journal, The Lancet.

It’s not hard to see why Lister was denounced. After all, he proposed pouring caustic acid on wounds! That sounds as crazy as using UV light, which can cause skin cancer and strokes, as a medical cure. And yet today, antiseptic treatments are taught in every medical textbook.

And what about Edward Jenner, the inventor of the first-ever vaccine, the one that eliminated smallpox? The establishment today love to tout their pro-vaccine credentials, but the establishment of Jenner’s day wasn’t so sure. The Royal Society, the leading scientific society in the world at the time, initially declined to publish Jenner’s paper explaining his research.

And it wasn’t until 1840 — more than four decades after Jenner began his research — that the British government rolled out his smallpox vaccines nationwide. No doubt there were more than a few people at the time who thought that Jenner’s vaccine — which involved injecting children with pus from diseased cows — sounded insane and dangerous. And yet, without the Jenner vaccine, billions of lives would have been otherwise lost to smallpox.

Now, consider this: what if, in Lister and Jenner’s day, all information was controlled by a handful of technology companies that did whatever the establishment told them? Would they have been banned as crackpots and snake-oil salesmen? It’s highly likely. From the Georgian doctor who thought injecting children with a cow virus would be a neat idea, to the 19th-century surgeon who thought to throw acid on wounds to clean them, “crackpots” have been behind more scientific and medical advances than the establishment would care to admit.

The only question is, how many cures will be stopped or delayed by Silicon Valley hyper-censorship, with its insufferable insistence that every truth and every fact is already known?

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-05,Donald Trump: CDC Study Predicting Coronavirus Death Spike Lacks Social Distancing Data,"President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday disputed a leaked Centers for Disease Control report showing that daily coronavirus deaths would spike in June.

“That’s a report with no mitigation,” Trump said as he left the White House for a trip to Arizona. “So based on no mitigation, but we’re doing a lot of mitigation.”

The New York Times leaked the CDC study on Monday, suggesting that the president was ignoring the facts about the virus while pushing the country to reopen.

The White House disputed the document on Monday, noting that it did not track with the model used by the Coronavirus Task Force.

Trump said that it was possible to open up the country again and let Americans return to work with social distancing and increased hygiene.

“The fact that they’re out, they’re mitigating, they’re social distancing, they all know that, they’re washing their hands a lot,” he said. “But we have to get our country open.”

The president also disputed the IHME model showing 134,000 deaths by August, again claiming that the data used in the model assumed no mitigation.

“Look, models have been very inaccurate, I’ve seen models that are very inaccurate,” Trump said.

But the president defended the models that predicted up to 2 million deaths in the United States without closing down the country.

“We did everything right, but now it’s time to go back to work,” he said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/donald-trump-cdc-study-predicting-coronavirus-death-spike-lacks-social-distancing-data/

Trump said that it was possible to open up the country again and let Americans return to work with social distancing and increased hygiene.

“The fact that they’re out, they’re mitigating, they’re social distancing, they all know that, they’re washing their hands a lot,” he said. “But we have to get our country open.”

The president also disputed the IHME model showing 134,000 deaths by August, again claiming that the data used in the model assumed no mitigation.

“Look, models have been very inaccurate, I’ve seen models that are very inaccurate,” Trump said.

But the president defended the models that predicted up to 2 million deaths in the United States without closing down the country.

“We did everything right, but now it’s time to go back to work,” he said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/donald-trump-cdc-study-predicting-coronavirus-death-spike-lacks-social-distancing-data/#disqus_thread
['Breitbart News'],2020-05-05,"New York: Over 1,700 Previously Undisclosed Deaths at Nursing Homes","ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities as the state faces scrutiny over how it’s protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic.

At least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state’s nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration late Monday that, for the first time, includes people believed to have been killed by the coronavirus before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test.

Exactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state’s latest disclosure, as the list doesn’t nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying.

The revised list shows that 22 nursing homes, largely in New York City and Long Island, have reported at least 40 deaths.

Parker Jewish Institute in Queens and Isabella Geriatric Center — one of New York City’s largest nursing homes with 705 beds — have reported the highest number of deaths: 71 and 64, respectively.

Audrey Waters, a spokeswoman for Isabella Geriatric Center, said in an email last week, “Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff. This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.”

In many cases, the state’s new figures reveal many more deaths than previously reported at nursing homes: Isabella Geriatric Center had 13 COVID-19 deaths reported as of May 1, and now reports the deaths of 21 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 along with 43 deaths of residents presumed to have COVID-19. And Ozanam Hall of Queens now is reporting a total of 53 deaths, up from just 10.

Several veterans home have been especially hard-hit by the virus: The Long Island State Veterans Home has reported 53 deaths; including 48 confirmed and five presumed COVID-19 deaths. The New York State Veterans Home at St. Albans in Queens has reported 33 deaths while New York State Veterans Home at Montrose in Westchester says 22 residents have died.

Cuomo promised on March 2, when only a handful of coronavirus cases had been reported in New York, to make a “special effort” for nursing homes and congregate homes housing senior citizens. The state directed nursing homes to screen visitors and consider modifying visiting hours on March 6, and later suspended visits to nursing homes statewide March 12.

But the governor is facing criticism over his administration’s role in overseeing and supporting New York’s overwhelmed, state-regulated nursing homes as many have struggled to treat COVID-19 patients, amass enough personal protective gear or ensure adequate staffing.

Advocacy groups for the elderly and family members of nursing home residents have called for greater transparency over COVID-19 cases at each state-regulated nursing home and criticized an April 1 state law granting some immunity to hospitals and nursing homes from civil and criminal liability. They also questioned the state’s March 25 policy that says “no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.”

The governor and his administration have defended that policy as ensuring nursing home residents aren’t left lingering in hospitals or without anywhere else to go. Cuomo’s spokesman tweeted Monday that the policy follows federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. But the federal guidance says only that a nursing home “can accept a resident diagnosed with COVID-19” so long as the nursing home can follow federal guidance on transmission precautions.

Cuomo has also said the state has facilities that can house transferred COVID-19 nursing homes patients, and he recently said that nursing homes that tell the state up-front that they can’t care for a COVID-19 patient wouldn’t face regulatory scrutiny. His administration hasn’t responded to a request for questions on the state’s current capacity to care for COVID-19 nursing home residents and whether nursing homes were informed.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/05/05/new-york-reports-over-1700-previously-undisclosed-deaths-at-nursing-homes/

['Katherine Rodriguez'],2020-05-05,Andrew Cuomo: Not Wearing Mask Is ‘Disrespectful’ to Frontline Workers,"Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a Sunday press briefing that people who refuse to wear a mask are being “disrespectful” to the frontline workers of the coronavirus pandemic.

“It’s disrespectful to the nurses, the doctors, the people who have been frontline workers,” the New York governor said during the briefing. “You wear the mask not for yourself, you wear the mask for me. It’s a sign of respect to other people… You know how you show love? By wearing a mask.”

“Just be responsible and show respect,” he said. “I don’t think that’s too much for each of us to ask of one another. That’s a basic common decency in this situation.”

In April, Cuomo ordered all residents to wear masks or other face coverings in public when they cannot stay at least six feet away from others in areas such as on public transit and in grocery stores.

WABC reported that Cuomo said getting outside for recreational purposes is “good” but told New Yorkers to continue to practice social distancing even as the weather grows nicer outside.

“Staying socially distant and wearing a mask are basic precautions that should keep you safe. Not as good as staying in the house, but should keep you safe,” Cuomo said Sunday.

Cuomo also took the opportunity to call out protesters recently for being “reckless” and “irresponsible” because they refused to wear masks at rallies.

The protesters, however, were frustrated with the governor for not reopening nonessential businesses, urging him to do so because of the toll the coronavirus shutdowns have taken on the state’s economy.

“I understand people’s frustration with the economy not being open. I get it. I want to see the economy open, for myself, for my family,” he said.

“I’m not going to put dollar signs over human lives. I’m not going to do that. Not for my family and not for yours. But I understand their point of view, and I understand the First Amendment. You have an argument, you’re going to make your argument, God bless America,” Cuomo continued.

['Penny Starr'],2020-05-05,Washington State Barber Opens Shop Despite Gov. Inslee’s Lockdown,"A barber who served in the United States Marine Corps decided to open his shop despite Washington Democrat Gov. Jay Inslee’s order “non-essential” businesses be shut and people stay in their homes — an order he extended on Friday to May 31.

But Martin decided he had to reopen to pay the bills.

At first, Martin served his customers in darkened premises until his supporters included the local police, Fox News reported:

He said he turned the lights and “Open” sign back on after seeing Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney’s Facebook post from last month that said he will not enforce the governor’s order because it is a violation of constitutional rights. “If they fine me, take away my license, or not renew it, I’m going to operate anyway,” Martin said. “What are you going to do now? I don’t need a piece of paper to do what I’ve been doing for 60 years.” Martin said he received support from customers who lined up outside the shop over the weekend, with some leaving extra tips and even paying double.

“I think more people are going to suffer from not being able to pay their bills than will ever suffer from the virus,” customer Eddie Donovan told the local Fox News affiliate KOMO News.

So far, 834 people in Washington state have died from the virus, according to state health department data.

“While hair salons and barbershops in states like Georgia, West Virginia, and Kansas have been allowed to reopen, shops forced to remain closed in other states are, like Martin, feeling the economic strain under the lockdown,” KOMO News reported.

Meanwhile, hair salon owner Lindsey Graham, of Salem, Ore., told FOX12 she was reopening on Tuesday for her family’s well-being, despite Democrat Gov. Kate Brown’s lockdown order.

“I’m risking going to jail to do it,” Graham said. “That’s how important it is to my family.”

Oregon state officials have said those who don’t comply with the order could face misdemeanor charges leading to a fine or even time behind bars.

Host Mike Brzezinski asked Schumer if Americans can trust the president and the government to provide “clear” and “salient information and advice” regarding the pandemic.

Schumer stressed the importance of holding hearings on Trump and the White House’s handling of the pandemic because they could bring in “experts who are not part of the government to tell the truth.”

“[T]here are certain people maybe we can trust, and that’s why we want to have hearings and that’s why we want to ask them questions,” Schumer said. “I mean, Fauci has been muzzled at times, but at times has spoken the truth. I’d say the same of Birx. If we had real hearings, we could bring in experts who are not part of the government to tell the truth.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-05,Dr. Anthony Fauci: Coronavirus Likely Wasn’t Created in Wuhan Lab,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, dismissed theories that the Chinese coronavirus was created in a laboratory in Wuhan.

“If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what’s out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated,” Fauci said in an interview with National Geographic published Monday.

“Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,” he added.

Fauci’s remarks come after Pompeo told ABC’s This Week that there was “enormous evidence” that the coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab — not a wet market.

“China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,” he explained to host Martha Raddatz. “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”

“While the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” he added.

In late April, President Trump also indicated that he had a high degree of confidence that the illness came from the Chinese lab.

“Yes. Yes, I have,” the president responded when asked if he believed the illness could have leaked from the lab. “I think that the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves, because they’re like the public relations agency for China.”

“They shouldn’t be making excuses when people make horrible mistakes, especially mistakes that are causing hundreds of thousands of people around the world to die,” he added. “I think the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves.”

On Thursday, the Office of Director of National Intelligence issued a rare statement in which it announced it does not believe that the coronavirus was genetically modified.

“The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,” said the top U.S. spy agency. “The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”

The Associated Press reported Sunday that China “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in January in order to hoard medical supplies, according to a Department of Homeland Security intelligence report.

['Jeff Poor'],2020-05-05,Cotton: All Evidence Points to Coronavirus Coming from Wuhan Labs,"Tuesday during an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) argued the COVID-19 virus could be a product of the lab but, at the same time, “naturally occurring.”

Over the past few weeks, critics have been dismissive of claims coronavirus could be a product of a lab in China. However, Cotton points out there is a lack of evidence it originated from the wet markets, as many have claimed.

“All the evidence at this point points to two labs in Wuhan,” Cotton said. “No evidence — and I mean no evidence at all points to the seafood market in Wuhan. Now, all the evidence pointing to those labs, the fact that they used bats, that they research coronaviruses, that they have a history of bad safety practices, that the original person infected with the virus had no contact with the food market, all of that is circumstantial evidence to be sure. But in intelligence questions, we rarely get direct or conclusive evidence. So I agree that all of the evidence, albeit circumstantial, points directly at those labs. And if the Chinese Communist Party has evidence to the contrary, they need to bring it forward to the world.”

According to Cotton, just because the virus emerged from the lab does not mean it was “genetically modified or engineered.”

“Whether the virus was genetically modified or engineered is a highly technical, scientific question. And the weight of scientific opinion right now says that, no, this was a naturally occurring virus. But a naturally occurring virus can, of course, be present in a laboratory where it’s being studied. That is a different question from saying that laboratory might have had bad safety practices, and there could have been an accidental breach, which was the original source of what has become this terrible pandemic.”

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,Gavin Newsom: California Can Begin to Reopen Economy on Friday,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the state may begin to reopen its economy Friday, entering the next phase of his recovery plan.

According to “Stage 1” of the plan, retail stores will be able to offer curbside pickup, and there may be further allowances as the state makes progress in reducing coronavirus cases.

The governor “announced that bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, sporting goods stores and other retailers can reopen for curbside service Friday under new guidelines to be announced later this week,” the San Diego Union-Tribune reported, adding: “State officials cautioned that office buildings, shopping malls and restaurant dining rooms will not be reopened Friday, but later on in Stage 2.”

Certain urban areas, such as the six counties forming the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles County, may take longer to reopen, either because of state concerns or because of more restrictive local decisions.

The San Francisco Chronicle noted: “Six Bay Area counties are under a stay-at-home order through the end of May that is separate from the state’s shutdown, and Newsom said such counties could keep their stricter rules in place past Friday if they choose.”

San Diego County is also finalizing its own regulations, which require businesses to provide personal protective equipment and to implement social distancing guidelines, the Union-Tribune noted.

Some counties with few coronavirus cases had already begun to defy statewide orders. Newsom declined to tell reporters on his daily conference call Monday whether he would punish those counties, Calmatters reported.

The state will also develop an “army” of “contact tracers,” Calmatters added, who will be “public health workers tasked with tracking down people exposed to the virus so they can safely self-isolate and prevent the disease from spreading.”

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said that he did not expect Los Angeles to reopen on Friday. “Our timing on opening may vary from other parts of the state,” he said, the Los Angeles Times reported.

On Monday, the City of Laguna Beach reached a deal with Gov. Newsom to reopen its beaches in four phases. Newsom had ordered a “hard close” of Orange County beaches last week over concerns about overcrowding.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,Gavin Newsom: California Can Begin to Reopen Economy on Friday,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the state may begin to reopen its economy Friday, entering the next phase of his recovery plan.

According to “Stage 1” of the plan, retail stores will be able to offer curbside pickup, and there may be further allowances as the state makes progress in reducing coronavirus cases.

The governor “announced that bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, sporting goods stores and other retailers can reopen for curbside service Friday under new guidelines to be announced later this week,” the San Diego Union-Tribune reported, adding: “State officials cautioned that office buildings, shopping malls and restaurant dining rooms will not be reopened Friday, but later on in Stage 2.”

Certain urban areas, such as the six counties forming the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles County, may take longer to reopen, either because of state concerns or because of more restrictive local decisions.

The San Francisco Chronicle noted: “Six Bay Area counties are under a stay-at-home order through the end of May that is separate from the state’s shutdown, and Newsom said such counties could keep their stricter rules in place past Friday if they choose.”

San Diego County is also finalizing its own regulations, which require businesses to provide personal protective equipment and to implement social distancing guidelines, the Union-Tribune noted.

Some counties with few coronavirus cases had already begun to defy statewide orders. Newsom declined to tell reporters on his daily conference call Monday whether he would punish those counties, Calmatters reported.

The state will also develop an “army” of “contact tracers,” Calmatters added, who will be “public health workers tasked with tracking down people exposed to the virus so they can safely self-isolate and prevent the disease from spreading.”

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said that he did not expect Los Angeles to reopen on Friday. “Our timing on opening may vary from other parts of the state,” he said, the Los Angeles Times reported.

On Monday, the City of Laguna Beach reached a deal with Gov. Newsom to reopen its beaches in four phases. Newsom had ordered a “hard close” of Orange County beaches last week over concerns about overcrowding.

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-05,"Philadelphia Reports Zero Coronavirus Deaths, First Day Since March","Philadelphia reported zero coronavirus deaths on Monday, marking the first day the city reported no deaths since March 24.

Health officials reported no new coronavirus fatalities in Philadelphia while adding 186 new cases of the virus, signaling a positive trend for the city.

“We’ve been through some tough times in this epidemic, but over the weekend the situation here in Philadelphia is starting to look better,” Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Tom Farley said, according to WHYY:

Philadelphia reported no new deaths caused by COVID-19 on Monday and just 186 new cases. City officials say it’s a hopeful trend.https://t.co/dhVwYpQfP0 — WHYY News (@WHYYNews) May 4, 2020

Monday also marked the third consecutive day the city saw less than 400 new coronavirus cases. Farley said the city’s total now stands at 16,040 positive cases.

“While the daily count has remained low over the past few days, some labs do not report results over the weekend, and the City has not yet received all backlogged results,” the health department added in a press release.

Additionally, the city’s death toll dropped to 726 after officials removed one of the coronavirus-related deaths over the weekend.

The drop in Philadelphia’s fatality rate follows last month’s controversy regarding inconsistent numbers on the state’s overall death count. The state saw two spikes in its death count followed by a decrease within the span of the week — a phenomenon health officials attributed to lags in reporting and the inclusion and subsequent removal of “probable” coronavirus deaths.

As Breitbart News reported:

According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the inconsistencies began on Sunday after the Health Department raised the death total by 276 overnight, bringing the total to 1,112. The death total saw another significant jump on Tuesday, going from 1,204 to 1,564 in a single day, giving the false impression of a surge in recent deaths. Health Secretary Rachel Levine clarified this week that the spikes were not reflective of current information, attributing the bumps to a computer glitch, a general lag in initial reporting (counting deaths that occurred weeks ago, in some cases), and the addition of “probable positive” deaths.

Pennsylvania had 50,092 confirmed cases of the virus and 2,458 related deaths as of Tuesday morning, according to the state’s department of health.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/philadelphia-reports-zero-coronavirus-deaths-first-day-since-march/

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-04,VA Gov. Northam to Extend Closure of Nonessential Businesses to May 15,"Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced on Monday that he is extending his executive order shutting down businesses deemed “nonessential” until May 14.

All nonessential businesses will remain closed for at least another week, Northam said on Monday. He extended the original order, which was set to expire this week, and extended it even further on Monday, through May 14.

However, he said he hopes the state can begin to move into the first phase of reopening next week, as early as Friday, May 15. Under Phase I, social gatherings are limited to groups no larger than ten, social distancing and teleworking remains in place, face coverings are recommended in public, and restrictions on businesses and religious gatherings are lessened.

Northam said:

Here’s the bottom line. You’ll be able to get your hair cut, but you’ll need an appointment. And you’ll see new safety measures in the salon. It means you can go out to eat again. But restaurants will use less of their seating so to spread people out more. Employees will wear face coverings and they’ll do more cleaning. Phase I means more retail establishments can be open. But they’ll have to operate at lower capacity. You can go to the gym, but with fewer people and more requirements for cleaning.

Phase II expands social gatherings, limiting them to 50 people. Social distancing and teleworking will remain in tact, face coverings will continue to be encouraged, and additional restrictions on businesses will be relaxed. Both phases could last 2-4 weeks “or longer,” according to the governor.

Phase III will remove limits to capacity in businesses and social gatherings and encourage “Safer at Home” for vulnerable populations. However, the final phase will require “no evidence of a rebound” of the virus “for a sustained period of time.” The final phase could be “10-12 weeks away, or more,” according to the slides provided by the governor during his Monday press conference.

Residents flocked to Virginia state’s capital last month to protest Northam’s “draconian, autocratic, administrative orders.”

“Just like the serpent deceived Eve in the garden, I believe that Northam has a great deal of Virginians deceived — that he’s doing a good job and that he truly has their best interest at heart,” Virginia resident James Delong, who attended the Reopen Virginia rally last month, told Breitbart News.

“I don’t believe that at all. I believe he’s a tyrant. I believe President Trump said it best, you know, when he said ‘Liberate Virginia.’ Without liberty, we have nothing,” he added:

['John Nolte'],2020-05-04,Rich McHugh Says AP Didn't Catch Tara Reade Changing Her Story,"Investigative reporter Rich McHugh says the Associated Press (AP) did not catch Tara Reade changing her story about the harassment complaint she says she filed against then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) in 1993.

In an effort to discredit and humiliate Reade, who alleges Biden harassed her, assaulted her, and then fired her in retaliation over her filing a complaint, the Associated Press made it sound as though Reade has changed her story about the compliant.

This is not true. Reade has not changed her story.

The AP told the world Saturday that “Tara Reade says a Senate report she filed against Joe Biden didn’t refer to sexual harassment or assault.”

If that were true, this would obviously be a big deal. Reade’s claim that she filed a complaint against Biden is the next step of the story, especially when Biden is refusing to release his Senate records from the University of Delaware, which is where any complaint is likely to be found.

The allegation from the AP, and a number of Biden supporters who have embraced the AP story, is that this report from the AP proves Reade is changing and embellishing her story.

You see, the AP interviewed Reade in 2019, way last year, and rather than report on the story at the time, the AP sat on the story until this weekend when it could frame its 2019 interview with her in a way that would suggest Reade changed her story about the complaint she filed.

But she has not changed her story, and two investigative reporters back her up on that fact.

Regardless, the AP and Biden’s defenders are still playing a deeply cynical and dishonest semantics game. Let me explain…

First off, Reade has never claimed she filed an official Senate complaint about Biden’s alleged sexual assault. (Under penalty of prison, Reade did file a criminal complaint earlier this year.) While five witnesses have come forward to confirm Reade told them about the assault at or near the time she said it happened, she has only ever said she filed a Senate complaint about Biden’s alleged harassment.

So there is no inconsistency in Reade’s statements about the nature of the complaint she says she filed.

The semantics game comes from the fact that Reade says she did not use the specific words “sexual harassment” in her complaint.

People are embracing this fact as though it matters.

But the fact Reade did not use the specific words “sexual harassment” in her complaint does not matter, because the behavior she says she described in the complaint is sexual harassment.

This is made clear in the AP’s own story:

“I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,” Reade said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press. “I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.” Reade told the AP twice that she did not use the phrase “sexual harassment” in filing the complaint, but at other points in the interview said that was the behavior she believed she was describing. She said: “I talked about sexual harassment, retaliation. The main word I used – and I know I didn’t use sexual harassment — I used ‘uncomfortable.’ And I remember ‘retaliation.’”

No fair-minded person — or news organization — would make an issue out the fact she did not use the specific words “sexual harassment” in a complaint when the behavior she says she described in the complaint is an obvious, textbook case of sexual harassment — most especially the part about “retaliation.”

The AP continued its word games with this:

But Reade is suggesting that even if the report surfaces, it would not corroborate her assault allegations because she chose not to detail them at the time.

That is meant to sound as though it’s some kind of new revelation, as though Reade told the AP in 2019 that — if found — the complaint will not back up her assault allegation, but in the year since she has been claiming it would corroborate the assault allegation. But the truth is that she has never said or insinuated any such thing. She has only ever claimed she filed a complaint about the harassment, not the alleged assault.

Because I care about facts and am aware of them, long before this weekend AP report came out — which is obviously meant to muddy the waters of those who have not followed the story closely, I have only ever referred to Reade’s official complaint as a “harassment complaint,” never an assault complaint. Why? Because, despite what the AP wants you to believe, Reade has always been clear on that point.

Finally, investigative reporter Rich McHugh, who has interviewed Reade a number of times this year, says that what Reade told the AP is consistent with Reade has told him:

This is consistent with what she told me about the complaint as well. https://t.co/0zd1mxzpG5 — Rich McHugh (@RichMcHugh) May 3, 2020

Once again, what we are seeing, courtesy of fake news outlets like the Associated Press, is a disturbing re-enactment of what the corporate media and Democrats did to smear and discredit Bill Clinton’s credible accusers during the 1990s.

This absurd and dishonest hair-splitting about “sexual harassment” is a perfect example of what the media did to attack and besmirch Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Monica Lewinsky, and Juanita Broaddrick 20 years ago — all in an effort to protect Bill Clinton.

Over and over again in the 90s, the media and Democrats aligned to launch campaigns of personal destruction against these women, and they did so with the exact same sleight-of-hand dishonesty we just saw from the AP.

This behavior from the media is as despicable as it is predictable.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) reportedly said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden’s denial of sexual assault allegations brought forth by former Senate staffer Tara Reade was “credible and convincing.”

“I saw the reports of what Ms. Reade said, I saw an interview with Vice President Biden. I appreciate that the vice president took a lot of questions, tough questions. And he answered them directly and respectfully,” Warren stated, according to CNN congressional reporter Manu Raju.

“The vice president’s answers were credible and convincing,” she added.

Biden, the presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, publically addressed Reade’s claims for the first time in a Friday interview with MSNBC’s Morning Joe. The former staff assistant to Biden alleges that the then-senator sexually assaulted her while the two were in the basement of a Capitol Hill building in the mid-1990s.

“It is not true. I’m saying it unequivocally – it never happened. It didn’t. It never happened,” Biden told co-host Mika Brzezinski.

Warren also reiterated her support for Biden’s White House bid, saying: “I support the vice president, I support his campaign, and I’m proud to endorse him for president.”

President Trump said in a Tuesday interview with the New York Post that the former vice president “owes” the Massachusetts Democrat to be picked as his running mate.

“I think Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Joe Biden’s win because she didn’t drop out and Bernie would have won every single state on Super Tuesday,” the president explained.

“If he’s gonna win — and I don’t know that he makes it to the starting gate — but if he does make it to the starting gate, [Warren is] responsible,” he added.

Other possible vice presidential picks, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) and activist Stacey Abrams, have also expressed support for Biden against Reade’s allegations.

['Kyle Olson'],2020-05-04,Gretchen Whitmer Mimics Biden Campaign Talking Points on Tara Reade,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stuck closely to the Biden campaign script when asked about allegations made by Tara Reade.

Whitmer was asked by CNN host Jake Tapper about her reaction to the accusation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted Reade in 1993.

She replied:

As a survivor, and as a feminist, I’ll say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. Then we have a duty to vet it. And just because you’re a survivor doesn’t mean that every claim is equal. It means we give them the ability to make their case and the other side as well. And then to make a judgment that is informed. I have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I’ve watched his defense. There’s not a pattern that goes into this. And I think for these reasons, I’m very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is.

In April, the Biden campaign circulated talking points to its surrogates and supporters so they would play down the accusations and vouch for Biden’s credibility.

“Biden believes that all women have the right to be heard and to have their claims thoroughly reviewed,” they read.

The document continued in part: “…this alleged conduct would have been so wildly out of character for Joe Biden.”

“There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him – ever,” the talking points said.

Whitmer wouldn’t be the first Democrat to use those talking points.

During an appearance on CNN, Stacey Abrams made similar comments.

“I believe that women deserve to be heard and I believe that they need to be listened to, but I also believe that those allegations have to be investigated by credible sources,” she said.

“I believe Joe Biden. I believe that he is a person who has demonstrated that his love of family, his love of our community has been made perfectly clear through his work as a congressional leader and as an American leader,” Abrams added.

“I know Joe Biden, and I think that he is telling the truth and that this did not happen.”

Like Whitmer, Abrams is also believed to be vying to be Biden’s vice-presidential running mate.

['Kyle Olson'],2020-05-04,Gretchen Whitmer Mimics Biden Campaign Talking Points on Tara Reade,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stuck closely to the Biden campaign script when asked about allegations made by Tara Reade.

Whitmer was asked by CNN host Jake Tapper about her reaction to the accusation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted Reade in 1993.

She replied:

As a survivor, and as a feminist, I’ll say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. Then we have a duty to vet it. And just because you’re a survivor doesn’t mean that every claim is equal. It means we give them the ability to make their case and the other side as well. And then to make a judgment that is informed. I have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I’ve watched his defense. There’s not a pattern that goes into this. And I think for these reasons, I’m very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is.

In April, the Biden campaign circulated talking points to its surrogates and supporters so they would play down the accusations and vouch for Biden’s credibility.

“Biden believes that all women have the right to be heard and to have their claims thoroughly reviewed,” they read.

The document continued in part: “…this alleged conduct would have been so wildly out of character for Joe Biden.”

“There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him – ever,” the talking points said.

Whitmer wouldn’t be the first Democrat to use those talking points.

During an appearance on CNN, Stacey Abrams made similar comments.

“I believe that women deserve to be heard and I believe that they need to be listened to, but I also believe that those allegations have to be investigated by credible sources,” she said.

“I believe Joe Biden. I believe that he is a person who has demonstrated that his love of family, his love of our community has been made perfectly clear through his work as a congressional leader and as an American leader,” Abrams added.

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-05,Fact Check: AOC Says Support Biden Because We've ‘Had Kids in Cages',"CLAIM: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said during an April appearance on The View that Democrats must rally behind Joe Biden (D), the Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee, because it is an issue of “life and death,” stating, “We have had kids in cages.”

VERDICT: The “cages” Democrats frequently refer to — chain-link enclosures in certain border facilities — were set up during the Obama-Biden administration, virtually diminishing one of the main reasons Ocasio-Cortez believes it is important for Democrats to support Biden.

Ocasio-Cortez appealed to the false left-wing talking point during an April 15 appearance on the The View in response to cohost Whoopi Goldberg, who asked the lawmaker, “Do you think it’s time to have a conversation with Joe?”

“Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, I think right now just the stakes are too high when it comes to another four years of Trump,” Ocasio-Cortez said, stating that her community “especially” has been impacted.

“And it’s, you know, for a lot of communities, this is an issue of life and death. We have had kids in cages,” she claimed, also criticizing the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I think it’s really important that we rally behind our Democratic nominee in November,” she added:

Despite Ocasio-Cortez’s insinuation, the “cages” she and her Democrat allies consistently refer to were constructed during the Obama-Biden administration — not President Trump’s. Even Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security during the Obama-Biden administration, admitted that existing structures were not invented at the start of Trump’s term.

“Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on January 20, 2017, OK?” Johnson said during an appearance at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year, responding to the viral 2014 photo depicting the controversial holding facilities:

Johnson continued:

But during that 72-hour period, when you have something that is a multiple — like four times — of what you’re accustomed to in the existing infrastructure, you’ve got to find places quickly to put kids. You can’t just dump seven-year-old kids on the streets of McAllen or El Paso. And so these facilities were erected.

Biden has also denied the Obama administration’s role in constructing the “cages,” telling Univision’s Jorge Ramos in September, “We didn’t lock people up in cages.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Biden claimed that the Obama administration’s policies were more humane than those of President Donald Trump: “We didn’t lock people up in cages,” he said. In fact, the “cages” were built by the Obama administration to deal with a surge of unaccompanied minors who crossed the border illegally in 2014. Originally, the Obama administration was “warehousing” children — literally — in overwhelmed Border Patrol facilities. Breitbart News broke the story of the surge, which was partly triggered by Obama’s policy of allowing illegal alien children who entered the country as minors to stay in the country (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA).

Even PolitiFact deemed it “inaccurate” for Biden to claim that Obama’s administration did not put people in “cages,” and left-wing Snopes rated the claim “The Obama administration, not the Trump administration, built the cages that hold many immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border” as “true.”

Ocasio-Cortez has a history of making controversial statements regarding migrant detention centers, setting off a political firestorm last summer after accusing the Trump administration of running “concentration camps.”

“That is exactly what they are. They are concentration camps,” Ocasio-Cortez said of migrant detention centers during an Instagram Live last June.

“The fact that concentrations camps are now an institutionalized practice in the Home of the Free is extraordinarily disturbing, and we need to do something about it,” she added.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/fact-check-ocasio-cortez-says-democrats-must-rally-behind-biden-because-we-have-had-kids-in-cages/

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-05,Trump: Biden Obligated to Choose ‘Pocahontas’ Warren for Vice President,"President Donald Trump on Monday said that former Vice President Joe Biden was obligated to choose Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) as his running mate.

“She was responsible for his win, so, therefore, I think he owes an obligation to pick Pocahontas,” he said in an interview with the New York Post, referring to Warren.

Trump recalled that Warren refused to drop out before Super Tuesday, further splitting the far-left vote that would have helped Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

“I think Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Joe Biden’s win because she didn’t drop out and Bernie would have won every single state on Super Tuesday,” Trump said.

The president argued that Warren essentially saved Biden’s struggling campaign.

“I think he should pick Elizabeth Warren because Elizabeth Warren, more than any other person, including Jim Clyburn and including anybody you can name, is responsible for the win of Joe Biden,” Trump said.

The president said that Stacey Abrams was not a good choice for vice president, recalling that she lost her 2018 race for Georgia governor even with the help of Barack and Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.

“They were there all the time campaigning for Stacey Abrams, their new great star. That didn’t work out too well,” he said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/donald-trump-joe-biden-obligated-to-choose-pocahontas-elizabeth-warren-for-vice-president/

['Kyle Olson'],2020-05-04,Biden: Coronavirus an Opportunity to 'Fundamentally Transform' America,"Joe Biden echoed Barack Obama’s 2008 promise to “fundamentally transform” America on Monday when he vowed to use the coronavirus outbreak to alter the country.

Joe Biden calls coronavirus an “incredible opportunity…to fundamentally transform the country” Make no mistake: Joe Biden is the bannerman for the radical socialist wing of the Democrat Party. Biden and Bernie are two sides of the same far left coin.pic.twitter.com/RKiLqdy3pm — Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) May 4, 2020

“And I truly think, if we do this right, we have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis, but to fundamentally transform the country,” Biden told a group of Latino supporters during a livestream.

It’s not the first time Biden has talked about leveraging the crisis to advance progressive policies.

He said April 22nd:

I believe, because, sort of, the blinders have been taken off, because of this COVID crisis, I think people are realizing, “My Lord. Look at what is possible. Look at the institutional changes we can make – without us becoming a ‘socialist country,’ or any of that malarkey – that we can make to provide the opportunities to change the institutional drawbacks …” from education, all the way through to all the other things we talked about.

On April 17th, Biden said, “We have an opportunity now to take, in a recovery act, a real recovery. We can fundamentally change the science relating to global warming.”

And on April 16th, he said, “I think we have an opportunity now to significantly change the mindset of the American people, things they weren’t ready to do, even two, three years ago,” all thanks to the virus.

The first vow to “fundamentally transform” the country came from Barack Obama in 2008.

“We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America,” Obama told a cheering throng of supporters at the University of Missouri shortly before the election.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-04,Democrat Operatives Launch ‘Committee to Draft Michelle Obama’ for VP,"A newly-launched committee called “Draft Michelle Obama” is pushing for Joe Biden, the apparent Democrat presidential nominee, to select the former first lady as his running mate.

“Joe Biden has said he would choose Michelle Obama as his running mate ‘in a heartbeat.’ The aim of this campaign is to build on the substantial grassroots support for a potential Michelle Obama candidacy and help garner media attention for a vice-presidential nominee who has the power to beat Donald Trump,” the group said in a statement released Monday.

The statement adds: “The Committee to Draft Michelle Obama firmly believes that Ms. Obama will not only benefit the Democratic ticket this November but also help lead this country to be more just and caring. However strongly we support Ms. Obama as Vice President Biden’s running mate, we will transfer our resolve to whoever joins the ticket to defeat the most dangerous incumbent in the history of our nation.”

The group, which filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in late April, is supported by Democratic fundraisers Nadine Hack and Mack Wilbourn, spokesperson Drew Zuckerman told The Hill.

Biden has said he would undoubtedly pick Obama to be his running mate, affirming in an April interview that he would “take her in a heartbeat.”

“She’s brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman. The Obamas are great friends,” the former vice president told CBS Pittsburgh.

Days later, former second lady Jill Biden echoed her husband’s praise of Obama, stating that she would make a “wonderful” vice president.

Though Democrats think Obama would boost lagging enthusiasm plaguing Biden’s candidacy, members of the former first lady’s circle say the move will never happen. Former White House official Valerie Jarrett recently poured cold water on the idea, saying there is “no chance” she would agree to run.

“The reason why I’m being so unequivocal is that there just simply has never been a time when she’s expressed an interest in running for office,” Jarrett told The Hill. “She’s not demurring here. She’s not being hard to get. She doesn’t want the job.”

The Biden campaign is currently vetting several women as potential running mates, including failed White House candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Also under consideration are Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and progressive activist Stacy Abrams (D).

According to the FBI, there were 2,911,128 background checks conducted in April 2020. The closest any other April came to that figure was in 2019, when 2,334, 294 NICS checks were done.

April’s surge in background checks followed a March that shattered all one-month records. Breitbart News reported March 2020 witnessed 3,740,688 background checks, which were the most checks conducted in any single month since the inception of NICS.

The March and April surge came amid an unprecedented run on guns and ammunition during the issuance of coronavirus shutdowns, coupled with doomsday scenarios with civil unrest.

On March 19, 2020, Breitbart News quoted Kyle Olsen, owner of Arizona’s Olsen Firearms, saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this.”

He noted that the sales surge eclipsed what his store witnessed in January 2013, a time when Joe Biden was pushing numerous post-Sandy Hook gun controls for Barack Obama.

['Awr Hawkins'],2020-05-05,Poll: Americans Oppose Reopening Gun and Clothing Stores,"A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll shows 70 percent of Americans oppose reopening gun stores at this point in the coronavirus recovery process, and 69 percent oppose reopening clothing and other retail stores.

The Post reported the poll, conducted April 28–May 3, which also showed opposition to opening dine-in restaurants, gyms, golf courses, and nail salons.

The poll found that “67 percent [of Americans] say they would be uncomfortable shopping at a retail clothing store, and 78 percent would be uncomfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant.”

The Post-University of Maryland poll also found that Americans “give President Trump negative marks for his response to the outbreak” but “overwhelmingly approve” of doctors like Anthony S. Fauci.

A closer look at poll respondents shows more identified as Democrats than Republicans. Moreover, opposition to reopening gun and retail stores, golf courses, etc., was driven by Democrats.

For example, 61 percent of Republican respondents are ready to reopen golf courses, versus 30 percent of Democrats. Forty-nine percent of Republicans are ready to reopen gun stores, versus 14 percent of Democrats. Fifty-three percent of Republicans are ready to reopen clothing and other retail stores, versus 21 percent of Democrats.

The poll was conducted by telephone among 1,005 adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

['Awr Hawkins'],2020-05-04,Biden Enjoys Armed Protection While Fighting to Disarm Americans,"Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden is enjoying the benefit of armed protection while campaigning on a platform of disarming his fellow Americans.

On March 17, 2020, Breitbart News reported Biden began receiving Secret Service protection. Not only does this mean he is surrounded by good guys 24 hours a day, but it also means he is protected with the very guns he is trying to take from average Americans.

For example, a source told Breitbart News the Secret Service will protect Biden with pistols, semiautomatic rifles–perhaps ARs and/or Sig Sauer MCX platform firearms–and that fully automatic firearms will most like be part of the equation too. The full-auto firearms often consist of submachine guns on a sling, which allows them to be carried out of sight under a jacket or coat.

Ironically, Biden is campaigning on banning the average man from owning rifles such as AR-15s, AK-47s, and Sig Sauer MCXs.

On August 6, 2019, Real Clear Politics posted video of CNN’s Anderson Cooper asking Biden, “So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they’re going to come for guns?”

Biden answered, “Bingo. You’re right, if you have an ‘assault weapon.’ The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.”

He added:

Look, the Second Amendment doesn’t say you can’t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own. You can’t buy a bazooka. You can’t have a flame thrower. The guys who make these arguments are the people who say the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots; we need the protection against the government. We need an F-15 for that. We need something well beyond whether or not you’re going to have an “assault weapon.”

But Biden is protected by the very weapons he says “should be illegal, period.” Moreover, he was protected by them during his eight years as vice president to Barack Obama.

When is the last time Joe Biden went out in public without armed security? But yet he doesn’t want you to be able to defend yourself and your family. He’s an out of touch elitist hypocrite. 📸: @bennyjohnson pic.twitter.com/1tNVZp3Z3D — NRA (@NRA) May 4, 2020

Also, the Secret Service is using standard-sized magazines in their rifles, i.e., which means 30 rounds. But Biden is campaigning to ban average Americans from having “20, 30, 40, 50 clips in a weapon.”

The bottom line–Biden lives behind layers of safety bolstered by guns that he says “should be illegal, period.” He is enjoying the benefits of those guns while working hard to be sure average Americans cannot own them.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-05,"Ohio U. Lays Off Gender, Race Studies Professors","Ohio University laid off three professors from the gender and race studies departments this week in response to financial burdens imposed by the Chinese virus pandemic. Ohio University also fired 140 unionized employees who worked in the university’s custodial, groundskeeping, and maintenance departments.

According to a report by the College Fix, Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, laid off three professors this week in response to financial difficulties imposed on the university by the ongoing pandemic. The now jobless faculty members were part of the gender and race studies departments.

The university has already been criticized for its decision to lay off faculty from the gender and race studies departments. Ohio University political science professor Kirstine Taylor wrote in a viral tweet that she was “heart-sick” over the university’s decision.

This morning Ohio University started laying off tenure-track faculty, starting with African American Studies. I am heart-sick. And I worry that this is the canary in the coal mine for other universities. Are any other institutions doing this? — Kirstine Taylor (@kirstinetaylor) May 1, 2020

Ohio University spokesperson Carly Leatherwood said that faculty salaries are the university’s largest expense. “The majority of the institution’s operational costs are in its employees, which requires the university to make extremely difficult decisions regarding our workforce, including today’s action,” Leatherwood said.

Over 3,000 members of the Ohio University community have signed a petition that calls on the university to reinstate the professors. “Entire academic programs, including African-American Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies are facing elimination. Faculty have been excluded almost entirely from the decision-making process,” the petition reads.

On Monday, the American Association of University Professors Ohio University Chapter released a statement in which it condemned the university’s decision. The group argued that the decision could “destroy” the university’s commitment to “diversity and inclusion.”

“Further, the ostensible decision not to renew the three faculty members in Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and in African American Studies will irremediably weaken or destroy programs that directly support diversity and inclusion, one of Ohio University’s primary institutional commitments,” the statement read. “These terminations must be reversed and there must be a halt to any further personnel decisions.”

Breitbart News reported in May 2018 that the Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion at Ohio University makes almost $200,000 per year. By comparison, the average full professor at a public university earns $126,000 per year.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-05,Department of Education Investigates U. of Portland for Feminist Student Club Excluding Whites,"The University of Portland is facing an investigation by the Department of Education over the exclusion of white students and faculty from a feminist student organization. The investigation is the result of a complaint by University of Michigan-Flint Professor Mark J. Perry who alleged that the practice constitutes a violation of Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race and color.

According to a report by The College Fix, the University of Portland is facing an investigation by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights over a student organization called the “Feminist of Color Collective” which excludes white students from its meetings. The group also regularly excludes male students from its meetings.

The complaint was filed by University of Michigan-Flint economist Mark J. Perry. Perry has filed Title IX complaints against universities and colleges against the country. Breitbart News reported in February 2018 that Perry filed a civil rights complaint against Stanford University after it instituted a policy that banned male students from the gym at certain times during the week. Perry has filed 129 complaints about sex discrimination at American universities and colleges to the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. 71 of Perry’s 129 complaints have resulted in investigations.

In an email to the Seattle office of the Department of Education, Perry argued that the feminist organization’s exclusion of white students constituted a Title VI violation.

Portland State University (PSU) is a public university that receives federal financial assistance and is therefore required to enforce Title VI’s prohibition of discrimination based on race and color. PSU is a public university in the state of Oregon and under the jurisdiction of your office. Therefore, I am requesting that the Seattle OCR investigate PSU for violating Title VI for the following discriminatory program as described in the photo of a flyer below that was publicized on Twitter by assistant professor of philosophy at Portland State University Peter Boghossian.

The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights confirmed this week that it is investigating the University of Portland over its support of the “Feminist of Color Collective.”

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-05,House Republicans Launch Probe Into China’s Influence on American Universities,"Republicans in the House of Representatives announced this week that they have launched an investigation into China’s influence on American universities and colleges. Many universities and colleges have cut ties with the Chinese government’s Confucius Institute over concerns that it sought to limit criticism of China on American campuses.

According to a report by Fox News, Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives have launched a probe into China’s efforts to infiltrate American colleges and universities.

In a letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Republican lawmakers wrote that they are concerned that the Chinese government is using American universities and colleges to indoctrinate students.

“We cannot allow a dangerous communist regime to buy access to our institutions of higher education, plain and simple,” Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH) said.

The letter, which was signed by leaders of the House Committee on Education and Labor, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, House Armed Services Committee, House Committee on Homeland Security, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and House Foreign Affairs Committee, asks DeVos to aid them in their investigation of China’s influence on American universities and colleges.

“For some time, we have been concerned about the potential for the Chinese government to use its strategic investments to turn American college campuses into indoctrination platforms for American students,” the letter reads.

The letter expresses concern that the Chinese government has exerted influence on American campuses through the Confucius Institute, an organization backed by the Chinese government that partners with American institutions to teach Chinese language and culture. However, many universities and colleges have severed ties with the Confucius Institute over concerns that it was designed to limit criticism of the Chinese government on American campuses.

“For example, a 2018 Hoover Institution report notes the presence of some 110 ‘Confucius Institutes’ on college campuses as well as over 500 ‘Confucius Classrooms’ in secondary schools,” the letter continues. “While the stated mission of such institutes and classrooms is to teach Chinese language and culture, the report notes, ‘faculty and other watchdogs have warned that they may present risks to intellectual freedom by using American universities as vehicles through which to advance Chinese Communist Party propaganda.'”

Breitbart News reported in January that Harvard University Chemistry Chairman Charles Lieber had been charged with fraud over his private financial relationship with the Chinese government. Lieber was paid millions of dollars by the Chinese government to work on “collaborative projects” between Harvard and the Chinese government.

['Bob Price'],2020-05-05,102 Migrants Apprehended in Tractor-Trailers at Texas Checkpoint in a Week,"Laredo Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended another 54 migrants locked in a tractor-trailer rig. The arrest occurred at an interior immigration checkpoint located about 70 miles north of the Texas-Mexico border.

Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials noted the apprehension is part of an increasing trend where cartel-connected human smugglers dangerously lock illegal immigrants in the rear of a tractor-trailer. The migrants are locked in with little-to-no air circulation, no bathroom facilities, and no means of escape in the event of abandonment by the smugglers or a crash.

Laredo North Station agents assigned to the Interstate 35 Immigration Checkpoint observed a white tractor-trailer rig approaching for inspection on Monday morning, according to information provided by Laredo Sector officials. During an initial screening, a K-9 alerted to an odor near the rear of the trailer it is trained to detect. The agents directed the driver to a secondary inspection station.

During a physical search of the trailer, agents found 54 people, including two juveniles, locked inside the hot trailer. The photo provided by CBP officials shows the cramped conditions and the danger posed by the heavy-tire cargo that would slide around in an emergency stop or crash.

Agents identified the 54 migrants as having traveled to the United States from Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. The agents placed the driver and his passenger, both U.S. citizens, in custody pending an investigation to be conducted by Homeland Security Investigations special agents.

In less than a week, Laredo Sector officials apprehended 102 migrants who were being smuggled in tractor-trailers at this single checkpoint.

“As temperatures rise, the Laredo Sector continues to see an increase in the number of individuals willing to put their lives in danger by being smuggled.,” Laredo Sector officials stated.

During an interview with Breitbart Texas in April, Laredo Sector Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez said smuggling in tractor-trailers is up significantly this fiscal year.

During the first seven months of Fiscal Year 2020, which began on October 1, 2019, Laredo Sector agents apprehended 1,071 migrants in motor-vehicle related incidents. This is up from 669 during the same period in FY19, the chief said. The use of tractors increased by 38 percent when compared to the previous year.

Chavez stressed that illegally crossing the border and the entire human smuggling process is very dangerous. He cited the callous treatment of migrants by the Mexican cartels and others engaged in the human smuggling process.

“They have no respect for human life,” the chief said, “even during the COVID-19 pandemic. To them, these people are nothing more than human cargo.”

The incident occurred on Monday afternoon in Tula, Hidalgo, just north from Mexico City. The unnamed victim was being treated at the hospital, information released by health officials stated. Video of the action circulated on some local social media accounts.

A prepared statement from the Tula Hospital revealed that the patient began to show symptoms on April 27 and sought medical attention on May 1. The patient was not listed in serious condition and was showing signs of improvement when he went missing. Officials closed the hospital for a search and found the patient on the third floor before the deadly jump.

The suicide comes as health officials say that the number of Coronavirus cases continue to rise. The latest figures show almost 25,000 confirmed cases since the pandemic started with 2,271 fatalities.

"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']",2020-05-05,Drones Outfitted with Explosives Seized in Mexico in ‘Active Terrorism Investigation’,"Authorities seized drones outfitted with makeshift explosive devices in central Mexico as part of an active terrorism investigation.

Drones fitted with C4 and other explosives were found in stash houses in the state of Puebla. On April 22, the Office of Mexico’s Attorney General received an anonymous tip about organized criminal activity that could lead to potential acts of terror.

On April 25, authorities obtained search warrants from a federal judge targeting three stash houses in San Andres Cholula, Puebla. Days later, federal agents and military personnel carried out raids.

Authorities seized three drones modified to carry explosives, an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives, gunpowder, and several homemade explosive devices called “chrysanthemums.” Other items included weapons, ammunition, and communications equipment.

Mexican officials have not released the name of the criminal organization involved, however, Puebla is home to a few increasingly powerful fuel theft gangs.

On April 22, news outlets in Puebla published photographs purportedly depicting members of Mexico’s National Guard having lunch with operatives belonging to a fuel gang known as the “Valencia Family.” The photographs caused substantial controversy, Proceso Magazine reported. It remains unclear if the investigation into the National Guard is also linked to the discovery of the drones. According to the National Guard, a high-ranking commander was removed from his post in Puebla and others are face similar probes.

"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']",2020-05-05,Drones Outfitted with Explosives Seized in Mexico in ‘Active Terrorism Investigation’,"Authorities seized drones outfitted with makeshift explosive devices in central Mexico as part of an active terrorism investigation.

Drones fitted with C4 and other explosives were found in stash houses in the state of Puebla. On April 22, the Office of Mexico’s Attorney General received an anonymous tip about organized criminal activity that could lead to potential acts of terror.

On April 25, authorities obtained search warrants from a federal judge targeting three stash houses in San Andres Cholula, Puebla. Days later, federal agents and military personnel carried out raids.

Authorities seized three drones modified to carry explosives, an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives, gunpowder, and several homemade explosive devices called “chrysanthemums.” Other items included weapons, ammunition, and communications equipment.

['Bob Price'],2020-05-04,"Guns, Cash Seized at Outbound Texas Border Crossing","U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers seized a cache of firearms, ammunition, and undeclared cash as smugglers attempted to move them across the border into Mexico. The seizures took place in four separate incidents.

CBP officers assigned to the Camino Real Bridge in the Del Rio Sector observed a 2008 Saturn Astro XR approaching the outbound inspection station on April 29. The officers referred the driver, a 35-year-old Mexican male, to a secondary inspection station, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector CBP officials.

During a search of the vehicle, the officers discovered 12,247 in undeclared U.S. currency. The officers seized the currency and arrested the driver and his 45-year-old Mexican male passenger. They turned both over to the Maverick County Sheriff’s Office for further investigation.

One day earlier, officers assigned to International Bridge 1 searched a Chevrolet 2500 pickup truck as it prepared to leave Texas and enter Mexico. During the search, the officers found multiple firearms and ammunition, officials stated.

The firearms included a Smith & Wesson SD40 Crimson Trace pistol, a Winchester 190 .22 caliber rifle, three Smith & Wesson .40 caliber 14-round magazines, one Smith & Wesson Pro Mag .40 caliber 25-round magazine, and 319 rounds of ammunition in varying calibers, officials stated. Officers seized all of the firearms and ammunition.

Officers assigned to the Camino Real Bridge on April 27 searched a GMC 3500 pickup truck. During the inspection, the officers found a Taurus Armas GC2 9 mm pistol and two Pro Cal 9 mm magazines hidden inside a DVD player, officials stated. The officers seized the firearms and issued a $500 penalty.

That same day, CBP officers also seized 28 rounds of .22 caliber ammunition while searching a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck.

“Our frontline officers continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of blending inspection skills and experience with the use of technology in these enforcement actions,” Port Director Paul Del Rincon, Eagle Pass Port of Entry, said in a written statement.

['Bob Price'],2020-05-03,15 Miles of Additional Border Wall Completed in California,"Contractors completed 15 miles of a new border wall system in the El Centro Sector of Southern California, Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott announced. Border Patrol agents who work in the sector told Breitbart Texas previously completed sectors reduced crime in the area and made it safer to patrol.

In a tweet on Friday, U.S. Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott said, “Today, we completed a 15-mile section of border wall system in El Centro Sector that will provide much-needed infrastructure to help USBP agents secure the border.”

Border Security is National Security Today, we completed a 15 mile section of border wall system in El Centro Sector that will provide much needed infrastructure to help USBP agents secure the border.

It is not clear from the announcement if this is a new border wall system, or a replacement for outdated technology. Regardless, the new bollard-style wall provides increased security, technology surveillance, lighting, and all-weather roads to improve the response time of Border Patrol agents to crossings in the area.

Last summer, Breitbart Texas reported that the completion of new border wall construction in the El Sentro Sector made the area safer for agents to patrol and reduced crime in the area.

“We’ve had people throw Molotov cocktails over the old landing mat fence and it was dangerous because we couldn’t see through it like we can with [President Donald Trump’s] new border barrier. Here in El Centro, we have the highest stretch of border wall on the entire Southwest border. Trump’s new wall section is 30-feet high,” Border Patrol Agent Mike Matzke said in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2554.

“New sections of Trump’s wall have been built and anyone claiming that a 30-foot barrier that replaced a 10-foot high sheet metal fence isn’t new barrier doesn’t know what they are talking about,” the veteran Border Patrol agent explained. “The old legacy landing mat fence in our sector wasn’t effective and really bad people were jumping all day and night.”

“Assaults on Border Patrol agents in the area have dropped 65 percent since Trump built it,” Matzke concluded. “Illegal entries in the area are down 75 percent since Trump built it.”

The new border wall system previously completed in Calexico, California, was the first section of replacement wall to be completed, El Centro Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Joshua C. Devack said in a video presentation in October 2019 and reported by Breitbart Texas.

“Since the border wall system was completed in this area, local business and commerce is thriving and areas once considered dangerous are now secure,” Devack stated. “In addition, overall crime in this area has been significantly reduced thus making our community a safer place to live and work.”

CBP officials report the completion of 175 miles of new border wall systems along the U.S. border with Mexico. In the process, contractors utilized 245,000 tons of steel and 360,000 cubic yards of concrete.

Border Patrol agents previously told Breitbart Texas they like the new bollard walls because they are difficult to climb and provide agents with visibility to what is happening on the Mexican side of the wall.

"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']",2020-05-04,Mexican Health Officials Stop Sharing Coronavirus Case Estimates,"Mexico’s top health officials are now avoiding the practice of estimating and announcing Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases to instead focus on hospital capacity.

During a nightly news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell released the most current figures that show 23,471 confirmed cases and 2,154 fatalities. Lopez Gatell also minimized the fact that as of April 11, his epidemiologists estimated Mexico had approximately 104,562 cases. The official did not give a current estimate.

In early April, Lopez Gatell explained that Mexico was not engaging in mass testing and would instead develop statistical models which multiplied the number of confirmed cases against a set factor. The factor for several weeks was announced as 8, however, this weekend, Lopez Gatell stated it was a more fluid equation without a standard factor.

During Sunday’s news conference, Lopez Gatell claimed that the estimated number of cases was no longer important and people should instead focus on available bed space in hospitals. Lopez Gatell said “not every person who tests positive for COVID-19 is a confirmed case.”

Lopez Gatell recently admitted that previous case figures from daily reports did not account for private hospital patients. In some states, the number of cases could almost double if private patients were included. States like Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas release their own numbers to reflect all hospitals and show nearly double that of the federal figures.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,Wisconsin’s Stay-at-Home Order Challenged in Court for Religious Discrimination,"Two Wisconsin residents sued state and local officials Monday over a stay-at-home order that bans religious gatherings of more than nine people, and all public protests, while allowing larger gatherings in stores and other settings.

The plaintiffs, Jeré Fabick and Larry Chapman, are challenging Emergency Order 28, issued by Gov. Tony Evers and Secretary of Health Services Andrea Palm, arguing that it is “unconstitutional in singling out religious worship and political gatherings for special restrictions.”

Adam Laxalt, the former attorney general of Nevada, who is representing the plaintiffs through the Cooper & Kirk law firm, said in a memorandum released to the media:

As a former Attorney General, I understand that Government needs space to protect its citizens during times like these. While much of Wisconsin’s approach to fighting the pandemic is lawful, the state has clearly overstepped important Constitutional boundaries and has failed to protect its citizens’ fundamental liberties of freedom of conscience, right to assembly and free exercise, and the right to travel.

The filing notes:

While EO 28 permits 60 individuals—ten adult staff and 50 children (who obviously can not be required or expected to be properly masked and distanced)—to gather together in a day care center, it does not allow even ten religious believers (who can be required and expected to observe recognized protective measures) to gather together for worship. While Respondents allow hundreds of customers into Costco at any given time, no group of any size is allowed to assemble in the park, or any other public or private place, to engage in political protest or expression.

The filing also points out the the state’s rule discriminates against Jews in particular, since Orthodox Jews require a quorum of ten men for daily services to be held. “EO 28 operates as a complete ban on the form of worship practiced by some Wisconsinites,” the lawsuit states. “For example, under Jewish law, public prayer and worship may only occur in the presence of a Minyan, or quorum of ten Jewish males over the age of 13.”

The lawsuit follows U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s warning to state and local governments last week that they should not overreach in their stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic, and that the federal government would support challenges to orders that violated constitutional rights.

“[T]he Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis,” Barr wrote in a memorandum to U.S. Attorneys. “We must therefore be vigilant to ensure its protections are preserved, at the same time that the public is protected.”

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-05-05,Committee Calls for End to ‘Silent Slaughter’ of Christians in Nigeria,"The International Committee on Nigeria (ICON) has called for the appointment of U.S. Special Envoy to Nigeria, asserting that the country is failing to provide freedom of religion and basic protections for its citizens.

As “a nonprofit working to secure a future for all Nigerians,” ICON released a statement following the release of the 2020 Annual Report from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which designates Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” for its egregious violations of religious freedom.

In a statement sent to Breitbart News, ICON said that terrorist groups like Boko Haram have perpetrated “unspeakable violence” against unarmed and undefended Christian communities over the past decade, and the persecution has gone from bad to worse, resulting in a “silent slaughter.”

“Tens of thousands of innocent lives have been lost, the vast majority of them women and children,” the group said. “Thousands of churches have been torched. Entire communities, villages, and towns have been devastated. Millions have been kidnapped or displaced from their homes following persecution.”

“In an especially disgusting demonstration of brutality, the same terrorists that have operated unchecked for the last decade are now exploiting this time of crisis,” the committee said. “According to reports, more than 200 innocent lives have been taken already this month. That’s four times more than the number of lives lost to COVID-19.

Much of the anti-Christian violence in Nigeria is perpetrated by Fulani raiders who seek to rid the nation’s middle belt of Christians. According to ICON, statistics on Nigerian deaths suggest that the group is “six times deadlier than Boko Haram.”

ICON also took issue with the way the slaughter of Christians has been addressed by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, who is himself of Fulani ethnicity.

“Not only has President Muhammadu Buhari failed to stop the violence, but attacks against Christians have become more aggressive and deadly under his administration,” the group lamented. “We need to do everything in our power to stop this crisis as soon as possible.”

“USCIRF’s 2020 Report confirms the critical need for U.S. action to stop the killing of innocent people in Nigeria. Specifically, we need to send a Special Envoy to Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region,” the statement reads.

Williams'],2020-05-05,U.S. Bishops: ‘Disproportionate’ Impact of Coronavirus on Black Americans,"Leaders of the U.S. Bishops’ conference (USCCB) have issued a statement denouncing the coronavirus’ “disproportionate” effects on black Americans and the “systemic structural conditions” underlying it.

“Our hearts are wounded for the many souls mourned as African American communities across the nation are being disproportionately infected with and dying from the virus that causes COVID-19,” the bishops state in a May 4 message.

In their communiqué, the bishops suggest that the reason for the disproportionate impact of the virus on the black community relates to entrenched structures of racism in American society.

“We raise our voices to urge state and national leaders to examine the generational and systemic structural conditions that make the new coronavirus especially deadly to African American communities,” they state.

Among the document’s signatories are Bishop Shelton J. Fabre chairman of the USCCB’s Ad Hoc Committee Against Racism, Archbishop Paul S. Coakley, chairman of the Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development, Archbishop Nelson J. Perez, chairman of the Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church, and Bishop Joseph N. Perry, chairman of the Subcommittee on African American Affairs.

The release of bishops’ statement coincided with the Joe Biden campaign rollout of a broad policy proposal aimed at “rooting out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, our institutions, and our hearts.”

“The truth is, African Americans can never have a fair shot at the American Dream so long as entrenched disparities are still allowed to chip away at opportunity,” Mr. Biden wrote in a statement Monday announcing his “Lift Every Voice” proposal.

“The data we’ve seen so far suggests that African Americans are dying from COVID-19 at a far higher rate than whites,” Biden stated, and “the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exposed — and cruelly exacerbated — the disparities long faced by African Americans.”

Blacks in the U.S. “are less likely to have a job they can do from home, forcing them to make the difficult choice between their health and a paycheck,” Biden noted.

“Long-standing systemic inequalities may also be contributing to this disparity — including the fact that African Americans are more likely to be uninsured,” he said.

[],2020-05-05,Rays Minor Leaguer Learned of Family’s Murder on Facebook,"DANVILLE, Va. (AP) — Tampa Bay Rays minor leaguer Blake Bivens says he learned through social media of the deaths of three family members last summer.

Speaking publicly for what is believed to be the first time about the Aug. 28 deaths of wife Emily, 1-year-old son Culle and mother-in-law Joan Bernard, Bivens recalled details of traveling home to Keeling, Virginia, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he had been on a road trip with the Rays’ Double-A Montgomery affiliate.

The 24-year-old pitcher’s brother-in-law, Matthew Bernard, was arrested, charged with three counts of murder and is awaiting trial.

Bivens spoke for more than 30 minutes Sunday with interim senior pastor Travis Gore of The River Church during a conversation aired live on Facebook.

The athlete said his faith has helped him cope with the deaths.

“The only thing I really remember from the whole plane ride is I just went through periods. I just stared at the back of the seat the whole time, trying to get my mind to wrap around what I’m hearing,” Bivens said.

“It’s almost kind of like, `This isn’t really happening.’ I was more in a state of shock. I would go through periods of shaking,” he said. “Then I would start to lose it a little bit and break down and cry. It was kind of like a circle. The plane rides just seemed like they took forever.”

Bivens said he initially feared something was wrong when he awakened that day and had not received a text message from his wife.

The concern grew when he couldn’t reach her and he learned on Facebook that his brother-in-law was being sought by police. He returned to social media, searching for information, while sitting in the Chattanooga airport.

“First headline I see is two females and a small child were gone. I immediately knew that was them,” Bivens said. “I found out my family was gone over a Facebook headline. I just immediately began to scream in the middle of the airport.”

The pitcher said the trip home “could have been a whole lot worse for me” if he had not been accompanied by three members of the Rays organization, including Montgomery manager Morgan Ensberg.

“I think the hardest moment for me was when I got home and I walked in my son’s bedroom for the first time and realized I was never going to see him on this earth again,” Bivens said. “That was the worst moment in my life. Nothing ever will come to feeling the way I felt at that moment.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/05/rays-minor-leaguer-learned-of-familys-murder-on-facebook/

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-05,"Brett Favre Paid $1.1 Million in Mississippi Welfare Funds for Speeches He Didn’t Attend, Audit Says","Former Green Bay Packers quarterback and NFL legend Brett Favre, was paid $1.1 million in Mississippi welfare funds to deliver speeches that he never attended, according to a recent audit of the Mississippi Department of Human Services.

As the Mississippi Clarion Ledger reports, Favre was paid in two installments totaling $1.1 million for speaking engagements, autograph signings, appearances, and promotions. According the Ledger, it was learned that Favre “did not speak nor was he present for those events.”

The audit revealed more than $94 million in questionable disbursements by the Mississippi DHS.

Favre will reportedly not face criminal charges over the scandal, but others will, Pro Football Talk reports.

Mississippi State auditor Shad White said that the report “shows the most egregious misspending my staff have seen in their careers at the Office of the State Auditor.” White added, “if there was a way to misspend money, it seems DHS leadership or their grantees thought of it and tried it.”

Brett Favre was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in 2016. He threw for nearly 72,000 yards over a 20-year career spent with the Falcons, Packers, Jets, and Vikings.

['Kyle Morris'],2020-05-04,Massachusetts Golf Course to Reopen During Lockdown,"As small business owners around the country suffer the economic wrath of COVID-19, with some state governments refusing to allow them to resume operation, one country club in Massachusetts is planning on defying the state order.

Cara Cullen, along with other members of the Marroney family, has owned Wachusett Country Club in West Boylston, Massachusetts, since 1939. The family has also owned Kettle Brook Golf Club in Paxton, MA, since 2008. Cullen spoke with Breitbart News about the decision she is weighing as to when to reopen for business and defy the state’s order.

Asked during a call with Breitbart News on Monday if she intends to reopen despite the governor’s lockdown order, she said yes she does and is working out the details of how to do so now.

According to Cullen, there seems to be a “general consensus” among golf clubs in the area to defy the state government’s order and reopen for business, saying, “We don’t have a choice” and that they have “nothing to lose at this point.” Cullen said she believes that if golf courses are not reopened soon, she believes most in the Central Massachusetts area will “go under.”

“We have sat back and remained patient while 48 states have opened up golf,” Cullen said before she mentioned that several from the state are traveling to other states to play golf during the state’s lockdown. “That to me is such a hazardous situation to have thousands of golfers crossing the borders to New York and Connecticut every single day to golf. I mean how many times have they brought the virus back?”

Cullen placed blame on the state’s governor, Charlie Baker, for refusing to allow golf courses in the state to reopen, saying he has created a “hazardous condition” that forces people to travel to other states.

Cullen also called out the behavior in other stores across the state like Walmart, saying there is “barely any social distancing” and people are “flocking to Home Depot, Target, Walmart, to alleviate their boredom and frustration.”

“There is no way you can tell me that what goes on down at Walmart is safer than opening a golf course,” Cullen said, adding that they are at “wits’ end.”

Asked about the economic impact of the closure, Cullen said she lost her mother-in-law in March to the coronavirus. “If I thought for a minute that it would be unsafe, I would never do it and I would take the economic hit,” Cullen said in regards to reopening. “I do understand how important and real this virus is… This weekend we would have taken in $30,000 at each golf course.”

“Governor Baker has no problem endangering the lives of all these essential employees of Stop and Shop, Home Depot, and Target, but we can’t open golf courses because it’s unsafe,” Cullen reiterated. “If he really thinks golf is not safe, then he should tell Massachusetts people right now that they cannot cross the border to golf in other states.”

Cullen pointed out that her customers are working-class, blue-collar Americans, including “firefighters, police officers, electricians, and plumbers.” She also discussed the rise of mental health issues Americans face, mentioning that 48 other states understand that outdoor recreation is essential.

“Every single aspect of opening will help the safety of what’s going on as far as stopping people from crossing the borders, stopping people from flocking to the essential stores that are open, and allowing people an outlet for their mental health and physical health,” Cullen said.

“We can’t just close up and wait it out,” Cullen continued. “If you don’t maintain a golf course, within weeks it would no longer be a golf course and you could never get it back to its original condition.”

“We’re using thousands of dollars of chemicals and treatments, every single day we are out mowing and cutting and there is no revenue coming in,” Cullen added.

During the interview, Cullen stated that she had been in recent conversations with the state government in hopes of getting the course reopened, but they failed to deliver. She said she believes the lockdown extension until May 18 is a “delay tactic.” Cullen said she joined a call recently with Lt. Governor Karyn Polito to discuss the possibility of reopening golf courses in the state. Cullen said the conversation sounded “very promising,” but it was halted on Monday with no expected reopening date given to Cullen.

Should they decide to reopen, Cullen talked about safety measures she would implement to ensure that the course remains safe for those who utilize it, which included pins for hands-free ball removal, one rider per cart, cart sanitation, masks for employees, closures of course buildings (food, etc.), and golfers to have to wait in their car until ten minutes before tee time.

“I think it’s lazy, I think it’s petty, and I think it’s not looking out for the small businesses,” Cullen concluded.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/04/massachusetts-country-club-mulls-possibility-of-reopening-during-lockdown/

['Katherine Rodriguez'],2020-05-04,Two Men Found Dead on NYC Subway,"Two men who were believed to be homeless were found dead on the New York City subway trains in less than 24 hours this past weekend.

The first incident took place Friday night at the 168th St. station in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. The New York Police Department (NYPD) said that transit workers discovered a dead 56-year-old man on a C train while at the station.

The second incident took place Saturday morning around 8:20 a.m., when a rider called 911 after finding an unresponsive body. When emergency medical services (EMS) responders arrived, they found 61-year-old Robert Mangual dead on the floor of the 4 train at Brooklyn’s Utica Avenue station.

A spokesperson for the city medical examiner’s office said Monday that a cause of death has not been determined for either man.

In a similar incident last month, a 62-year-old man was found dead on a subway train near the Astoria section of Queens.

Subway ridership has gone down more than 90 percent due to the coronavirus, but there has been an increase in homeless people using subway cars as a shelter during the pandemic.

This has prompted the city to shut down its subways between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. starting May 6 for disinfecting.

['Amy Furr'],2020-05-04,Drive-In Movie Theater Previously Deemed 'Non-Essential' to Open Friday,"A drive-in movie theater in McHenry, Illinois, received the go-ahead Sunday to open for business after it was labeled nonessential during the coronavirus pandemic.

Sunday, the McHenry Outdoor Theater owner, Scott Dehn, said they would begin the season Friday and Saturday night thanks to their many supporters, according to a Facebook post.

The post read:

You came together as a single voice in an effort to help us open. Your efforts are a true testament as to what can be accomplished when people work together towards a common goal. Imagine if we all did that across all areas of our lives. You are all amazing. When things got tough, I found myself browsing through your comments on my Facebook posts. You never lost hope and your supportive comments gave me the inspiration to keep on trying. Thank you.

Although he satisfied all the state’s guidelines, Dehn said officials told him at the last minute he could not open the theater on May 1 because it was a nonessential business.

“I remain hopeful that something good will come of this. I noticed that there was even a petition making the rounds on social media with over 7,800 signatures! I mean, WOW… That is amazing,” he wrote on Facebook.

['Amy Furr'],2020-05-04,Drive-In Movie Theater Previously Deemed 'Non-Essential' to Open Friday,"A drive-in movie theater in McHenry, Illinois, received the go-ahead Sunday to open for business after it was labeled nonessential during the coronavirus pandemic.

Sunday, the McHenry Outdoor Theater owner, Scott Dehn, said they would begin the season Friday and Saturday night thanks to their many supporters, according to a Facebook post.

The post read:

You came together as a single voice in an effort to help us open. Your efforts are a true testament as to what can be accomplished when people work together towards a common goal. Imagine if we all did that across all areas of our lives. You are all amazing. When things got tough, I found myself browsing through your comments on my Facebook posts. You never lost hope and your supportive comments gave me the inspiration to keep on trying. Thank you.

['Katherine Rodriguez'],2020-05-04,Three Platypuses Returned Back into Wild After Australian Bushfire Crisis,"Three platypuses at the center of an emergency evacuation during Australia’s scorching bushfire season have been released back into their natural habitat.

Rescuers transported the animals from Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve near Canberra to Sydney’s Taronga Zoo this past December, while bushfires ran rampant, and their watery habitats came close to dissolving due to the extreme drought, the Australian Broadcasting Company reported.

Dr. Phoebe Meagher with the Taronga Zoo said researchers had to act quickly because the bushfires were predicted to sweep the area in a matter of days.

“With the help of the University of New South Wales, we got out the nets and the tinny — and we managed to save seven platypus from the drying creeks,” she said.

Recent rainfall in the area means it is now safe for the platypuses to return to their habitat at the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.

“We’ve had lots of rain, the creeks are full, and there’s lots of food available,” Dr. Meagher said.

A video of conservation workers releasing the platypuses in the wild showed that the animals did not leave the zoo empty-handed.

The returned platypuses have been outfitted with some high-tech trackers to better understand their movements and behaviors of a species that is elusive and going extinct.

Dr. Meagher said a second group of platypuses would be returned to the wild in the coming weeks.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2020/05/04/three-platypuses-returned-back-wild-after-australian-bushfire-crisis/

['Oliver Jj Lane'],2020-05-05,Coronavirus: Wages of over Half of UK Adults Now Paid by British State,"Almost a quarter of all British employees have been ‘furloughed’ in two weeks, meaning over half of the British adult population is now being paid by the government, possibly the highest proportion ever.

The UK government announced the coronavirus job retention scheme, a state-funded programme where businesses slowing or suspending operations during the national lockdown could avoid firing their staff, in March. Rather than employees being laid off and shuffled onto the government’s unemployed claimant count, the government would instead pay employers to keep paying wages even though the furloughed staff were not doing any actual work.

Uptake of the programme was enormous, and perhaps greater than expected, with 800,000 employers nationwide signing up to the scheme, placing 6.3 million people onto the government payroll at a cost of around £8 billion, the Treasury said. The bill for keeping essentially unemployed people in their jobs was so large, it is now costing the British taxpayer the same amount that it spends on the NHS, the chancellor revealed.

The Job Retention Scheme launched on 20 April. By midnight 3 May a total of: ➡️ 6.3m jobs furloughed *

➡️ 800K employers furloughing **

➡️ Total value of claims £8bn Apply for a grant to cover the wages of your furloughed staff now: https://t.co/bx1Nszshsr pic.twitter.com/29n9h0RB2k — HM Revenue & Customs (@HMRCgovuk) May 4, 2020

In normal times the number of people earning a wage in private business significantly outweighs those in the government sector, but with almost a quarter of all employed people becoming state-paid in just a couple of weeks, the balance has tipped, judging by historic employment trend data, for the first time in British history.

Between the 6.3 million newly furloughed staff, and over 20 million people either received a state pension or government benefits, there are now more people on the government payroll than private, according to an analysis by British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. The proportion is a significant rise on any other period in modern British history, including times of high government interaction with the workforce including the two World Wars where millions of Britons were under arms, or during the late-1970s highwater of state ownership of industry, or during the early 1980s and ’90s crashes.

The difference also throws into sharp contrast the difference wrought by a century of so-called social democracy and government growth. While in 2020 under the coronavirus emergency over 50 per cent of the adult population is in the employment of the state, in 1920 less than eight per cent were in receipt of tax money.

Speaking on Monday evening to British television news network ITN, chancellor Rishi Sunak, who initiated the furlough scheme, reflected that the trend was “clearly not a sustainable situation” and the government was working to wind down the programme. Yet businesses warned if the supply of government money — due to run out in June — was turned off too soon, they would simply make their suspended employees redundant.

Mr Sunak said: “There will be no cliff edge to the furlough scheme. I am working as we speak to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and to ease people back into work in a measured way. But as some scenarios have suggested, we are potentially spending as much on the furlough scheme as we do on the NHS, for example. Now clearly, that is not a sustainable situation.

['Kurt Zindulka'],2020-05-05,Brexit's Nigel Farage Visited by Police Over Illegal Boat Migrant Reporting,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage was visited by police officers Monday, warning him to observe the “essential travel” rules after he reported on illegal boat migrants arriving in Dover.

On Monday, Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage went to the port at Dover and filmed the Border Force bringing a group of migrants “including a very young baby” to shore.

Yet after continuing his work as a politician-turned-journalist to expose the “scandal” of Britain’s borders remaining open at a time where the rest of the country is closed, Mr Farage said that “two police officers just knocked on my door to advise me on essential travel.”

“They had received a complaint that I had been to Dover to report on the illegal migrant scandal taking place,” Farage said, adding: “What a total waste of time and money.”

The national lockdown measures that were imposed on the country allow exceptions to the restriction of movement for certain key workers including “journalists and broadcasters who are providing public service broadcasting.”

Police forces across the country have been accused of overzealous enforcement of the national lockdown. Last week, it was revealed that the Crown Prosecution Service will review every charge, conviction, and sentence that have been brought under the Coronavirus Act following a string of wrongful convictions.

Lockdown lunacy. Two police officers just knocked on my door to advise me on essential travel. They had received a complaint that I had been to Dover to report on the illegal migrant scandal taking place. What a total waste of time and money. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) May 4, 2020

In his film at Dover, Mr Farage blamed the inaction of the Home Office for the growing “scandal” of illegal boat migrants landing on British shores during the Chinese coronavirus crisis.

“The Border Force is supposed to protect our borders, not be a taxi service for illegal immigrants and yet that’s what the Home Office are telling them what to do,” Mr Farage said.

Mr Farage lamented the “enormous risks people are taking”, but cautioned that it should be remembered that all of this is “organised by criminal trafficking gangs”.

“Remember that even if some of these people qualify as refugees, you claim refugee status in the first safe country you come to. France is a safe country, and I do just get the feeling that we are being so weak about this… that if already over a thousand people have come this year… goodness knows what this figure is going to be,” the Brexit Party leader added.

“If we get a calm summer, they are going to start coming in much much bigger vessels, and we’ve got to get a grip on this,” Mr Farage warned.

The veteran political campaigner, who also serves as an ad hoc journalist as the host of his own LBC radio programme, was following up previous reporting from the beaches of East Sussex, where he interviewed locals who said illegal migrants met and sea or received onshore are just the tip of the iceberg, with some landing entirely undetected, unnoticed by the authorities and unreported by the press. Speaking from East Sussex, Mr Farage said: “This scandal, I think, is far bigger than anyone realises… Not one, to my knowledge, has been returned [to France] and [home secretary] Priti Patel needs to get tough.”

This earned criticism in certain quarters of the mainstream media, with Sunday Times journalist Sarah Baxter, in particular, chastising him for continuing to pursue an issue — mass immigration — with, she claimed, had now gone “right off the boil”.

“I wonder, who is out of touch here? Is it me, or is it the mainstream media?” Farage asked at the time.

On Sunday, the Border Force stopped 49 migrants attempting to cross the English Channel in three rubber dinghies, bringing them ashore at Dover. On Monday, an additional 16 migrants — claiming to be from Iraq and Iran — were brought ashore.

Meanwhile, the UK’s French counterparts stopped an additional 39 migrants on Sunday and a further 39 migrants on Monday before they were able to enter British territorial waters, meaning that over 130 migrants had set sail from France in the span of two days, the BBC reports.

Last week, Home Secretary Priti Patel spoke to her French counterpart about returning more migrants to France. However, there has been no indication from the British government that it intends to turn away migrants at the border.

Last year, 1,890 illegal boat migrants reached British shores, but the British government only deported 125 of them, despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s promise to send migrants back.

['Kurt Zindulka'],2020-05-05,MI6: UK Government Was 'Fully Aware' of China’s Corona-Cover-up,"The British government was made “fully aware” of what was “really happening” in China during the early stages of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, unnamed intelligence officials claim.

Anonymous sources, allegedly from within MI6 — the UK’s equivalent to the CIA — claim that intelligence officials had informed government ministers “not to believe Beijing’s claims” about the true scale of the pandemic.

“We didn’t believe these figures coming from China. The Government would have been fully aware of the true scale of the virus in China at that time,” an MI6 source is said to have told The Telegraph.

“The intelligence community would have known what was really happening in China. The idea that the UK would have taken Chinese figures at face value is frankly ridiculous. If the Chinese are lying, the role of the intelligence community is to know what the real figures might be if they are being hidden,” a former senior intelligence official added.

Despite this, the government refused to shut down travel from China or from any other country during the pandemic, with an estimated 15,000 people arriving per day through British airports. The government also continued to use the reported death toll numbers coming from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during Downing Street’s daily “global death comparison” until April.

China Lied, People Died: Five Eyes Report Details CCP Coronavirus Cover-up https://t.co/sHLCxA7ZRt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020

The revelations from the unnamed MI6 sources follow an intelligence leak from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zeeland, that detailed the scale of the CCP coronavirus cover-up.

The report also detailed the possibility that the virus emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which it concluded had been working on coronaviruses in bats, with one strain being a 96 per cent genetic match to the COVID-19 virus that sparked a global pandemic.

The Chinese embassy in London refuted the claims that the virus emerged from the Wuhan lab, saying in a statement: “There is no evidence showing the virus came from a lab. Rumour-mongering, as well as slander and smear, will only damage international solidarity.”

The British conservative think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society revealed images from the institute, which purportedly displayed the “dangerous safety standards” at the Wuhan lab. However, it is not clear what the workers in the images were doing or whether protective gear was required.

The director of the Asia Studies Centre at the think tank, Matthew Henderson said: “Given what we now know about lax biosecurity standards, it is at the very least plausible that human error at a virology lab contributed to the spread of the pandemic.”

“Since Beijing refuses independent access to these sites, their records and their research, why should we think otherwise?” Henderson questioned.

['Simon Kent'],2020-05-05,Australian Lawmakers Call to Slash Immigration in Post-Coronavirus World,"Australian lawmakers of all political stripes have joined a call to slash migrant numbers after the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, arguing the country’s historic reliance on new arrivals to boost growth has hurt workers while driving soaring house prices and crowded cities.

Their push addresses concerns many Australian employers use the current temporary visa system to avoid hiring local workers and were exploiting people whose visa status and security depended on their wage provider.

“Do we want migrants to return to Australia in the same numbers and in the same composition as before the crisis?” Labor Party parliamentary member Kristina Keneally wrote in an opinion piece. “Our answer should be no.”

In particular, she called for a reduction in the number of young, lower-skilled temporary workers permitted to enter the country and more investment in skills training for locals at a time when more than a quarter of Australia’s population is foreign born, the second largest in the OECD.

“We must make sure that Australians get a fair go and a first go at jobs,” Keneally outlined in the Sun-Herald and the Sunday Age newspapers.

“Our post-Covid-19 economic recovery must ensure Australia shifts away from its increasing reliance on a cheap supply of overseas, temporary labour that undercuts wages for Australian workers and takes jobs Australians could do.”

A member of the ruling conservative coalition, Andrew Laming, agreed. He said there was scope to increase the skill-based element of the migrant intake, arguing it was vital to focus on “quality rather than quantity”.

Senator Dean Smith has also raised concerns about immigration, saying Australia deserves a more comprehensive debate in the wake of the pandemic.

“Any plan to reshape Australia once the coronavirus has passed must start with a conversation about the composition, geographic spread and the skill components of our population,” he said.

The current immigration debate in Australia’s parliament is a continuation of one that began in earnest even before the Chinese coronavirus epidemic took hold, as Breitbart News reported.

In January, soaring house prices and crowded cities combined to convince a clear majority of Australians the country’s open door immigration push must end.

Just 30.4 per cent of Australians now believe the country needs more people, according to a poll conducted by the Australian National University (ANU).

This was compared to 69.6 per cent who felt Australia did not need more people, a dramatic increase since a similar poll was done in 2010.

The collapse in support was most prominent among males with just 32.8 percent supporting a bigger Australia compared to 53.4 percent in the 2010 poll.

Most Australians support the notion of cultural diversity but did not want population growth to come at the expense of the quality of life of the majority, according to the survey.

The results confirm previous calls by local politicians for the country’s conservative coalition government to end mass migration.

Australia’s current population growth is the largest it has experienced since colonisation.

In 1981 the Australian population was around 14.9 million people. By June 2018 it had reached 25.0 million, with the last five million of that growth occurring since December 2004.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in 2018 he intended to cut Australia’s permanent migration intake by about 30,000 people, citing public concern about congested cities.

“They are saying: enough, enough, enough,” Morrison told the 2018 Bradfield Oration.

In December last year immigration was again at the forefront of national debate when the Department of Home Affairs declared social cohesion must be at the forefront of any future decisions on migrant intakes.

This includes cautioning migrants they must fully embrace Australian values, including learning English, while pledging allegiance to the country that will be their new home, as Breitbart News reported.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/australian-lawmakers-call-to-slash-mass-immigration-in-post-coronavirus-world/
['Simon Kent'],2020-05-05,Australian Lawmakers Call to Slash Immigration in Post-Coronavirus World,"Australian lawmakers of all political stripes have joined a call to slash migrant numbers after the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, arguing the country’s historic reliance on new arrivals to boost growth has hurt workers while driving soaring house prices and crowded cities.

Their push addresses concerns many Australian employers use the current temporary visa system to avoid hiring local workers and were exploiting people whose visa status and security depended on their wage provider.

“Do we want migrants to return to Australia in the same numbers and in the same composition as before the crisis?” Labor Party parliamentary member Kristina Keneally wrote in an opinion piece. “Our answer should be no.”

In particular, she called for a reduction in the number of young, lower-skilled temporary workers permitted to enter the country and more investment in skills training for locals at a time when more than a quarter of Australia’s population is foreign born, the second largest in the OECD.

“We must make sure that Australians get a fair go and a first go at jobs,” Keneally outlined in the Sun-Herald and the Sunday Age newspapers.

“Our post-Covid-19 economic recovery must ensure Australia shifts away from its increasing reliance on a cheap supply of overseas, temporary labour that undercuts wages for Australian workers and takes jobs Australians could do.”

A member of the ruling conservative coalition, Andrew Laming, agreed. He said there was scope to increase the skill-based element of the migrant intake, arguing it was vital to focus on “quality rather than quantity”.

Senator Dean Smith has also raised concerns about immigration, saying Australia deserves a more comprehensive debate in the wake of the pandemic.

“Any plan to reshape Australia once the coronavirus has passed must start with a conversation about the composition, geographic spread and the skill components of our population,” he said.

['Jack Montgomery'],2020-05-04,Left-wing Politician Charged with Vote-by-Mail Fraud,"Local politician Israr Rashid has been charged with a number of vote-by-mail offences in High Wycombe, England.

Rashid won the Totteridge and Bowerdean seat on Buckingham County Council in a by-election on February 7th, securing 40.8 per cent of the vote on a turnout of 30.21 per cent — far ahead of his nearest competitor, independent candidate Matt Knight, on 27.8 per cent of vote, or the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates, on 21.2 per cent and 10.2 per cent of the vote.

Rashid had originally been the Labour candidate for the seat — and is described as having been the Labour candidate in the Buckingham County Council news bulletin announcing the outcome of the election — but, according to the Bucks Free Press, the left-wing party “suspended” him just days before the vote was held.

The local news outlet now reports that he has been charged with “conspiracy to defraud the electoral services manager at Wycombe District Council by dishonestly causing or permitting to be submitted to the officer postal voting statements which contained false particulars”, as well as “two counts of committing, aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring in the commission of voting by post as some other person.”

Rashid’s lawyer submitted not guilty pleas via Skype on his behalf at Aylesbury Crown Court, whose proceedings have been disrupted by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Judge Francis Sheridan said a trial for the politician would be organised as swiftly as possible, warning that “If [Rashid] does not turn up for trial, it will be held in his absence” and imposing a number of bail conditions preventing him from contacting certain people or coming within 100 feet of certain addresses, to prevent “interference” with witnesses.

['Frances Martel'],2020-05-05,North Korea Says 'Fake News Rampant in South Korea',"The North Korean propaganda website Meari published an article condemning South Korea’s free press for unspecified “fake news” on Tuesday following weeks of speculation over the health of communist dictator Kim Jong-un.

Kim did not make any public appearances for weeks since April 11, notably choosing not to attend a ceremony for the “Day of the Sun,” grandfather Kim Il-sung’s birthday and North Korea’s most important holiday. His absence resulted in widespread, anonymous reports claiming that Kim had either died, become “brain dead,” been seriously injured in a missile attack, suffered a major cardiovascular health episode, or had contracted the Chinese coronavirus.

On Friday, North Korean state media published images of a man they claimed to be Kim cutting a ribbon at a ceremony celebrating the construction of a fertilizer plant. The videos and photos allegedly of Kim were the first anyone had seen of him since April 11 and appeared to confirm that he was healthy, able to walk and talk, and in command of the country.

South Korea’s Yonhap news agency translated the comments in Meari, which notably did not mention Kim Jong-un himself or any of the rumors relating to his health recently.

“Fake news that has been rampant in South Korea is putting people in a state of confusion,” Meari claimed, blaming “conservative media” for much of the reporting. While conservative newspapers like Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo published some reports on Kim’s health, the most prominent reports claiming Kim was in danger came from left-wing outlets like CNN. The state propaganda outlet claimed that South Korean media was engaged in the act of “manipulating public opinion by intentionally fabricating false facts about a specific subject or group with a view to pursuing certain political and economic objectives.” It reportedly did not identify any subject or group in particular. Elsewhere in North Korean state media, outlets focused on the construction of the Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory, which Kim visited for the ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday. Rather than discuss Kim himself, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) hailed the “wonderful construction” of the factory. “The scientists, technicians and builders of the country built the modern phosphatic fertilizer production base tantamount to establishing a new industrial field despite the vicious sanctions and pressure from the hostile forces and the disastrous spread of the malignant virus worldwide,” KCNA applauded on Monday, one of several regular mentions of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. North Korea claims to have identified zero cases of coronavirus despite being bordered by three of the world’s most affected countries: its origin nation, China; Russia; and South Korea. KCNA reiterated that Kim was present this weekend at the site, claiming he “learned in detail about the construction which was in a standstill due to various bottlenecks in the early stage of the construction and saw to it that an audacious operation was unfolded to build the factory our own way to be perfect one.” On Tuesday, Rodong Sinmun, the state newspaper, continued its usual stream of communist agitprop.

“The materialization of the dream and ideal of our people and triumphant advance of socialism depend on living our own way,” a column in the North Korean outlet read. “Even in the worst adversity in which others would be disrupted a hundred times, the red flag of socialism have been fluttering on this land generation after generation and the DPRK [North Korea] has been demonstrating its might as a great independent power, impregnable socialist fortress.”

Despite publishing significant volumes of material in the past week, the “fake news” diatribe has been the closest that North Korean state media has gotten to addressing the Kim health rumors. The gossip report that elevated discussion of Kim’s disappearance internationally appeared last month in CNN, citing anonymous sources who claimed that Kim was suffering from heart disease and was in “grave danger” after a surgical procedure. That report prompted NBC News’ Katy Tur to claim that Kim was “brain dead” on Twitter, then delete the claim.

Other reports suggested that Kim was struggling to overcome infection of the Chinese coronavirus, potentially the product of a meeting with Chinese doctors on other health issues. Yet other reports claimed that Kim had not been infected but had been exposed to the virus, necessitating quarantine. Kim could not publicly announce quarantine when the government claimed no cases of coronavirus had occurred in the country.

A report in Dong-A Ilbo also suggested, again citing anonymous sources, that Kim had been injured in a missile test and could not appear in public without revealing the injury. Two newly-elected South Korean lawmakers said, respectively, that Kim was dead or that Kim could not walk properly from a health condition. The two have since apologized profusely; media outlets who reported the other rumors have largely not done the same.

North Korea has also not remarked on a bizarre incident this weekend following Kim’s reemergence in which North Korean soldiers fired across the border into the South. South Korea reported no injuries or deaths and dismissed the incident. American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said this weekend Washington believes the shots fired to be “accidental.” Radio Free Asia (RFA) quoted some observers, however, who believed the shots to be a message that North Korea did not intend to change its hostile policies against Seoul.

Many reports indicated that Kim spent much of his absence in Wonsan, a northern port city he has invested heavily in towards making a seaside resort. Kim’s family train appeared to be in the city in satellite images, and other surveillance showed movement of Kim’s fleet of yachts there. Sunchon, where the fertilizer factory is located, is easily reachable within a day’s time from Wonsan.

['Simon Kent'],2020-05-05,W.H.O. Rejects Claims Wuhan Lab Spawned Coronavirus Epidemic,"The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) on Monday sided with the Chinese Communist Party and rejected claims by Washington that a secretive laboratory in the southern China city of Wuhan spawned the global coronavirus epidemic.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday in an interview with ABC there was “enormous evidence” Covid-19 originated in the lab.

This followed the revelation the intelligence community has not yet ruled out that the coronavirus accidentally escaped from the lab in Wuhan, where scientists were studying bat coronaviruses.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a rare statement addressing the matter on Thursday, as Breitbart News reported.

“The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,” it said.

But the administration had not produced evidence publicly or provided it to the W.H.O., said its emergencies director, Dr Michael Ryan. “So from our perspective, this remains speculative.

“Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,” Ryan told a virtual briefing, stressing this was “a very important piece of public health information for future control”.

“If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the W.H.O. to operate in an information vacuum in that regard.”

Ryan did not reveal if indeed the W.H.O. had carried out any investigations of its own or questioned the Chinese administration over the origins of the deadly pandemic.

Instead Ryan said it was important for the W.H.O. to learn from Chinese scientists’ data and exchange knowledge to “find the answers together”, but cautioned against politicising the issue.

“If this is projected as aggressive investigation of wrongdoing, that is much more difficult to deal with. That’s a political issue,” he said.

Chinese state media attacked the U.S. claims, with the state broadcaster CCTV labelling them “insane and evasive” in a Monday opinion piece entitled “Evil Pompeo is wantonly spewing poison and spreading lies”.

The Chinese Communist Party-backed Global Times also published an editorial accusing Pompeo and Trump of “bluffing”, and said if the U.S. had evidence it should present it.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/05/05/w-h-o-backs-china-rejects-claim-wuhan-lab-spawned-coronavirus-epidemic/

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-05-05,China Orders Christian Church to Discontinue Online Worship,"The Chinese communist party has ordered the Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) to cease all online worship services, in its latest crackdown on Christianity in the country.

In late 2018, Chinese authorities carried out a series of tightly coordinated raids on the 5,000-member Early Rain Covenant Church in the city of Chengdu, arresting more than 100 members, including Pastor Wang Yi and his wife.

The government cut the phone line to the church and Chinese police reportedly tracked down church members using the location signals from their mobile phones. Pastor Wang later received a sentence of nine years in prison for “inciting subversion” and running an illegal “business.”

China’s state-run Global Times newspaper argued at the time that Wang was not a true Christian but an agitator “brainwashed by Western values.”

Since the shuttering of their church, Early Rain members have had to resort to online streamed worship services, but now the government wants to stop those as well, the Christian Post reported Monday.

Last weekend, police brought in members of ERCC in charge of church activities and online services and demanded that they bring a halt to all activities. One of those detained was Ran Yunfei, who had been scheduled to give a testimony during a church service. Police allowed him to return home only after the service had ended.

As Breitbart News reported, on Easter Sunday, police from the Public Security Bureau raided the homes of ERCC members, arresting six church leaders for participating in an online worship service via Zoom.

“At that time I was also in the Zoom call, but there was a long period of time where I did not hear a thing,” one church member said. “I thought it’s the network connection issue at first, but I soon heard a quarrel erupt. Our co-worker Wang Jun was questioning some people, ‘Who are you to do this [to us]?’”

The Easter service included a taped sermon given by imprisoned Pastor Wang, which apparently sparked the raids. One church member, Zhang Jiangqing, said that police came to his house and threatened harsh treatment if he continues to listen to Wang’s sermons.

“Don’t participate in already banned [religious] activities anymore! Don’t listen to Pastor [Wang]’s sermons anymore! If you do this again, we will deal with it seriously and take you away!” Zhang said.

In its 2020 report released last week, the U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said that religious freedom conditions in China “continued to deteriorate” in 2019.

“The Chinese government has created a high-tech surveillance state, utilizing facial recognition and artificial intelligence to monitor religious minorities,” it noted.

Commissioner Johnnie Moore said there was no doubt that China is “the world’s foremost violator of human rights and religious freedom.”

“It cannot be compared to any other country in the world not only because of its inexcusable actions, but because of the way it aids and abets similar actions by other countries all around the world,” Moore said.

USCIRF recommended that the U.S. government “intensify efforts to counter Chinese government influence operations in the United States that are designed to suppress information about or advocacy in response to violations of religious freedom in China.”

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-05,Nigeria: Doctors Go on Strike over Insufficient Coronavirus Protection,"Medical doctors in Nigeria began a strike on Monday over a lackluster welfare package that included an “inadequate response” from the government to the increased health risks posed by the country’s worsening Chinese coronavirus outbreak, the nation’s Daily Trust reported.

Yesterday, the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in southwestern Nigeria’s Ogun State announced the start of a three-day warning strike effective from Monday over the deficient welfare package. ARD said the strike action followed the alleged refusal of the state government to respond to concerns over the need for an improved welfare package for its members.

“There has been no commitment whatsoever from the government on the issue of appropriate remuneration, entry-level, new minimum wage, hazard allowance, and life insurance for our members,” the association said in a letter to the state governor.

“Despite the inadequate response of Ogun State government to the health risks confronted by our members during this COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic, our members went ahead to continue their work diligently in their various departments and at the isolation center,” the letter said.

“We were taken aback by the arbitrary change in only hazard allowance to be given as COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] Special Hazard Allowance to all health workers,” ARD added.

The association condemned the increase in hazard allowance from N5,000 [$12.82] to N10,000 [$25.64] as “a mere charade.”

As Africa’s top oil producer, Nigeria’s economy has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which has decreased global oil demand. And as Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria faces a potentially devastating coronavirus outbreak, which has been quietly intensifying in recent weeks.

On May 1, in northwestern Nigeria’s Kano state, the number of new coronavirus cases nearly tripled over a few days, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported last Friday.

The Nigeria Center for Disease Control said the number of recorded infections across Kano rose to 219 on May 1, up from 77 at the start of last week.

This report followed shortly after news that over 150 people died in Kano from a “strange ailment” over a two-day period from April 17-18. Nigerian authorities failed to confirm whether this mystery illness was the Chinese coronavirus, but the report fueled speculation that the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Kano and in Nigeria far exceed the numbers released by the government.

Yesterday, the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in southwestern Nigeria’s Ogun State announced the start of a three-day warning strike effective from Monday over the deficient welfare package. ARD said the strike action followed the alleged refusal of the state government to respond to concerns over the need for an improved welfare package for its members.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-04,Tanzania: President Reveals 'Imported' Test Kits Give False Results,"Tanzanian President John Magufuli denounced imported coronavirus test kits as faulty after he said they returned positive results for samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw, a fruit similar to papaya, Reuters reported on Sunday.

The testing kits had “technical errors,” Magufuli said during an event in Chato in northwestern Tanzania on Sunday. The president added that the coronavirus testing kits had been imported from abroad but did not say from where.

Magufuli said he told Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the imported kits. They randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a sheep, a goat, and a papaya, but assigned them human names and ages.

According to the president, these samples were then submitted to a Tanzanian laboratory to test for the coronavirus. Laboratory technicians were not told that these were not human samples.

Samples from the papaya and the goat tested positive for coronavirus, Magufuli said.

He added that this meant it was likely that some people in Tanzania were falsely testing positive for coronavirus.

“There is something happening. I said before we should not accept that every aid is meant to be good for this nation,” the president said. According to the report, Magufuli said he wants the imported testing kits investigated.

In recent weeks, several countries around the world including the United States, Australia, Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands have rejected coronavirus medical equipment imported from China as defective.

On April 21, Indian health authorities told states to stop using coronavirus testing kits imported from China after a scientific investigation concluded they were wildly inaccurate. This rejection of Chinese-made goods by India was a demonstration of “prejudice” according to the Chinese embassy in New Delhi last week.

“It is unfair and irresponsible for certain individuals to label Chinese products as ‘faulty’ and look at issues with pre-emptive prejudice,” Chinese embassy spokeswoman Ji Rong said in a statement.

Last month, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) called on the world to “stop smearing Chinese [coronavirus] assistance” in an article published in the state-run newspaper Global Times.

“I think the quality issue reported by some media has been politicized. They can’t prove the reported testing kits have quality issues, because the use and transport [of the kits] may influence their stability and sensitivity,” an employee at Beijing Beier Bioengineering, a test kit provider, told the newspaper.

In Tanzania, Magufuli’s government has drawn criticism in recent weeks for failing to take the coronavirus pandemic seriously. In March, he said Tanzanians need prayer, not medical masks, to protect themselves from the coronavirus.

Tanzania has not taken extensive measures against the coronavirus pandemic yet, unlike most other African nations. Markets, public transportation, and shops remain open in the country, although schools and universities have been closed.

On April 29, a prominent Tanzanian lawyer was arrested for saying the coronavirus was “serious” and “a real threat” to the nation. News of the arrest came amid accusations from a Tanzanian opposition leader that Magufuli’s government was hiding the true number of coronavirus cases and deaths, both believed to be much higher than reported.

At press time on Monday, Tanzania had officially reported 480 infections and 16 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/tanzania-president-says-faulty-imported-test-kit-claimed-goat-coronavirus/

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-05-03,"Islamists Massacre 12 Christians, Kidnap Bride and Groom from Wedding","Muslim Fulani raiders in north-west Nigeria slaughtered 12 Christians and kidnapped a couple from their church wedding ceremony in recent days, Christian Today reports.

In late April, Fulani militants killed seven Christians in three separate attacks over five days in Rafi County, including the execution of two Christians in Gidigori village on April 20th.

A group of Islamists also stormed a church in Shiroro County where a wedding was taking place on April 12th, kidnapping the bride and groom along with some other church members.

“As the pastor was officiating during the wedding solemnization, the herdsmen stormed the church and took away everyone who was unable to escape from the church building, including the bride and groom,” said area resident Danjuma Iliya.

“In that village, five Christians were killed in the series of attacks carried out by the herdsmen.”

Armed Fulani herdsmen also abducted Emmanuel Iliya Agiya, elder and treasurer of the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) in Jema’a County on April 22nd.

The raiders reportedly fired shots into the air to scare local villagers before breaking into Iliya’s house and leading him away at gunpoint.

“The armed herdsmen first tried to forcefully gain entry into the house of the brother of the victim but were unsuccessful,” said Aku Joshua Shai, an eyewitness to the attack. “They then proceeded to the next house, the victim’s house, dragged him out, and then took him away at gunpoint.”

Shai added that in the same county, armed Fulani militants attacked Zakkan village on April 14, killing one Christian, 40-year-old Abel Danjuma, and wounding two others.

“The three victims are members of the Catholic Church at Zakkan village,” Shai said. “The herdsmen, too, blocked the Abuja-Jos route at Zakkan village and kidnapped two young girls who were travelling from Abuja to Taraba state. The girls were later rescued and set free by Christians from Zakkan village who went in pursuit of the herdsmen and rescued the girls.”

The U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom included Nigeria in its shortlist of “Countries of Particular Concern” (CPC) in its 2020 report released last week, asserting that the nation is guilty of engaging in or tolerating “particularly severe” violations of religious freedom.

Likewise, in December 2019, the State Department named Nigeria to its Special Watch List (SWL) for severe violations of religious liberty.

['Dr. Susan Berry'],2020-05-05,Report: Connecticut Nursing Homes Hardest Hit by Coronavirus Had Prior Serious Infection Violations,"A Connecticut media outlet’s investigation of inspection reports for nursing homes hit by large numbers of coronavirus cases reveals the facilities were likely to have prior federal infection control violations and other serious problems months before COVID-19 hit the state.

CT Mirror reported Monday results of its analysis of inspection reports and evaluations for nursing homes with a significant number of residents infected with COVID-19 showed the facilities were more likely to have had prior serious infection control violations, staffing level problems, and poor inspection grades than those with no cases of coronavirus.

According to the report:

Among the facilities where at least 10% of the residents have COVID-19, just over half recorded “below or much below average” ratings compared to one-third of the homes without the virus. And while it is not universally true, the homes fined or cited for violations are the ones now most likely to be hardest hit by COVID-19.

Currently, 58 percent of all coronavirus-related deaths in Connecticut have occurred in nursing homes. About 1,250 nursing home residents are believed to have already died in the state due to the COVID-19 infection.

CT Mirror’s data reflected overall ratings from federal inspections of nursing homes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

The analysis showed 34 percent of all Connecticut nursing homes had below average inspection ratings, compared to 40 percent of facilities in which 10 percent of residents have been infected with COVID-19. In nursing homes in which none of the residents have the infection, 26 percent scored below average prior to the pandemic.

In Waterbury, for example, 33 elderly or disabled at Abbott Terrace Health Center became ill with a “respiratory outbreak” last summer – months before a pandemic was declared.

“Within two weeks, one out of every six residents had contracted the illness,” CT Mirror reported.

In July, federal inspectors found serious violations at Abbott Terrace, including failure by staff to wash hands or switch gloves between work with residents or after changing soiled bedding.

Even after the last inspection, staff at the facility were never trained in how to control the spread of infection, said the report.

Currently, Abbott Terrace has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 infection in the state, with the number of residents with the infection having spiked from 69 to 120 in just two weeks.

CT Mirror reported in April nursing home workers and their union leaders said the state has not provided them with sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) or adequate funding.

The report noted that unannounced inspection visits by the state Department of Public Health, the Connecticut National Guard, and CDC officials are occurring.

Gov. Ned Lamont (D) has reportedly said the staffing problems at the facilities are isolated and most of them now have sufficient PPE.

However, the report noted spokespersons for Lamont and the state’s public health department did not appear to know the status of the inspection reports or their conclusions.

“The governor makes orders all the time,” the governor’s spokesman, Max Reiss, reportedly responded. “Is he supposed to sit behind his desk and go through 50 reports? No. There’s no governor doing that.”

Nursing homes and the policies governing them are coming under more pronounced scrutiny as the elderly are more vulnerable to becoming infected with the COVID-19 respiratory illness.

In New York last week, the New York Post reported state officials allowed nursing home staff known to be infected with the coronavirus to remain at work with residents in a facility in rural Steuben County.

On March 25, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) issued a directive ordering nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients.

“ No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19,” the directive stated . “NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.”

While Cuomo has since said nursing homes may tell state Department of Public Health officials they cannot accept COVID-19 patients or transfer them to other facilities, some reported the state did not respond to their concerns.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/report-connecticut-nursing-homes-hardest-hit-by-coronavirus-had-prior-serious-infection-violations/

['Robert Kraychik'],2020-05-04,Rep. Mike Johnson: Relax State Licensing Requirements to Help Economic Recovery,"Relaxing state-issued occupational licensing regulations should be included in the economic recovery policy linked to the coronavirus outbreak, said Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA), offering his remarks on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak.

Johnson highlighted state-issued occupational licensing for hairstylists and florists as examples of “ridiculous” economic restrictions.

“Look at my home state of Louisiana,” Johnson said. “We’re one of the worst. You have to get a license to braid hair in Louisiana. You have to get a license to arrange flowers in a vase to be a florist. It’s ridiculous.”

“Onerous” government regulations obstruct economic mobility, noted Johnson. He said, “So many states have [governments that are] so onerous. The burdens are so great [that] the people don’t have any mobility. The whole goal of our tax policy and economic policy should be more economic mobility for more people because that’s how you climb up to the next rung on the proverbial ladder, and that’s how you achieve the American Dream.”

Johnson continued, “But increasingly, over the decades, the American Dream has been pulled further beyond the grasp of more people. Our goal — what we should be doing right now in earnest — is bringing that back within everyone’s grasp, and something as simple as these occupational licensing [regulations], it sounds like a minor point, but it’s a big deal.”

Johnson went on, “Some of these occupational licensing [regulations prevent] healthcare workers, for example, [from working] across state lines. We ought to eliminate some of that, particularly in the time of a pandemic when everything’s brought into focus. If some of these very qualified persons who are licensed in one state were allowed to operate in a neighboring state — at least at certain times and under certain conditions — we would be a lot better suited to address all these problems were facing.”

Americans would broadly support the elimination of occupational licensing regulations of the aforementioned variety. “There are a lot of ideas like that, that if you presented it to the average American, they would nod their heads in agreement and say, ‘Of course, we should do that. Why don’t we well?’

Relaxing occupational licensing mandates are a part of the Republican Study Committee’s — a caucus of congressional conservatives — 37-point economic recovery proposal, noted Johnson.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2020/05/04/rep-mike-johnson-relax-state-licensing-requirements-to-help-economic-recovery/

['Pam Key'],2020-05-05,CNN’s Bash: Trump Claim Dems Want Death ‘Absolutely Ridiculous and Reprehensible’,"Tuesday on CNN, political correspondent Dana Bash said President Donald Trump accusing the Democrats of wanting him to be unsuccessful in his coronavirus pandemic response, which would mean more death was “absolutely ridiculous and reprehensible.”

When asked by reporters about not allowing Dr. Fauci to testify before the House, Trump said, “Because the House is a setup. The House is a bunch of Trump haters. They put every Trump hater on the committee. The same old stuff. They, frankly, want our situation to be unsuccessful, which means death, which means death.”

Bash said, “One thing I really want to touch on that the president mentioned at the beginning, which may seem like Washington stuff, but it is so important. It helps to answer that very question you just asked me, which is congressional oversight. The fact that the president is so flagrant and open in the notion that he’s not allowing anybody from the administration to testify before the House because the House is run by Democrats is ridiculous. And it flies in the face of the Constitution, what is required of Congress. Yes, Fauci is going to go before the Republican-controlled Senate next week. And that committee is run by a very fair-minded Republican, Lamar Alexander, but the idea that even now the president just doesn’t care about basic checks and balances in the Constitution is remarkable. Elections have consequences — Democrats took control of the House, period.”

Anchor Jim Sciutto said, “He’s choosing his oversight. He’s saying I’ll allow the oversight from the Republican-controlled Senate but not the Democratic-controlled House. He said House Democrats, specifically, I believe, want the U.S. response to the coronavirus to be unsuccessful, which he said means death. That’s quite a charge, is it not, to level at House Democrats?”

Bash responded, “Of course it is, and it’s ridiculous. It’s absolutely ridiculous and reprehensible that he’s doing that. And he’s doing it as he is, we should note, getting on his helicopter and his plane and going to Arizona, a very important battleground state for his reelection. The first time he’s doing this in a very long time and taking a risk in doing so. He’s very clear he’s done with staying at the White House. We’ll see if this is just the beginning of other changes and if the rallies in some way, shape or form that he loves will start again.”

It helps to answer that very question you just asked me, which is congressional oversight. The fact that the president is so flagrant and open in the notion that he’s not allowing anybody from the administration to testify before the House because the House is run by Democrats is ridiculous. And it flies in the face of the Constitution, what is required of Congress. Yes, Fauci is going to go before the Republican-controlled Senate next week. And that committee is run by a very fair-minded Republican, Lamar Alexander, but the idea that even now the president just doesn’t care about basic checks and balances in the Constitution is remarkable. Elections have consequences — Democrats took control of the House, period.”

Anchor Jim Sciutto said, “He’s choosing his oversight. He’s saying I’ll allow the oversight from the Republican-controlled Senate but not the Democratic-controlled House. He said House Democrats, specifically, I believe, want the U.S. response to the coronavirus to be unsuccessful, which he said means death. That’s quite a charge, is it not, to level at House Democrats?”

Bash responded, “Of course it is, and it’s ridiculous. It’s absolutely ridiculous and reprehensible that he’s doing that. And he’s doing it as he is, we should note, getting on his helicopter and his plane and going to Arizona, a very important battleground state for his reelection. The first time he’s doing this in a very long time and taking a risk in doing so. He’s very clear he’s done with staying at the White House. We’ll see if this is just the beginning of other changes and if the rallies in some way, shape or form that he loves will start again.”

['Trent Baker'],2020-05-05,Azar: Trump’s Reopening Recommendations ‘Based on the Soundest Scientific Evidence and Modeling’,"Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar weighed in on the report of a draft report from FEMA and the CDC predicting up to 200,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by June 1.

With many questioning President Donald Trump’s push to reopen the country, Azar told Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” he has not seen the report and it has not been reviewed by the White House, adding the president’s recommendations on reopening the U.S. economy are “based on the soundest scientific evidence and modeling” rather than draft projections.

“So, I’ve not seen that report,” Azar advised. “I’ve heard about it, obviously. There are hundreds of models that are drafted up to look at various contingencies out in the private-public health world, as well as within our agencies. This apparently is a draft modeling a report of various contingencies prepared by Johns Hopkins. This was not reviewed by the White House or senior leadership or the task force. The president’s recommendations on reopening the American economy are based on the soundest scientific evidence and modeling and forecasting, not draft initial projections that just are floating out there.”

He added, “We actually rely on especially the University of Washington’s model has been quite influential, as well as other work that Dr. Deborah Birx leads, to make sure we’re relying on the soundest, validated, scientific, epidemiological information.”

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-05,"Democrat PAC Sues Florida Officials, Calls for Eased Restrictions on Mail-in Voting","The Democrat PAC Priorities USA filed a lawsuit against Florida officials — including Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Attorney General Ashley Moody (R), and Secretary of State Laurel Lee (R) — over the state’s voting laws, contending that certain changes need to be made to make mail-in voting easier for the upcoming November election.

The PAC joined others, including the Florida Alliance for Retired Americans and Alianza for Progress, in challenging certain provisions they believe makes it more difficult for voters to mail in a ballot. They argue that November’s election will bring what Politico described as an “unprecedented spike in demand for mail-in ballots and a reduction of poll workers and elections staff,” citing coronavirus-related concerns.

The groups specifically take aim at the deadline for mail-in ballots, contending that officials should count ballots postmarked by Election Day. They also view the basic requirement for postage as too burdensome. That, in itself, “amounts to a poll tax,” and the “voter assistance ban imposes unreasonable restrictions on speech and the right of association,” Politico explained.

“No Floridian should ever be forced to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote,” Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil said in a statement, attributing his call for these changes to the coronavirus.

“Our country faces a once in a lifetime health crisis, local and state leaders need to make sure that every Florida voter has full, equal, and safe access to the ballot box in November,” he added.

The lawsuit coincides with a similar legal challenge lodged by the Dream Defenders and New Florida Majority, which filed a lawsuit in March, demanding officials to extend the vote-by-mail deadline for the primary. With the primary behind Florida voters, the groups have now modified their complaint:

The activists amended their complaint this month to focus on changing protocols for the upcoming elections and to add a group of new plaintiffs, including the LGBTQ+ youth advocacy group Zebra Coalition and Young, who is president of the Florida Council of the Blind. The new complaint expands the scope of the lawsuit to demand that the state provide more options for people with disabilities and language barriers, expand early voting locations and dates, provide a better online voter registration system, and improve the vote-by-mail process so that it doesn’t disenfranchise groups who have historically had their mailed ballots rejected.

The lawsuits come as progressive dark money groups increase their shadowy efforts to politicize the coronavirus and, specifically, use the fear surrounding the crisis to gain ground on the liberal universal vote-by-mail agenda.

Priorities USA has, in many ways, taken the lead on the vote-by-mail effort, teaming up with the anti-Trump group Organizing Together in airing ads touting their agenda.

As Breitbart News reported:

Trump’s reelection campaign this month slammed an attack ad by the Soros-backed Priorities USA Super PAC, which criticized Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic “by using deceptively edited quotes from briefings and the news media,” as Breitbart News detailed. That effort — the focused criticism of the president — has now been coupled with what has, until now, remained the left’s dormant scheme to push universal vote-by-mail, which Republicans warn drastically increases the chances of voter fraud and compromises the integrity of elections.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), along with a host of her progressive counterparts, is calling for the next stage of coronavirus relief to include provisions for universal vote-by-mail.

“This is the lifeblood of our democracy, the vote. So here we are trying to protect the lives of American people, the livelihoods of the American people, and also the life of our democracy,” Pelosi said last month.

“That is what we are going to do in the next bill as well,” she vowed.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/democrat-pac-sues-florida-officials-calls-for-eased-restrictions-on-mail-in-voting/

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-04,Michelle Obama: Black Americans Not Voting in 2016 was a ‘Slap in the Face’,"Former first lady Michelle Obama says in her upcoming Netflix documentary Becoming that it was a “slap in the face’’ that black Americans failed to show up to vote in the 2016 presidential election, according to the New York Post.

“It takes some energy to go high, and we were exhausted from it … when you’re the first black anything,’’ Obama said, referring to her and her husband, former President Barack Obama, of their failed efforts to help election then-Democrat White House nominee Hillary Clinton.

“You know, the day I left the White House, it was painful to sit on that stage, and then a lot of our folks didn’t vote — it was almost a slap in the face,” the former first lady added.

“It wasn’t just in this election, but every midterm, every time Barack didn’t get the Congress he needed, that was because our folks didn’t show up,” she said during another point in the film. “After all that work, they just couldn’t be bothered to vote at all. That’s my trauma.”

During the highly-anticipated documentary, Obama also shoots down the prospect of returning to politics — even as calls grow for former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, to select the former first lady as his running mate.

“Now we’re out of the White House, not to be viewed, judged and parceled by every other person on the planet — yeah, it’s better, it’s absolutely freeing,’’ said Obama. “Being the first lady has been the greatest honor of my life. But how many people are in that position where the entire attention of everything is you, every gesture you make, every blink of an eye is being analyzed?

“Barack and I are not interested in being at the forefront forever — not even for that much longer,’’ she added

The film, described as “an intimate look into the life of former first lady Michelle Obama” chronicles her 34-city book tour in 2018-2019 for her best-selling memoir “Becoming.” Obama’s promotional tour, managed by the concert promoter Live Nation, had the scale of a rock tour, with a string of dates at sold-out arenas.

The film will debut May 6 on Netflix. In a statement, Obama said the experience of the tour “drove home the idea that what we share in common is deep and real and can’t be messed with.”

“We processed the past and imagined a better future. In talking about the idea of ‘becoming,’ many of us dared to say our hopes out loud,” said Obama. “I treasure the memories and that sense of connection now more than ever, as we struggle together to weather this pandemic, as we care for our loved ones, tend to our communities, and try to keep up with work and school while coping with huge amounts of loss, confusion, and uncertainty.”

['Edwin Mora'],2020-05-05,First Week of Ramadan Deadlier than 2019,"Islamic terrorists, mainly the Taliban, were responsible for 185 fatalities and 188 injuries during the first week of Ramadan, a time when extremists believe martyrdom and jihad are exceptionally rewarded in paradise, a Breitbart News tally revealed.

That means, on average, terrorists killed about 26 people each day during the first full seven days of the holiest week for Muslims — April 24 to 30. During that same period, there were 60 terrorist attacks that took place in 13 countries, resulting in a total of 373 casualties, including fatalities and injuries.

That translates to over 50 casualties each day during the holiest month for Islam adherents.

As it has done in the last three years, Breitbart News will provide regular updates on the carnage during Ramadan, which began at sunset on April 23 in most countries and will last through sundown on May 23.

The first full day of fasting fell on April 24, the first day Breitbart News began its count.

While several countries and regions have put their citizens on some form of lockdown, including Kabul, the coronavirus pandemic plaguing the globe has not slowed the war in Afghanistan.

So far, the deadliest group during the ongoing month of Ramadan is the Afghan Taliban, responsible for 130 deaths, or nearly 70 percent of all fatalities during the first week. Afghan Taliban jihadis are also behind over 75 percent (144) of all injuries.

As a result of the Taliban’s relentless attacks, Afghanistan is so far the deadliest country of the holy month, home to 40, or about two-thirds, of all 60 documented assaults during the first week of Ramadan.

The Taliban rejected a U.S.-backed Ramadan truce offered by Afghanistan, reportedly saying a ceasefire is “not rational” as they ramp up attacks on the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) and civilians.

At the end of February, the United States and the Taliban narco-jihadis signed an agreement calling for the conditions-based withdrawal of American and foreign military forces.

Even as the Taliban ramps up attacks, the first phase of the withdrawal of foreign forces is already underway, a U.S. reconstruction watchdog noted last week. America is reportedly working on bringing the number of American troops in the war and pandemic-ravaged country to well below 10,000. American troops invaded Afghanistan in October 2001.

Despite the demise of its so-called caliphate in March 2019, the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates continue to wreak havoc, responsible for 36 deaths and five injuries during the first days of Ramadan, primarily in Iraq.

“The terrorist activities of Daesh [Islamic State] have increased during Ramadan [Muslims’ holy month],” Nihad Mohammed, a spokesperson for the police in Iraq’s Diyala province, declared.

The jihadi group continues to operate outside the Middle East. On April 27, an ISIS-linked man in France rammed his car into two police motorcyclists, seriously injuring them.

There was also one ISIS-linked attack each in Egypt, the Philippines, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Although to a much lesser extent, other jihadi groups have also been carrying out attacks during Ramadan, including Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis in Yemen, and the al-Qaeda-linked Hayyat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS).

Even with the fall of the ISIS caliphate in 2019, the first week of Ramadan this year is deadlier than in 2019. Jihadists killed at least 165 people and injured another 145 in the first week of that year.

Jihadist groups and other Islamists are known to urge their members and supporters to engage in jihad on Ramadan, believing that martyrs will get extra rewards in paradise. Despite these attempts, the vast majority of Muslims solely abide by Ramadan’s fasting tradition: abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset.

Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website in coordination with news and government reports.

Given that news outlets and governments fail to report many of the terrorist attacks in real-time, the casualty total for the first week is subject to change.

Government officials may also update some of the casualty totals as some of the injured victims succumb to their injuries.

All the terrorist attacks so far during Ramadan 2020, as documented by Breitbart News, include:

At the end of February, the United States and the Taliban narco-jihadis signed an agreement calling for the conditions-based withdrawal of American and foreign military forces.

Even as the Taliban ramps up attacks, the first phase of the withdrawal of foreign forces is already underway, a U.S. reconstruction watchdog noted last week. America is reportedly working on bringing the number of American troops in the war and pandemic-ravaged country to well below 10,000. American troops invaded Afghanistan in October 2001.

Despite the demise of its so-called caliphate in March 2019, the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates continue to wreak havoc, responsible for 36 deaths and five injuries during the first days of Ramadan, primarily in Iraq.

“The terrorist activities of Daesh [Islamic State] have increased during Ramadan [Muslims’ holy month],” Nihad Mohammed, a spokesperson for the police in Iraq’s Diyala province, declared.

The jihadi group continues to operate outside the Middle East. On April 27, an ISIS-linked man in France rammed his car into two police motorcyclists, seriously injuring them.

There was also one ISIS-linked attack each in Egypt, the Philippines, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Although to a much lesser extent, other jihadi groups have also been carrying out attacks during Ramadan, including Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis in Yemen, and the al-Qaeda-linked Hayyat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS).

Even with the fall of the ISIS caliphate in 2019, the first week of Ramadan this year is deadlier than in 2019. Jihadists killed at least 165 people and injured another 145 in the first week of that year.

Jihadist groups and other Islamists are known to urge their members and supporters to engage in jihad on Ramadan, believing that martyrs will get extra rewards in paradise. Despite these attempts, the vast majority of Muslims solely abide by Ramadan’s fasting tradition: abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset.

Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website in coordination with news and government reports.

Given that news outlets and governments fail to report many of the terrorist attacks in real-time, the casualty total for the first week is subject to change.

Government officials may also update some of the casualty totals as some of the injured victims succumb to their injuries.

['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-05-05,Coronavirus Returns Long-Banned Drive-in Movie Shows to Iran,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — The new coronavirus pandemic has brought back something unseen in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution: a drive-in movie theater.

Once decried by revolutionaries for allowing too much privacy for unmarried young couples, a drive-in theater now operates from a parking lot right under Tehran’s iconic Milad tower, showing a film in line with the views of hard-liners.

Workers spray disinfectants on cars that line up each night here after buying tickets online for what is called the “Cinema Machine” in Farsi. They tune into the film’s audio via an FM station on their car radios.

With stadiums shut and movie theaters closed, this parking-lot screening is the only film being shown in a communal setting amid the virus outbreak in Iran, one of the world’s worst. Iran has reported more than 98,600 cases with over 6,200 deaths, though international and local experts acknowledge Iran’s toll is likely far higher.

“It was very fascinating, this is the first time this is happening, at least for people my age,” said Behrouz Pournezam, 36, who watched the film along with his wife. “We are here mostly for the excitement to be honest, the movie itself didn’t matter that much. I didn’t care what movie it is or by whom or which genre.”

The film being shown, however, is “Exodus,” produced by a firm affiliated with Iran’s hard-line Revolutionary Guard. The film by director Ebrahim Hatamikia focuses on cotton farmers whose fields die from salt water brought by local dams. The farmers, led by an actor who appears to be the Islamic Republic’s answer to American cowboy stand-in Sam Elliott, drive their tractors to Tehran to protest the government.

There is precedent for this anger. Iran had built dams across the country since the revolution — especially under hard-line former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — that environmentalists blame for damaging waterways and farmland. But this film instead involves “a peasant protest against the local authority that symbolically resembles President Hassan Rouhani’s government,” the state-owned Tehran Times said.

Rouhani, a relative moderate in Iran’s Shiite theocracy, has increasingly faced hard-line criticism amid the collapse of his nuclear deal with world powers. Those allied with his administration have criticized the film.

Moviegoer Atefeh Soheili, however, was glad just to enjoy entertainment outside of her home.

“Now I’m sitting here with clean hands and if I want to eat something or relax I don’t need to worry about distancing from other people,” she said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/05/coronavirus-returns-long-banned-drive-in-movie-shows-to-iran/

Kurtz met with several world leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and all agreed to take preventative measures against the spread of the coronavirus, including wearing masks and undergoing tests.

On Monday, Netanyahu announced the easing of lockdown restrictions.

['Frances Martel'],2020-05-04,Health Minister: Iran 'Outperformed' World Powers on Coronavirus,"Iranian Health Minister Saeed Namaki applauded his country in a post Monday on Twitter, claiming that Iran – among the countries with the highest coronavirus infection and death rates in the world – “outperformed the most powerful countries” in the world, presumably among them the United States and China.

The Iranian government claims that, at press time, it had documented 98,647 cases of Chinese coronavirus cases in the country. Among those, Tehran claims 6,277 people have died. These numbers have been the source of much controversy, however, as local officials have repeatedly questioned Tehran’s numbers and journalists have noted that the sum of regional coronavirus case numbers is much higher than the national number. The dissident National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), which has kept its own tally of coronavirus figures based on intelligence from within the country, claims nearly 40,000 people have died since the outbreak began in the holy city of Qom.

Iranian officials tasked the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, with national coronavirus response. The IRGC claimed to be working on a vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus in March, despite being an armed criminal gang with no known history of pharmaceutical development.

“By God’s grace and with the sacrifices made by my colleagues, we have outperformed the most powerful countries in the fight against coronavirus,” Namaki posted on Twitter, according to Iran’s Tasnim News Agency. Namaki noted that Iran had to contend with a “financial crunch” – an attack on the U.S. sanctions placed on the country in response to its repeated violations of international law and, specifically, the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal – and has fought the virus with a much smaller budget than those “who have spent billions of dollars.”

Elsewhere this weekend, Namaki asserted that Iran had successfully controlled the outbreak.

He did not identify any country by name, leaving open-ended if his critique of other countries was meant merely for overt enemies like the United States, or also for nominal allies like China. While the Iranian government applauded China for its handling of the crisis and claimed to receive humanitarian aid for some time, Health Ministry officials appeared to turn on the Communist Party in April.

“It seems statistics from China was a bitter joke because many in the world thought this is just like influenza, with fewer deaths,” Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said last month. “This [impression] were based on reports from China and now it seems China made a bitter joke with the rest of the world … If in China they say an epidemic was controlled in two months, one should really think about it.”

Iranian Center for HIV/AIDS head Minoo Mohraz also accused China that month of “slacking” on providing data regarding the number of people affected by its epidemic.

“Wrong data leads to wrong results and incorrect policies which in turn lead to in an increase in the number of victims,” yet another health official in Iran, coronavirus task force member Hamid Souri, said at the time, referring specifically to China’s “wrong data.”

Chinese statistics on the outbreak in the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, were used to form the academic models that governments throughout the world heeded in making policy to save lives. Ample evidence has surfaced that China has falsely deflated the number of cases in the country. One study suggested that the real number of people infected in China is as much as 100 times larger than the one the Communist Party reported.

Despite having already admitted to using faulty Chinese numbers to orchestrate its response, the government of Iran announced on Monday that it was planning to share its alleged expertise to help other countries end their regional outbreaks. Aqa Mohammadi, a member of Iran’s Expediency Council, which advises Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, claimed that “several countries have asked for Iran’s successful experiences in battling coronavirus as well as effective use of public capacities in this field” and that they would soon receive an organized response. Health Ministry officials, state media claimed, had announced plans to export coronavirus testing kits around the world.

Mohammadi also claimed that Iran’s response to the pandemic had occurred in the “best form possible.”

Jahanpour – who has previously criticized the Iranian regime for, among other things, holding mass public funerals creating the sort of crowds that governments around the world have been trying to prevent from gathering – announced a rise of over one thousand newly identified cases in the 24 hours between Sunday and Monday. Health Minister Namaki has claimed the outbreak would be controlled by late May at the latest in Iran.

President Hassan Rouhani announced the reopening of most mosques in what Iran is calling “white” areas – those with low density of coronavirus cases – on Monday. Among the bigger challenges Iran has faced in controlling the outbreak is the fact that Islamic clerics have openly defied social distancing measures, urging mobs to unite against the government and demand religious sites remain open. It is currently Ramadan, the holiest month of Islam and one that requires greater participation in mosque activities. The mosques are expected to attract large crowds on Friday, the traditional day of mosque prayers.

And so, they’ve chosen to go after China. Look, there’s a lot to criticize China about. I don’t want to make any mistakes about that. They should have been far more transparent about the human-to-human transmission, and they did conceal things, but whether they can get the intelligence agencies to somehow search for the conclusion they want to reach, that’s not how the agencies are supposed to work, and there’s a danger in the administration either putting out theories that cannot be substantiated or deliberately provoking a fight during the middle of a pandemic.”

['Neil Munro'],2020-05-04,Report: Labor Department Cheats American Graduates,"President Donald Trump’s Department of Labor cheats many millions of American graduates by allowing employers to import foreign contract workers at below-market wages, says a May 4 report by the Economic Policy Institute.

“DOL lets H-1B employers undercut local wages,” said the report, titled “H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels.” The report continues:

Sixty percent of H-1B positions certified by the U.S. Department of Labor are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation. While H-1B program rules allow this, DOL has the authority to change it—but hasn’t.

The H-1B program allows employers to import roughly 100,000 foreign graduates each year, just as 800,000 young Americans graduate from colleges with skilled degrees in business, health care, design, software, and science.

The labor department allows companies to import their foreign workers — mostly from poor India — under cheap, no-benefits contracts. This policy undercuts U.S. graduates who must earn higher salaries to pay off debts to expensive U.S. colleges, pay U.S.-level health insurance, and buy houses in U.S. districts made expensive by the annual inflow of immigrants.

The report says:

In fiscal 2019, a total of 60% of H-1B positions certified by DOL had been assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation: 14% were at H-1B Level 1 (the 17th percentile) and 46% were at H-1B Level 2 (34th percentile).

The report urges the labor department to protect Americans by raising the minimum wages that must be paid to the visa workers:

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has broad discretion to set H-1B wage levels, that is, the minimum wage employers must pay their H-1B workers, which corresponds to the H-1B workers’ occupation and the region where they will be employed. By law, DOL must set four H-1B wage levels—which it does according to wage survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment Statistics survey. DOL has set the two lowest levels (of the four) well below the local median wage. … Changing program rules to require and enforce above-median wages for H-1B workers would disincentivize the hiring of H-1B workers as a money-saving exercise, ensuring that companies will use the program as intended—to bring in workers who have special skills—instead of using the H-1B as a way to fill entry-level positions at a discount. … We recommend that DOL use its existing authority to set the lowest (Level 1) wage to the 75th percentile for the occupation and local area and also require that wage offers to H-1B workers never be lower than the national median wage for the occupation.

Eugene Scalia heads the department of labor. The visa programs are overseen by the department’s Wage and Hour Division, which is now run by a former counsel for President Geoge W. Bush.

The visa programs have helped to suppress salaries for college graduates for at least 20 years. Since 2000, wages for the top ten percent of U.S. college graduates have only grown 15 percent, while wages for average graduates have grown just 8.8 percent, according to a February report by the EPI.

On April 22, Trump directed his deputies to recommend changes to the visa workes programs so that Americans can regain jobs as the economy recovers. Unsurprisingly, business groups oppose any curbs on the visa worker programs.

George W. Bush is backing estb.'s soft-focus PR #AllofUS campaign for unity, b/ his economic director spilled the beans:

""We don’t want [Trump’s] temporary [immigration] policy to become permanent.""

Investors & progressives unite for extra migrants. #H1Bhttps://t.co/SaNsCK9x8V — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) May 4, 2020

The overall population of H-1B contract workers is roughly 900,000. They are imported alongside a wide variety of other contract workers, including OPTs, CPTs, L-1s, J-1s, TNs, E-3s, and B-1s. The resident population of white-collar visa workers is roughly 1.5 million.

Roughly 53,000 employers use the H-1B outsourcing program, but most of the foreign workers are imported by a few Fortune 500 companies, according to the report.

While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B program in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019. … Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa. … … Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major U.S. firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple, and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill.

The elite employers use the program to undercut salaries for American graduates by using foreign contract workers at the lowest of the four levels. The report says:

Amazon and Microsoft each had three-fourths or more of their H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2.

Walmart and Uber had roughly half of their H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2.

IBM had three-fifths of its H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2.

Qualcomm and Salesforce had two-fifths of their H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2.

Google had over one-half assigned as Level 2.

Apple had one-third of its H-1B positions assigned as Level 2

The report spotlights the potential for companies to spike their stock market value by slashing their payroll costs with an imported workforce.

But the EPI report ignores many hidden costs of the H-1B program that are also ignored by business groups.

For example, numerous Americans say the existence of this vast foreign worker population blocks many young Americans from getting starter jobs at Fortune 500 companies, reduces salaries for millions of U.S. graduates, and degrades Americans’ professional careers into a series of unstable monthly “gig” contracts.

The supply of subsidized foreign white-collar labor also allows business school executives to degrade the workplace authority and free speech of innovative American professionals, to subordinate the development and reliability of technology to the priorities of foreign workers and also to subordinate technological quality to the demands for quarterly profits by U.S. and Indian CEOs and investors.

These hidden costs are ignored by the Silicon Valley companies, whose many visa workers at helping them the competition against Chinese companies. For example, Eric Schmidt, one of the former H-1B advocates at Google, is calling for a Valley bailout that would provide yet more H-1B visa workers:

Trump’s directions to his agency leaders to reconsider the visa programs will start a fight within the White House as reforms try to get Americans into the Fortune 500 jobs and investors’ lobbyists try to protect their supply of cheap labor.

['Neil Munro'],2020-05-04,Bloomberg News: Import More Migrants Because Americans Can’t Get It Done,"The United States will need even more immigrants once the economy has recovered from the coronavirus crash, according to the editorial board of Mike Bloomberg’s news site.

“The U.S. will need to bring in more foreign talent, not less, to fill labor shortages in critical fields, notably health care, and to promote innovation,” the editorial board of Bloomberg.com claimed.

“The [post-crash] goals should be to increase immigrant admissions overall, while prioritizing skills over family ties, strengthening border security, and providing a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country,” said the board.

The board strongly supports the federal policy of subsidizing investors and companies with an annual inflow of one million legal immigrant consumers, renters, and workers.

The annual inflow of one million legal immigrants is boosted by the resident army of roughly two million imported contract workers — including H-1B and H-2B workers — plus at least one million temporary workers, plus at least eight million illegal migrants. Every year, this imported population of roughly 45 million people helps investors by cutting wages and raising rents for the four million young Americans who enter the labor force.

Bloomberg’s media company uses the H-1B program to import many immigrant software experts and journalists. This inflow helps Bloomberg to minimize the payroll he offers to American graduates and journalists.

The Bloomberg board also linked their editorial to a pro-migration study by Bloomberg’s advocacy group, dubbed New American Economy.

But political pressure from native-born Americans and from many legal immigrants is pushing President Donald Trump to gradually reduce the inflow of legal immigrants, even after he has successfully blocked large-scale illegal migration from Mexico. On April 22, Trump announced curbs on legal immigration and directed his agency chiefs to draw up plans for cutbacks to the visa worker programs by late May.

Many Fortune 500 companies and many billionaire investors strongly back the federal government’s policy of inflating the labor supply with migrants and visa workers. To block Trump, they have now launched a hard-nosed lobbying campaign and a soft-focus PR campaign in cooperation with various allies, including left-wing groups and former President George W. Bush. The campaign is also supported by Bloomberg and by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

The board’s editorial did make one minor concession to public opinion, saying, “with unemployment soaring, some tailored, temporary restrictions on immigration can be justified.”

In his brief $1 billion campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination, Mike Bloomberg repeatedly insisted that the United States needs to import more immigrants for employers. In January, Breitbart News reported:

“This country needs more immigrants and we should be out looking for immigrants,” Bloomberg told the San Diego Union-Tribune on January 5. “For those who need an oboe player for a symphony, we want the best one. We need a striker for a soccer team, we want to get the best one. We want a farmworker, we want to get the best one. A computer programmer, we want to get the best one. So we should be out looking for more immigrants.” … “If business were able to hire without restrictions from anywhere in the world, pretty much every [American’s] occupation would be foreignized,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. He continued: “Americans would have to accept dramatically lower earnings, whether they object or not. Not just landscapers and tomato pickers, [because] Indians and Chinese by the millions can do nursing and accounting. There would not be any job that would not see its earnings fall to the global average.”

Bloomberg’s board acknowledged that the public opposes their demand for yet more wage-cutting, rent-raising migrants. “Sensible reform this side of November’s election already looked unlikely; the pandemic has made it all but unthinkable,” the board said.

That view is shared by one of Bloomberg’ op-ed columnists, Noah Smith. He wrote April 27, that “We pro-immigration people [have] lost, thanks to external events, the rabid insane commitment of the anti-immigration forces, and the natural ending of the immigration wave.”

In an exclusive interview with Alexander Marlow on SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Daily, Sessions said it is critical that lawmakers defend the interests of unemployed Americans who have been laid off due to forced business closures spurred by the Chinese coronavirus crisis.

LISTEN:

“We have 30 million unemployed … We don’t have jobs in the United States,” Sessions said. “There are no jobs now. We’ll lay off more people this week then we did last week.”

“Why would we bring in foreign workers to take jobs when we don’t have jobs for the American people,” Sessions asked. “What theory is it that they’re operating under when they try to justify such a policy position? It’s certainly not in the interest of the American people. It’s in the interest of their corporate friends and some ideology that they adhere to … so I do think that it’s time for this Congress to deliver on its promises that the president made in the campaign.”

Sessions said more Republican lawmakers must be stepping up to the plate to take on China, holding the communist regime accountable for wrecking the U.S. economy. A select committee in the House and Senate, Sessions said, ought to be formed to determine the truth behind China’s role in spreading the coronavirus to the world.

“Where are the rest of the Republicans? Where are they? I mean this is a big issue,” Sessions said. “This party owes it to the American people to defend our interests — American interests. And I don’t think there’s been near enough action.”

“I would think the first thing we need to do is to rally the people who understand the significance of this and have what I call for, is a select committee to study this pandemic and how it started,” Sessions continued. “We did that after the attack on Pearl Harbor … where House and Senate appoint select members of congress … and the charge is what did China know and what did they do, when did they act on it or not, and did they lie about it? The world needs to know.”

As Breitbart has reported, existing U.S. legal immigration law greatly benefits China. Visa programs such as the EB-5 visa for wealthy foreign investors, the F-1 student visa, and J-1 visas allow about 180,000 Chinese nationals to enter the country every year in addition to the 60,000 to 70,000 Chinese nationals who secure green cards annually.

There are nearly 500,000 Chinese students in the U.S. in any given year — more than any other nation — taking seats in university classrooms and looking to eventually obtain Optional Practical Training (OPT) authorization to take entry-level jobs in white-collar professions.

['John Binder'],2020-05-04,Men Accused of Child Rape Among 830 Inmates Freed in Massachusetts,"Two men accused of raping children are among the nearly 830 Massachusetts inmates that have been freed in the last month over concerns of the Chinese coronavirus crisis spreading in prison facilities.

Convicted child rapist Glenn Christie, 54-years-old, and 29-year-old Matthew Parris, accused of raping two teenage girls this year, have both been released from Massachusetts prisons after the state’s supreme court has ordered the routine release of hundreds of accused and convicted criminals.

As of April 26, Massachusetts officials have released 824 inmates from state prisons since April 3. This means that the state is releasing about 36 inmates every day with no end in sight, all in an effort to empty jails to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

There are about 11o confirmed cases of the coronavirus among inmates in Massachusetts prisons out of more than 310 inmates tested for the virus. A total of 81 correctional officers and 23 other staffers in the state prison system have also tested positive.

Christie is one of the inmates set free thanks to the court order. In 2018, Christie was convicted for repeatedly raping a 12-year-old boy.

Parris, also freed from prison thanks to the court order, was arrested less than two months ago and charged with raping and sexually assaulting two teenage girls.

According to the charges, Parris had been working as a teaching assistant at Southeastern Regional Vocational Technical High School when he contacted a 15-year-old student through Instagram. The two met at a local cemetery, according to police, and Parris allegedly attempted to kiss her and touch her breast. The victim said Parris gave her a bag with a sex toy in it before she fled.

More than a week later, police said Parris threatened and forced the girl to perform oral sex on him in the middle of a school day inside a closet. A second victim told police that Parris had similarly contacted her through Instagram.

When the two met in person, police said Parris forced the girl to perform oral sex on him and threatened the victim’s family. A day later, police said Parris forced the girl to get undressed in his car before driving to a location where he allegedly sexually assaulted her.

Parris had already pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated statutory rape, rape of a child with force, and kidnapping of a child.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-04,NBC News Chairman Andy Lack Stepping Down,"NBC News Chairman Andy Lack will leave his post by the end of the month as part of a corporation-wide shake-up, NBCUniversal’s chief executive announced in a Monday memo to the news organization.

NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell wrote that the company’s news organizations — NBC News, MSNBC and CNBC — will be folded into one group, which will be overseen by NBCUniversal International Group chairman Cesar Conde. Top executives who will now report to Conde include NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC chief Phil Griffin, and CNBC chairman Mark Hoffman. Lack planed to depart from NBC News after the 2020 presidential election, according to Deadline.

“Cesar is a well-respected, strategic leader who has succeeded in multiple roles at NBCUniversal since joining the company in 2013,” Shell said in a statement. “Most recently, Cesar has overseen unprecedented growth at Telemundo, which under his leadership has become the number one Spanish-language network, and through its news division has played a critical role in the expansion of news operations, breaking news coverage and trailblazing political reporting. Cesar’s valuable and relevant experience leading broadcast networks and news divisions, combined with his high degree of integrity and proven management skills, make him the right person to lead our news group into the future.”

Lack came under fire following a 2018 New York Times report alleging that NBC News covered up a rape accusation against now-convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein by refusing to greenlight a Ronan Farrow expose. Farrow ultimately took the story to the New Yorker and later won a Pulitzer Prize with The Times for their reporting on Weinstein. “One of the men tasked with reviewing Farrow’s reporting—a key executive under Lack—was himself an accused sexual harasser, multiple sources told The Daily Beast. Under Lack’s tenure, NBCUniversal paid the accuser nearly $1 million for her silence,” the Daily Beast reported at the time. Lack denied the claims, stating Farrow’s reporting wasn’t ready to be published at the time and said he was not involved in any effort to ban the report’s release.

In a separate Daily Beast report, Lack was accused of ignoring several allegations of sexual harassment while he was CEO of the music label Sony BMG.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2020/05/04/nbc-news-chairman-andy-lack-stepping-down/

['Tom Fitton'],2020-05-04,Fitton: Judicial Watch Exposes Deep State Leaks to Washington Post,"Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a distinguished public servant, was briefly national security advisor to President Trump until allegations surfaced in the Washington Post that he had been in communication with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.

Flynn’s lawyers alleged in a November 1, 2019, court filing that James Baker, the Pentagon’s Director of the Office of Net Assessment, “is believed to be the person who illegally leaked” the transcript of Flynn’s December 29, 2016, telephone calls with the ambassador to David Ignatius, a Washington Post reporter.

We went to court to uncover the details, and we now have received 143 pages of records from the Department of Defense that reveal extensive communications between Baker and Ignatius.

The Washington Post published Ignatius’ account of the calls on January 12, 2017, setting in motion a chain of events that led to Flynn’s February 13, 2017, firing as national security advisor, and subsequent prosecution for making false statements to the FBI about the calls.U.S. Attorney John Durham is reportedly investigating the leak of information targeting Flynn.

Citing “the government’s bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement,” Flynn’s attorney, Sidney Powell, moved in January 2020 to withdraw Flynn’s 2017 guilty plea during the Mueller investigation. Flynn claims he felt forced to plead guilty “when his son was threatened with prosecution and he exhausted his financial resources.” Last week, prosecutors provided Flynn’s defense team with documentation of this threat, according to additional papers Flynn’s lawyers filed on April 24, 2020, in support of the motion to withdraw.

We obtained the records in our November 2019 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the DOD failed to respond to a September 2019 request (Judicial Watch v. Department of Defense (No. 1:19-cv-03564)). We were seeking:

All calendar entries of Director James Baker of the Office of Net Assessment.

All records of communications between ONA Director James Baker and reporter David Ignatius.

The communications we requested occurred May 2015 through September 25, 2019.

The records we have received include an exchange on February 16, 2016, with the subject line “Ignatius,” in which Baker tells Pentagon colleague Zachary Mears, then-deputy chief of staff to Obama Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, that he has “a long history with David” and talks with him regularly.

In an email exchange on October 1, 2018, in a discussion about artificial intelligence, Baker tells Ignatius: “David, please, as always, our discussions are completely off the record. If any of my observations strike you as worthy of mixing or folding into your own thinking, that is as usual fine.” Ignatius replies, “Understood. Thanks for talking with me.”

Here are Ignatius and Baker’s email exchanges by year:

In 2015, Ignatius and Baker had a total of seven email conversations to set up meetings or calls, two simply to compliment one another and one exchange where Ignatius invited Baker to speak at the Aspen Strategy Group conference.

In 2016, Ignatius and Baker had a total of 10 email exchanges to set up meetings or calls and two to compliment each other.

In 2017, Ignatius and Baker had a total of 10 email exchanges to set up meetings, one exchange where Ignatius forwarded one of his articles, and one exchange where Ignatius asks Baker for his thoughts on the JCPOA (the Iran nuclear deal), because Baker wasn’t available on the phone.

In 2018, Ignatius and Baker had a total of nine email exchanges to set up meetings, four where Ignatius forwarded articles and one where Ignatius asks Baker for tips on what to say at a quantum computing conference where he was speaking.

These records confirm that Mr. Baker was an anonymous source for Mr. Ignatius. Mr. Baker should be directly questioned about any and all leaks to his friend at the Washington Post.

In a related case, in October 2018 we filed a FOIA lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense seeking information about the September 2016 contract between the DOD and Stefan Halper, the Cambridge University professor identified as a secret FBI informant used by the Obama administration to spy on Trump’s presidential campaign. Halper also reportedly had high-level ties to both U.S. and British intelligence.

Government records show that the DOD’s Office of Net Assessment (ONA) paid Halper a total of $1,058,161 for four contracts that lasted from May 30, 2012, to March 29, 2018. More than $400,000 of the payments came between July 2016 and September 2017, after Halper reportedly offered Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos work and a trip to London to entice him into disclosing information about alleged collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.

Flynn’s attorney told the court that Baker was Halper’s “handler” in the Office of Net Assessment in the Pentagon.

In an interviewwith Lou Dobbs, I discussed the possibility that Judge Emmet Sullivan would look at all of this and throw the Flynn case out or that Attorney General William Barr would cancel the prosecution. “Flynn was ambushed,” I say in the interview. “He is the victim of a coordinated leak campaign.”

I know that President Trump is taking a good hard lookat this. While the FBI is under renewed scrutinyover its disgraceful handling of the Flynn matter, it’s clear we need to look closely at the Defense Department as well.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/04/jfitton-judicial-watch-exposes-deep-state-leaks-to-washington-post/

['Aaron Klein'],2020-05-04,Gov. Ron DeSantis: Media Should Apologize for Causing ‘Frenzy’ Over Beach Reopenings,"Gov. Ron DeSantis suggested members of the national news media should apologize to mayors in Duval County, Florida for hyping criticism of decisions by local jurisdictions to reopen some beaches in mid-April.

The beaches in Duval County were reopened only under social distancing rules.

Seventeen days later, DeSantis presented data that shows Duval County remains among the lowest of the state’s major metropolitan areas when it comes to new Coronavirus cases.

He also showed graphs depicting significant declines in coronavirus hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and the use of ventilators in Duval County.

“I think apologies can be sent to the city of Jacksonville attention Mayor [Lenny] Curry,” said DeSantis, addressing members of the national media. “You may want to CC the mayors of Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach and Atlantic Beach. But I won’t hold my breath on that happening.”

“The facts are that since this has happened hospitalizations, ICU, rate of positivity, [patients on] ventilators — that has all declined. Those people were wrong and the folks in Duval County behaved appropriately,” he added.

DeSantis called on reporters to focus on the “truth” instead of causing a “frenzy” and “allowing things to get carried away.”

Watch his presentation here:

In mid-April, out-of-state media had a spasm because Duval County opened its beaches for recreational use. Now 17 days later, have the fears of this drive-by smear against Floridians been realized?https://t.co/UcXSUk2xcw — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 4, 2020

As he was speaking, a screen showed alarmist headlines about the beach reopenings in the New York Times, Washington Post and other newspapers as well as an image from a critical segment on the topic aired on Anderson Cooper’s CNN show.

“#FloridaMorons trends after people flock to reopened Florida beaches,” was the title of a Washington Post piece.

CBS News critically reported that “Mayor Lenny Curry reopened beaches and parks in Jacksonville, Florida on Friday, after Governor Ron DeSantis gave the green light for them to reopen, despite the state hitting a record number of coronavirus cases.”

The New York Times, Washington Post and other media outlets used similar images that show many people walking on a Jacksonville beach. It not clear from the pictures whether those photographed were violating the social distancing rules. The closeup images seem to show people keeping distance but those who can be seen were not wearing masks or other face coverings

“Of course, you look at the photo that is used. It’s like get that lens right in that area so it looks like there are so many people crowded out there,” DeSantis quipped.

Many of the same national media outlets critical of DeSantis and Duval County politicians had nothing to say about the decision by three Democratic governors at around the same time — New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont – to reopen marinas and boatyards also under social distancing rules.

There has also been a lack of criticism about Manhattan’s Central Park being open to the public while visitor centers and playgrounds have been closed until further notice. People magazine recently published photographs showing crowds in Central Park clearly breaking the “six feet apart” guidelines, with many not wearing face masks.

The beach reopenings in northeastern Florida controversially led to Miami Herald metro columnist Fabiola Santiago tweeting that Florida residents packing beaches “should work nicely to thin the ranks” of supporters of President Donald Trump and DeSantis.

Santiago later deleted the offending tweet and issued an apology. Mindy Marques, publisher and executive editor of the Miami Herald, also issued an apology and said the newspaper would “follow up internally.”

Meanwhile, DeSantis presented numbers from Duval County since the beach reopenings showing hospitalizations for coronavirus down 28%, ICU admissions down 50% and ventilator use down 32%, according to data reported to the AHCA Emergency Status System.

The governor showed a graph of case positivity rate that has not seen major spikes and has trended in a promising direction. This while local mainstream media reported in recent days that Duval County remains the lowest among the state’s major metropolitan areas for new positive cases.

The Florida Times-Union paper, for example, reported:

Duval County continues to record positive tests at a rate of 4 percent. That remains the lowest of the state’s largest metropolitan areas: Miami-Dade County has recorded 14 percent positive tests thus far, while Broward and Palm Beach counties both report 10 percent positive and Hillsborough and Orange counties are both at 5 percent.

['Aaron Klein'],2020-05-04,Gov. Ron DeSantis: Media Should Apologize for Causing ‘Frenzy’ Over Beach Reopenings,"Gov. Ron DeSantis suggested members of the national news media should apologize to mayors in Duval County, Florida for hyping criticism of decisions by local jurisdictions to reopen some beaches in mid-April.

The beaches in Duval County were reopened only under social distancing rules.

Seventeen days later, DeSantis presented data that shows Duval County remains among the lowest of the state’s major metropolitan areas when it comes to new Coronavirus cases.

He also showed graphs depicting significant declines in coronavirus hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and the use of ventilators in Duval County.

“I think apologies can be sent to the city of Jacksonville attention Mayor [Lenny] Curry,” said DeSantis, addressing members of the national media. “You may want to CC the mayors of Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach and Atlantic Beach. But I won’t hold my breath on that happening.”

“The facts are that since this has happened hospitalizations, ICU, rate of positivity, [patients on] ventilators — that has all declined. Those people were wrong and the folks in Duval County behaved appropriately,” he added.

DeSantis called on reporters to focus on the “truth” instead of causing a “frenzy” and “allowing things to get carried away.”

Watch his presentation here:

As he was speaking, a screen showed alarmist headlines about the beach reopenings in the New York Times, Washington Post and other newspapers as well as an image from a critical segment on the topic aired on Anderson Cooper’s CNN show.

“#FloridaMorons trends after people flock to reopened Florida beaches,” was the title of a Washington Post piece.

CBS News critically reported that “Mayor Lenny Curry reopened beaches and parks in Jacksonville, Florida on Friday, after Governor Ron DeSantis gave the green light for them to reopen, despite the state hitting a record number of coronavirus cases.”

The New York Times, Washington Post and other media outlets used similar images that show many people walking on a Jacksonville beach. It not clear from the pictures whether those photographed were violating the social distancing rules. The closeup images seem to show people keeping distance but those who can be seen were not wearing masks or other face coverings

“Of course, you look at the photo that is used. It’s like get that lens right in that area so it looks like there are so many people crowded out there,” DeSantis quipped.

Many of the same national media outlets critical of DeSantis and Duval County politicians had nothing to say about the decision by three Democratic governors at around the same time — New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont – to reopen marinas and boatyards also under social distancing rules.

There has also been a lack of criticism about Manhattan’s Central Park being open to the public while visitor centers and playgrounds have been closed until further notice. People magazine recently published photographs showing crowds in Central Park clearly breaking the “six feet apart” guidelines, with many not wearing face masks.

The beach reopenings in northeastern Florida controversially led to Miami Herald metro columnist Fabiola Santiago tweeting that Florida residents packing beaches “should work nicely to thin the ranks” of supporters of President Donald Trump and DeSantis.

Santiago later deleted the offending tweet and issued an apology. Mindy Marques, publisher and executive editor of the Miami Herald, also issued an apology and said the newspaper would “follow up internally.”

['Simon Kent'],2020-05-04,"W.H.O. Continues to Obey China, Ignores Taiwan Coronavirus Success","Taiwan has “not yet” received an invitation to join a meeting this month of the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) lead decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, the government said on Monday.

The island state’s government said it would still strive to take part regardless, ABC News in Australia reported.

China forced Taiwan out of the global body in 2016 after the election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist. It has blocked every effort since for Taiwan to regain even observer status at W.H.O.’s annual policy meeting, insisting Taiwan should not receive any considerations or honors that would be afforded to a full nation-state.

Taiwan’s exclusion from W.H.O. membership has understandably infuriated Taipei, which says its absence has created a glaring gap in the global fight against the coronavirus.

Taiwan has been praised for its handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. According to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University, Taiwan has 436 confirmed coronavirus cases and only six deaths.

In March, assistant director-general at the W.H.O., Bruce Aylward, dodged a journalist’s question on Taiwan’s pariah status, confirming allegations the world body was too deferential to China. Watch that exchange below:

﻿

The W.H.O. said last week that due to the epidemic, the World Health Assembly meeting is expected to take the shape of a three-hour video conference rather than the usual full-blown meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.

According to the ABC report, Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the government had “not yet received an invitation from W.H.O.” for that briefing and was “still awaiting” it so a delegation could share the island’s experience in fighting the outbreak.

Meanwhile Australia is pushing ahead with its call to have Taiwan return to the W.H.O. fold, as Breitbart News reported.

Last Friday an Australian ministry spokesman said the global coronavirus pandemic needed a global response, and there should be a close working relationship between the W.H.O. and all “health authorities,” including Taiwan.

Australia is not alone in seeking immediate reformation of the ailing body:

C-SPAN

The nation should be able to participate as an observer or a guest, the spokesman added, and on the evidence would add value to an organization in drastic need of reform.

The government of Taiwan attempted to warn the U.N.-led W.H.O. of the deadly potential of the Wuhan coronavirus as far back as December 2019, but the W.H.O. failed to share Taiwan’s findings on the virus with the world, the country’s U.S. office confirmed to Breitbart News last month.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/05/04/w-h-o-continues-to-obey-china-ignores-taiwan-coronavirus-success/
['Breitbart News'],,Intel Report: China Hid Coronavirus’ Severity to Hoard Supplies,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak — and how contagious the disease is — to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that China was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric against China coincides with administration critics saying the government’s response to the virus was inadequate and slow. President Donald Trump’s political opponents have accused the president and his administration of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

The analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by “denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data,” the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus “was a contagion” for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad — and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China’s changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report.

Trump has speculated that China could have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible “mistake.” His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, “Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories.”

['Matthew Boyle'],2020-05-03,Congressman: Pelosi Blocking Investigation into China Coronavirus Origins,"Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) told Breitbart News this weekend that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would rather investigate President Donald Trump again than focus on the actual origins of the Chinese coronavirus and U.S. tax dollars that went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology from which intelligence officials increasingly believe the virus leaked.

Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Reschenthaler discussed his efforts to investigate tax dollars that flowed through a New York firm to the Wuhan lab. He said that Pelosi and House Democrats are not interested in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable and, instead, want to focus their oversight efforts on politically harming President Trump again just like they tried and failed with the partisan impeachment last year and earlier this year.

“We should have an investigative body looking at these grants, but Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that,” Reschenthaler said. “So you have myself and House Republicans. I can tell you I’m going to continue to look into these grants. I’m going to continue to look into the Department of Homeland Security as well to see what grants are going from there to China. I’m also looking at defunding the World Health Organization and we can talk about that as well. But the bottom line of the Democrats’ behavior is this: They hate this president so badly that they would rather side with the Chinese Communist Party than defend Americans and defend our spending and spend wisely and just be honest. That is their hatred for President Trump and disdain for President Trump’s supporters.”

LISTEN:

Breitbart · Breitbart News Saturday – Rep. Guy Reschenthaler – May 2, 2020 “We should have an investigative body looking at these grants, but Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that,” Reschenthaler said. “So you have myself and House Republicans. I can tell you I’m going to continue to look into these grants. I’m going to continue to look into the Department of Homeland Security as well to see what grants are going from there to China. I’m also looking at defunding the World Health Organization and we can talk about that as well. But the bottom line of the Democrats’ behavior is this: They hate this president so badly that they would rather side with the Chinese Communist Party than defend Americans and defend our spending and spend wisely and just be honest. That is their hatred for President Trump and disdain for President Trump’s supporters.”

Reschenthaler wrote a letter this week to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper inquiring about a Pentagon grant to EcoHealth Alliance, Inc., a New York firm that has had a history of funding the Wuhan Institute of Virology with subgrants from American taxpayers. The Pentagon grant the congressman was inquiring about was for research into bat-borne zoonotic diseases and their potential as weapons of mass destruction or biological weapons. While it is unclear if that grant saw U.S. taxpayer money flowing from it out to the Wuhan lab, it is known that another grant that EcoHealth Alliance received did partially spend U.S. tax dollars in the Chinese lab.

That grant, from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — in particular the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is run by the now-famous Dr. Anthony Fauci — saw U.S. tax dollars sent to EcoHealth Alliance for researching coronaviruses from bats flow out to the Chinese lab in Wuhan. Some of the money went to other labs around the world too, an NIH official confirmed to Breitbart News last week. But the NIH was so concerned about the money and this lab in Wuhan that the government notified EcoHealth Alliance that it would be investigating the matter and that any funds to the Wuhan lab must be halted while the investigation occurred.

“The NIH funded EcoHealth Alliance, which then, in turn, turned around and partially funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Reschenthaler told Breitbart News. “The DOD also gave EcoHealth Alliance $6.5 million in a grant, and like you said, that grant was to understand bat-borne zoonotic disease in context with weapons of mass destruction. So what I’m trying to find out is whether or not the DOD funding that went to EcoHealth also went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We know that the NIH funding did, and we also know that all money is fungible, but I want to see if we can trace that money to Wuhan to see how much and to what extent the DOD and American taxpayers actually funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”

What is perhaps most interesting about all this is how little the Democrats on Capitol Hill seem to care about the origins of the virus in Wuhan, China, or about U.S. taxpayer dollars flowing to this lab in China. Many Democrats have brushed off holding China accountable for the virus and, instead, intend to focus their efforts on attacking President Trump over the Chinese coronavirus. Pelosi, whose Articles of Impeachment effort against Trump failed in grand fashion this year as the U.S. Senate acquitted the president, has even launched the creation of a select committee to investigate the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic — a select committee that Republicans are considering boycotting.

The members Pelosi named to the committee last week are highly partisan Democrats. First and foremost, Pelosi named House Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) — the Democrat who publicly mused that the chaos of the pandemic provided Democrats an opportunity to remake America in their vision — to chair it. Then she named several others directly involved in the failed effort to impeach President Trump, including House Oversight Committee chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and House Financial Services Committee chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). Maloney and Waters chair two of the committees that were involved in the partisan impeachment inquiry of President Trump.

The others — House Small Business Committee chairwoman Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) and Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Bill Foster (D-IL), and Andy Kim (D-NJ) — all voted for impeachment as well. Raskin, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, gained particular prominence during hearings last year.

As such, Rep. Kevin McCarthy — the House GOP leader — has said he does not believe Republicans will participate in the sham investigation because he sees it simply as “another impeachment committee.”

Reschenthaler said on Breitbart News Saturday that if Americans want Congress to have a real investigation into the origins of the Chinese coronavirus and hearings about their tax dollars going to this lab in Wuhan, Republicans would need to retake the House majority in November and commence those hearings next year.

“It’s imperative that we as House Republicans take back the House in this next election because Nancy Pelosi and the far-left Democrats are thwarting everything we do,” Reschenthaler said. “I do have to say I cringe when the media says ‘Nancy Pelosi and the Squad’ because that minimizes how far left this party has gone. It’s just not the Squad. It’s not just Nancy Pelosi. It’s most of their members. Look at the Green New Deal. When that was floated, half of their co-sponsors were on the Green New Deal. Most of these Democrats vote 90 plus percent of the time with [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]. This party has moved drastically to the left to the point of siding with the CCP over Americans. They don’t want to get to the bottom of these grants and they also don’t want my resolution run on the floor about defunding the World Health Organization or at least getting Dr. Tedros to resign and getting an international organization to investigate how the World Health Organization was either grossly negligent in dealing with the Wuhan virus or how they worked hand-in-glove with the Chinese Communist Party in trying to cover up the virus early on. But that’s the extent of their hatred, again, of this president and his supporters where they will not run these bills and they will not do these investigations because, again, they would rather side with the CCP than do the right thing.”

To retake the House majority, Republicans need to win just 18 net seats back from Democrats. There are 30 districts across America that Trump won in 2016 currently represented by a Democrat, so the prospect is very possible that the GOP could flip the House back. In the meantime, however, while Democrats on Capitol Hill dither in partisan politics, the Trump administration and the U.S. Intelligence Community are investigating these matters, Reschenthaler said.

“The Intel Community hasn’t ruled out the virus may have originated in the lab,” Reschenthaler said. “We know that. That’s coming from the Intel Community. We also know that the NIH in a letter to EcoHealth stated that they believe — this is again the NIH letter I’m stating — that they believe the virus may have originated in the lab. That was the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Lab IV. We know that. But I think whether or not this disease came from a bat through a wet market or it came from a lab, we’ve got to see where it originated and we’ve got to see what we can do to make sure we stop these pandemics in the future. That could be something like encouraging other nations to stop interactions at wet markets, which should be happening anyhow. If it originated in a lab and somehow leaked from the lab, we shouldn’t be funding labs that study virology and weapons of mass destruction in terms of biological weapons. We shouldn’t fund these labs unless they have procedures in place where the disease won’t leak out and kill 60,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands around the world. This is a very responsible thing to do as good stewards of taxpayer money.”

Reschenthaler also hopes to get answers as to whether the Chinese Communist Party, while it was getting these U.S. tax dollars into the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was even being forthcoming with U.S. officials about research that was compiled there on such coronaviruses, including potentially the one plaguing the planet right now.

“I’d like to add, as we get to the bottom of this, I’d like to see what information we were getting back from the Institute of Virology in Wuhan because something tells me the Chinese Communist Party was taking the money from EcoHealth Alliance — which was, again, a large part came from the United States and our taxpayers — then doing this research, and I don’t know if they were giving us any actual data or scientific findings from what we were funding,” Reschenthaler said. “They certainly didn’t allow American doctors and scientists into Wuhan at the start of this disease. They’ve kept us shut out for a large part. So I want to see if we were being taken advantage of. I suspect that we were by the Chinese Communist Party, and I want to see in the future, when we do give these grants, there is transparency and we get the research that comes from us funding these labs.”

['Ben Kew'],2020-05-04,Report: Third Russian Health Worker Falls from Hospital Window,"A paramedic who complained about being forced to work after contracting the Chinese coronavirus is currently in critical condition after mysteriously falling from a hospital window in western Russia this weekend.

The Moscow Times reports that 37-year-old Alexander Shulepov fell from the second floor of a hospital in the rural Voronezh and suffered a skull fracture, which has left him in critical condition. Voronezh is located 500 kilometers south of Moscow; he was being treated for coronavirus symptoms.

Police claim to be investigating his fall.

Last month, Shulepov and his colleague Alexander Kosyakin filmed a video complaining that authorities in the Novaya Usman village hospital were forcing him the work despite the fact he had tested positive for the virus. The complaint occurred after reports surfaced that the Kremlin recently forced third-year medical students to work during the pandemic or face academic and professional consequences.

Days later, he reportedly released another video walking back his comments, arguing that he was in an “emotional state.” The video also featured Igor Potanin, the head doctor of the Novousmanskaya hospital, who insisted his medical staff were being provided with sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE).

“I spoke about this to the department’s employees: I won’t let anyone go to outpatients or inpatients if we don’t have enough means of protection, I told them I’d go myself there, but I will not send anyone,” Potanin said in the video.

In a statement to CNN, Kosyakin confirmed details about his colleague’s condition.

“[Shulepov] is an intensive care unit, as far as I know in a serious condition, last time I spoke to him was on the 30th of April, we checked in with each other,” Kosyakin told CNN. “He felt fine, he was getting ready to get discharged from the hospital … and all of a sudden this happened, it’s not clear why and what for, so many questions that I don’t even have the answer to.” Kosyakin reportedly faces criminal charges for violating Russia’s recently passed misinformation law, which carries prison sentences of up to five years for spreading “fake news” about the ongoing pandemic. Russian authorities have reported around 145,000 cases of the virus so far but just 1,356 deaths, an abnormally low number compared with other countries.

Shulepov is the third doctor to have reportedly plunged from a hospital building in the past two weeks, with the other two both dying of their injuries. The most recent of these victims was Elena Nepomnyashchaya, the acting head doctor of a hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, who died days after an alleged fall from a window at the hospital she was in charge of. She had recently complained about her staff being forced to treat coronavirus patients without sufficient PPE.

Dr. Natalya Lebedeva — the head of the emergency medical service at Star City, where the majority of Russia’s cosmonauts are trained — allegedly committed suicide on April 24 by jumping from the building after failing to prevent an outbreak. The hospital called her death a “tragic accident.”

Falling or defenestration from buildings appear to have become a signature manner of death for numerous government dissenters in Russia over the past decade. Before the recent spate of falls, the latest case was that of the 32-year-old investigative journalist Maxim Borodin, thrown out of a fourth-floor window in April 2018 as he was investigating Russia’s military involvement in Syria.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-04,Millions Travel Across China to Celebrate May Day Holiday,"Chinese state media on Monday was brimming with upbeat accounts of travelers crossing the country and flooding into tourist attractions to celebrate May Day, a major holiday for the Communist country.

The energetic celebrations were presented as a milestone in China’s recovery from the coronavirus epidemic.

China’s state-run Xinhua news network put the spotlight on Lieshen, a mountain village that made May Day into a big debut for its rebranding as a rural tourist attraction.

“With the help of local authorities, villagers turn farmhouses into homestay hotels and make rural landscape [into] scenic spots [to] attract tourists,” Xinhua said, using aerial photographs to show how picturesque the town has become, and how satisfyingly full its parking lots were for the May Day holiday.

Another Xinhua article reported over a million visitors at Shanghai’s 130 major tourist attractions during the first two days of the five-day May Day holiday, signaling a “growing travel and leisure demand.”

According to the report, Shanghai tourists are “required to wear face masks, show their health QR codes, and have their body temperatures taken for their safety.” The QR codes are generated by a mandatory health tracking application Chinese citizens must install on their smartphones.

Xinhua counted 23 million domestic trips on the first day of the May Day holiday, generating about $1.38 billion in revenue. 7.37 million of those travelers were packed onto trains, which recorded their highest daily number of passengers since the Lunar New Year holiday in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

About 70 percent of China’s tourist attractions were said to be open, although they were required to operate at no more than 30 percent of their optimum capacity.

China Daily on Monday celebrated tourism in Hubei province, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, “springing back to life.”

Twenty-two major tourist attractions were open in Hubei on Friday, drawing over 520,000 visitors over the weekend for their “first public holiday since the regional lockdown was lifted.” This total was down about 83 percent from May Day 2019 due to the 30 percent capacity limit placed on tourist sites. In Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, tourism was down 58 percent from last year.

China Daily reported Hubei’s government established a special fund to help tourism enterprises resume operations after the lockdown. Private and public institutions have been urged to give their employees a half-day off on Friday every week over the summer to boost tourism. Medical workers who traveled to Hubei to help with the coronavirus emergency have been offered free admission to all tourist attractions for life.

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-04,"In Mandarin, White House Celebrates Chinese Populist Heroes","The White House on Monday further challenged China’s coronavirus response narrative by praising heroes punished by the Chinese government for telling the truth about the coronavirus pandemic.

Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger addressed The University of Virginia’s Miller Center in a video, speaking in Mandarin about the story of Dr. Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old Chinese doctor who was detained by authorities after sounding the alarm about the dangers of the coronavirus on December 31. Skeptics questioned whether physical violence at the hands of Chinese authorities further damaged Li’s health after he emerged from his arrest in a weakened condition.

“Dr. Li wasn’t a demagogue in search of a new ideology that might save China, he was an ophthalmologist and a young father who committed a small act of bravery and then a big act of bravery,” Pottinger said, detailing his story.

Li was detained by Chinese authorities and forced to sign a letter renouncing his remarks.

China’s central government denounced Li’s warning as “rumor-mongering.”

He ultimately went public with his experience with the virus and the Chinese authorities, sounding a warning that reverberated around the globe.

When Li died in February from the virus, he was hailed as a hero in China while Chinese authorities censored the online revolt against the government for silencing his warning.

“The whole world paid close attention,” Pottinger said, calling Li’s death “the loss of a relative for people around the world.”

Pottinger also hailed citizen journalists like Chen Quiushi, Fang Bin, and Li Zehua who went missing after he spread the truth about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.

“When small acts of bravery are stamped out by governments, big acts of bravery follow,” Pottinger said.

Pottinger hailed the modern whistleblowers of the coronavirus as inheritors of the Chinese May Fourth student protest movement of 1919 that resisted oppressive Chinese rulers.

“Let me break the rule against discussing ‘isms’ to ask whether China today would benefit from a little less nationalism and a little more populism,” he said.

He continued:

Democrat populism is less about the left versus right than top versus bottom. It’s about reminding a few that they need the consent of the many to govern. When a privileged few grow too remote and self-interested, populism is what pulls them back or pitches them overboard. It has a kinetic energy.

He cited the 2015 Brexit vote, the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, and Thomas Jefferson’s own Declaration of Independence in 1776 as examples of healthy populism.

“It is an admonition to the powerful of this country to remember who they’re supposed to work for: America First,” he concluded.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/04/in-mandarin-white-house-celebrates-chinese-populist-heroes-telling-the-truth-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-05,"Hong Kong to Reopen Bars, Theaters as Coronavirus Cases Dwindle","Hong Kong will relax limits on gatherings in public places starting Friday, as the city’s number of new Chinese coronavirus cases has not increased since April, Hong Kong news broadcaster RTHK reported on Tuesday.

People will be allowed to go out in public in groups of up to eight. Bars, gyms, cinemas, beauty salons, massage parlors, and various other entertainment venues will be allowed to reopen from May 8, with some restrictions on their operations to remain in place until May 21. Karaoke bars and nightclubs will remain closed for an additional two weeks.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the lifting of restrictions on Tuesday, the same day that the city recorded no new coronavirus cases, with the total number of local infections remaining 1,040. As of Tuesday, Hong Kong had not reported a new local case of coronavirus (non-imported) since April 19.

Before Tuesday’s announcement, people who gathered in groups of more than four in a public place, indoors or outdoors, faced a maximum fine of up to HK$25,000 [U.S. $3224] and six months in prison. This strict measure was put in place starting March 29 when the city was experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, according to RTHK.

Now that Hong Kong’s coronavirus outbreak has seemed to stabilize, the city’s authorities say they are ready to start opening the city back up again.

At a coronavirus pandemic-related briefing titled “Hope on the Horizon” on Tuesday, Lam said it would be “unrealistic” for Hong Kong’s social distancing measures to remain in place until there are no new coronavirus cases whatsoever. She added that people have grown impatient under the city’s lockdown and that businesses have been eager to resume operations.

According to the briefing, restaurants may allow up to eight people to sit at the same table starting Friday, up from four currently. Other restrictions on restaurants, such as spacing tables at least 1.5 meters apart, will remain in place for now. Bars will reopen on Friday, but must operate at 50 percent of their capacity; no live bands or dancing in bars will be allowed for now.

Lam also confirmed an earlier report that Hong Kong schools will reopen in phases beginning May 27.

On April 26, when the ban on large gathering was still firmly in place, hundreds of people converged at a Hong Kong shopping mall for a pro-democracy demonstration. Hong Kong’s local government has grown increasingly authoritarian in recent years, prompting its citizens to organize pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the city in recent months.

King, as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he needs to see the intelligence Trump and Pompeo have, adding if the committee does not get access to it, “then that raises serious questions about the basis of those assertions.”

“I think what we should believe is what the intelligence community is telling us, and I haven’t seen any recent intelligence on this in the last month or so,” King told Berman. “So, you know … if the president and the secretary of state have intelligence on this, then as a member of the intelligence committee I want to see it. I’m entitled to see classified material. there are no limits on that kind of material being shared with the intelligence committees of the Congress. So, it bothers me that for the president and the secretary of state to assert in such certainty, in fact, I think the president said a high degree of certainty without at least sharing with the Intelligence Committee on a closed classified basis what the basis of that is. And like I say, I haven’t seen it. I can’t contradict it, except I’m damn sure going to try to see it over the next week or so. And if we can’t get it, then that raises serious questions about the basis of those assertions.”

['Penny Starr'],2020-05-04,"Official: After Giving Billions to W.H.O., U.S. Can Use Other Partners","Senior State Department officials said on Monday that President Donald Trump’s directive to pause funding the World Health Organization while investigating how the United Nation’s global health agency handled the coronavirus pandemic was justified and that the United States can partner with other non-governmental organizations to implement its foreign aid around the world.

During a conference call with reporters, State Department officials noted that the United States has spent the most money fighting the coronavirus pandemic.

“The United States continues to be the undisputed leader in foreign assistance,” James Richardson, director of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources at the U.S. Department of State, said in opening remarks during the call.

Richardson said that the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have dedicated $775 million in emergency health, humanitarian, economic, and development assistance to fight the coronavirus pandemic, in addition to the $2.4 billion appropriated by Congress.

Richardson said the U.S. represents “49 percent of all government and multilateral assistance” dedicated to the battle against the pandemic.

Breitbart News asked about the United States’ financial contributions to the W.H.O. given the Trump administration’s investigation into the global entity.

“So over the past 20 years, we’ve contributed over $5 billion to the W.H.O.,” a senior State Department official said. “The past 10, that number has been 3.2, and last year we contributed almost $400 million.”

“So, so far the U.S. has used the W.H.O. as an implementing partner around the world for about $40 million of our assistance,” the official said. “So what the president saw was that W.H.O. was was not being an accountable, transparent partner, and as such it’s really important for us to make sure when you do foreign assistance that you always look at who is the best partner in order to get the job done.”

“The president rightfully … has concerns about the W.H.O., and that’s what this review is about,” the official said, adding that there are many other non-government agencies around the globe that can be used as an “implementing partner” aside from W.H.O.

“The W.H.O. is actually a fairly small implementing partner for the United States,” the official said. “We give $18-20 billion worth of health and humanitarian assistance nearly every year.”

“And so with the WHO receiving 400 million of that [last year], that’s like two percent of our total health and humanitarian assistance going through the W.H.O. to implement our programs.”

“We are absolutely committed to making sure every dollar is well spent and well accounted for, and that’s what we’re continuing to do every day with our COVID resources and all the rest of our global health and humanitarian assistance resources,” the official said.

China was only mentioned during the call in reference to how little it contributes globally to humanitarian and other aid but not the role the Trump administration believes W.H.O. played in not disseminating critical data about the coronavirus and its origin and spread inside and outside of that communist country.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-04,"Russia Records 10,000+ Coronavirus Cases for Two Straight Days","Russia’s new coronavirus cases increased by over 10,000 for the second straight day on Monday, the Moscow Times reported, cementing its status as a pandemic hotspot.

Russian health officials confirmed 10,581 new coronavirus infections over the last 24 hours, just 52 fewer than on Sunday, bringing the country’s official number of cases to 145,268. The increase on Monday pushed Russia to the top of the list of European countries reporting the highest number of new cases, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).

On April 30, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin confirmed that he tested positive for coronavirus, making him the highest-ranking Russian official known to have contracted the virus.

“I have just learned that the test on the coronavirus I took was positive,” the prime minister said during a video call with Russian President Vladimir Putin shared on Russian TV.

Mishustin recommended First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov supplant him as he headed into self-isolation and Putin agreed.

“What’s happening to you can happen to anyone, and I’ve always been saying this,” Putin told him. “You are a very active person.”

Mishustin used the opportunity to urge all Russians to take the coronavirus seriously and to stay home as an 11-day, extended May holiday approached.

Russia observes several public holidays in early May, including Victory Day on May 9 to celebrate Russia’s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. This year’s Victory Day marks the 75th anniversary and Putin had planned a major celebration in Moscow’s famous Red Square with world leaders in attendance and a grand military procession.

Russia’s fierce coronavirus outbreak has forced the nation to cancel the parade, which Putin says he has postponed. Instead, military aircraft will fly over major cities to mark the day. On Monday, fighter jets were spotted flying over Moscow, the nation’s capital, as they rehearsed for the event, AFP reports.

The Moscow Times said about half the total coronavirus cases in Russia are located in Moscow. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reportedly said “the threat is apparently on the rise” and urged residents to follow stay-at-home orders and anti-coronavirus measures over the May holidays.

Last week, Moscow said it would begin constructing temporary hospitals to hold a total of 10,000 beds for coronavirus patients, in response to the increased need. Putin also announced last week that the sharp increase in coronavirus cases in Russia has left the country with a shortage of medical gear including personal protective equipment (PPE).

Despite the surge in cases, Russian officials have argued its fatality rate remained relatively low for a country of its size and population. At press time on Monday, Russia had reported 1,356 coronavirus deaths. Russian officials have credited their quick, aggressive actions – such as closing the country’s borders early and allegedly widespread testing and tracking of infections – for what they consider a low number. Despite this, critics have doubted Russia’s officially reported coronavirus numbers in recent weeks.

As many western European countries begin to ease their coronavirus lockdowns, Russia has extended its own until May 11. The Russian government has indicated that, after May 11, it could gradually lift quarantine measures across the country, which include restrictions on people’s movement meant to curb the spread of the virus.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/russia-records-10000-coronavirus-cases-two-straight-days/
['Ben Kew'],2020-05-04,South Korea to Reopen Schools Next Week Following Virus Response,"The government of South Korea announced plans on Monday to reopen schools next week, citing a diminished threat from the Chinese coronavirus.

South Korea has postponed the beginning of the spring semester four times so far since imposing social distancing measures in March. Yet with the average daily number of new cases now close to zero, education authorities said they are ready to start phasing in the renewal of classes based on age group.

Schools are scheduled to reopen across the country starting May 20, two months after the government closed them in response to the pandemic.

“We’re now preparing for the opening of schools while managing the daily risks of the disease,” Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae said at a press briefing Monday. “If a student turns out to be infected with the virus, health authorities will take the necessary action and the school will switch to online classes.”

Experts consider South Korea to have implemented among the most effective responses to the coronavirus, successfully introducing mass testing, intensive contact tracing, and symptom tracking apps aimed at limiting it spread.

Health authorities are nevertheless urging caution to protect the country’s some 5.5 million elementary, middle, and high school students, requiring them to conduct mock drills and drawing up guidelines in the case of any resurgence in infections.

The current plan is for high school students to return to school on May 13 to resume preparation for the highly competitive annual college entrance exam in December. Younger students will resume their studies in stages between May 20 and June 1.

Under the new measures, both students and teachers will be required to wear masks except for during mealtimes, regularly wipe their desks, and maintain distance as they move around the premises. School authorities will also need to carry out the disinfection of surfaces, temperature checks, and the rearranging of seating.

“At our schools, we must adopt a new lifestyle in line with [social distancing rules],” Yoo explained. “Our schools cannot return to the state before Covid-19, and so all us educators must be prepared to operate schools in new ways.”

The government also plans to ease various social distancing restrictions on Wednesday for society as a whole, allowing public services such as libraries and museums to reopen in stages. They are also setting up hundreds of respiratory clinics nationwide as preparation for a potential second wave of infections in the future.

“The plan is to make [these clinics] a model of public-private cooperation,” said Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip at the press conference. “A detailed plan and guidelines will be created in early May in coordination with medical professionals.”

According to official data, South Korea has so far recorded 10,801 cases and 252 deaths, a relatively low figure given its proximity to China. Of that total, at least 9,217 people recovered from the virus, while 1,332 are currently being treated for its symptoms.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-04,Chinese Media: Pompeo ‘Bluffing’ by Linking Coronavirus to Wuhan Lab,"Chinese state media on Monday claimed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was merely “bluffing” when he said on Sunday there is “enormous evidence” that the coronavirus originated at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.

Pompeo made the remarks that infuriated the CCP when Martha Raddatz of ABC News asked if he has “seen anything that gives you high confidence” that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

“Martha, there is enormous evidence that that’s where this began. We’ve said from the beginning that this was a virus that originated in Wuhan, China. We took a lot of grief for that from the outside, but I think the whole world can see now,” Pompeo replied.

“Remember, China has a history of infecting the world and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,” Pompeo continued. He continued:

These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab. And so while the Intelligence Community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

Pompeo also said the “best experts so far seem to think it was man-made.”

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) through its Global Times newspaper demanded to see the evidence Pompeo referred to and accused the United States of engaging in “unprecedented propaganda warfare” by constantly reminding the world where the deadly pandemic came from:

Since Pompeo said his claims are supported by “enormous evidence,” then he should present this so-called evidence to the world, and especially to the American public who he continually tries to fool. The truth is that Pompeo does not have any evidence, and during Sunday’s interview, he was bluffing. The Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The most urgent tasks for international communities are to prevent the virus from spreading and to save lives while restarting the world economy. Ironically, Washington has put forth the weakest efforts in accomplishing the aforementioned tasks. As the US presidential election campaigns are underway, the Trump administration has implemented a strategy designed to divert attention from the incompetence it has displayed in fighting the pandemic. It is clear that their goal is to blame China for the pandemic by pinpointing the country as the source of COVID-19. The origin of the virus is of serious scientific concern. So far, not one world-renowned scientist has accused the Wuhan Institute of Virology of leaking the virus. US intelligence agencies, acting on orders from US President Donald Trump, have been involved with the investigation. Pompeo has recently declared that he has “enormous evidence” about a so-called “lab leak.” As a result, what was originally a scientific question, has been transformed into a vicious attack fueled by politics, intelligence, and diplomacy. Such filthy behavior defies the essence of science to mislead the general public. If Washington has solid evidence, then it should let research institutes and scientists examine and verify it. Another option would be to have intelligence agencies release a detailed report on the origin of the virus, which would help the White House keep its fabrications moving forward. Washington has chosen not to pursue either of those options and instead is utilizing a politician like Pompeo to bluff US society with so-called “enormous evidence.”

The Global Times ranted at length that Pompeo was “sacrificing his credibility as a politician” in a “reckless pursuit” to distract from how terrible the coronavirus epidemic has become in the United States.

Very few health experts outside of China believe the CCP has been truthful at any point during the pandemic in reporting how many infections and deaths it caused. One reason the Chinese government lies with such determination about the scope of the pandemic is so it can claim, as the Global Times did again on Monday, that other countries did a much worse job of fighting the virus than China, and they are only blaming China for unleashing the pandemic to distract from their shortcomings.

Raddatz mentioned another reason the CCP concealed the true scale of the Wuhan virus outbreak during her interview with Pompeo on Sunday: U.S. intelligence officials believe “the Chinese government ‘intentionally concealed the severity of COVID-19 from the international community in early January while it stockpiled medical supplies.’”

“In terms of international concealing, I assume you think they did that intentionally to keep as many masks for themselves as possible?” she asked Pompeo. He replied that she had the facts “just about right.”

Raddatz was referring to a report produced by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on May 1 and described in a report from the Associated Press on Sunday.

The report, which was not classified but was marked “for official use only,” noted that while China was downplaying the severity of the outbreak at the beginning of the year, it also “increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies.”

The DHS report said that China’s “imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply” at the same time it was telling the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) that the virus could not be spread by human contact. Perhaps not coincidentally, W.H.O. has consistently described surgical masks as unnecessary protection for people who are not already infected by the coronavirus, even as China was attempting to monopolize the planetary supply of masks.

For some reason, the AP decided to insert a vague editorial defense of the Chinese Communist Party in the middle of its report on the DHS analysis: “Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government’s missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information and officials hesitant to report bad news. There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world’s medical supplies.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/chinese-media-pompeo-bluffing-linking-coronavirus-wuhan-lab/
['John Hayward'],2020-05-04,Chinese State Media Calls Canada a ‘Giant Baby’ for ‘Bashing’ W.H.O.,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) used its Global Times state newspaper to lash out at Canada on Monday, insulting Canada as a “giant baby” throwing a temper tantrum because it dared to join the United States in “bashing” the World Health Organization (W.H.O.).

The specific Canadian action that enraged the CCP was a summons issued by the House of Commons to Bruce Aylward, a Canadian citizen who works as a senior adviser to W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

The Global Times forgot to mention that the Canadian legislature cordially invited Aylward to address it twice, on April 14 and May 1, and only issued the summons on Friday after those invitations were refused. Canadian members of parliament even said they would be willing to accept a reasonable substitute for Aylward if he is unavailable, but W.H.O. simply declined their invitations.

In the CCP’s mind, any questioning of Chinese influence over the World Health Organization is completely out of bounds, and Canadian politicians would only ask such questions because they seek to curry favor with the evil United States:

Canada is again becoming an accomplice in the US “buck-passing” campaign and scapegoating either WHO or China for its flawed handling of the epidemic to cover up its systematic loopholes. By exerting pressure on high-level medical expert Bruce Aylward, some Canadi-an politicians fawn on the US by expressing their dissatisfaction with the WHO and express doubts about China in dealing with the epidemic in the earlier stage. Like the US, Canada acts like a country with a self-centered “giant baby” mentality who refuses to accept the fact which it is unwilling to believe. The coronavirus had struck a blow to their once vaunted “superior” capabilities in responding to public health crises. The death rate from coronavirus in Canada, higher than that of China, crushed their illusions and sense of superiority. Canada’s deep skepticism reflects its extreme ideological anxiety and frustration.

This has become the standard insulting line taken by the CCP toward all of its critics: foreign officials only accuse China of lying and exerting malign influence over W.H.O. to distract from their own poor response to the coronavirus. China’s coronavirus propaganda campaign certainly could not be mistaken for a diplomatic charm offensive.

The Global Times also insinuated the Canadian legislature is somehow racist and arrogant for wanting testimony from a Canadian who works for W.H.O.:

Their narcissistic view of their own system leads them to expect that all things can go in line with their imagination. If not, they will suspect that there must be something wrong. They are still reluctant to wake up even though such blind confidence has dragged them into chaos and made them bear the consequences. They are pointing a finger at a renowned epidemiologist who led a group of WHO experts to China for a joint mission on COVID-19 in February because Aylward revealed some facts those politicians long balked at. Aylward praised China’s coronavirus prevention work, saying potential patients were well-organized and tested quickly at a press conference in Beijing in February. But some in Canada continue to hold on to their prejudice against China, ignoring some of the key elements of China’s success in fighting the epidemic, which Aylward summarized and applauded. Canada should invite Aylward back to the country for more experience sharing and consultations, but not for being blamed for its own mismanagement.

Taiwan News on Sunday reported that Aylward has been summoned to participate in a “mandatory video conference” with Canadian legislators, during which he will be asked to “explain WHO misinformation on person-to-person transmission of the virus, as well as the use of masks,” a topic upon which W.H.O. has issued some confusing statements.

Taiwan News also mentioned an infamous videoconference interview Aylward had with a Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) reporter in early April. When the reporter asked if the Chinese Communist Party used its influence with W.H.O. to block membership for Taiwan, which has attributed its exemplary success at fighting the coronavirus to ignoring Chinese disinformation passed through W.H.O., Aylward pretended not to hear the question, then flatly refused to answer when it was repeated, and finally disconnected from the interview.

Hong Kong’s Beijing-controlled government later reprimanded RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong for asking Aylward about Taiwan, on the grounds that such questions violate the “One China” principle that treats Taiwan as a Chinese Communist possession.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/chinese-state-media-calls-canada-giant-baby-for-bashing-world-health-organization/

From Fox News:

Last week, reports showed that 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. In the coming months, the national unemployment rate is likely to hit 16 percent — or even higher. There haven’t been this many people out of work in the United States since the Great Depression.

Missouri should be applauded for recognizing the massive harm that CCP has inflicted.

…

American businesses — especially small businesses — are facing an economic crisis we haven’t seen in our lifetimes. The road to recovery will likely be long and rocky. As Missouri Attorney General Schmitt said last week about China, “They are responsible for this and the responsibility lies directly at their feet.”

['David Ng'],2020-05-04,USC Creating COVID-19 Surveillance System That Will Score Citizens,"China launched its notorious social credit system last year to watch over its own citizens and mete out punishment based on personal behavior and loyalty to the Communist Party.

Now three prominent U.S. universities are using taxpayer money to create a similar type of surveillance network designed to monitor Americans and assign them scores based on their exposure to the Wuhan coronavirus.

Tech news outlet dot.LA recently reported that researchers at the University of Southern California, Emory University, and the University of Texas Health Science Center have received a federal grant to create a mobile app for contact tracing the novel coronavirus. The system will track a person’s real-time location and symptoms, and calculate a personal COVID-19 risk score.

USC’s Cyrus Shahabi, chair of the computer science department, told dot.LA that the universities hope to have a working mobile app by August, in time for the start of the fall semester. He said policymakers could use the system to warn the public to avoid hotspots of infection.

In other instances, people who have been assigned high personal risk scores might decide to stay home or get tested for COVID-19.

But the project, whose federal grant money comes from the National Science Foundation, has already raised red flags in terms of privacy and the potential for Big Brother-style abuse.

There needs to be “a careful balance or privacy protection with public health benefits,” Bennett Cyphers, a staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights advocacy group, told dot.LA. “When you introduce ‘scoring’ that takes other factors into account, it complicates everything, and increases the risk that users will be misinformed or discriminated against due to factors beyond their control.”

The assigning of personal scores could also cause problems if an employer requires workers reveal them as a condition of receiving a benefit, entering a building, or returning to their office, Cyphers said.

China’s social credit system has blacklisted more than 13 million citizens as “untrustworthy,” according to a recent report from the state-run Global Times. The report did not say what these individuals did to land on the list, but the regime has revealed the system assigns a numerical score to every Chinese citizen based on how much the Communist Party approves of his or her behavior.

The system has also blocked 23 million Chinese citizens from traveling by train or plane.

Beijing announced the system in 2015 and launched it last year. The system essentially spies on citizens in virtually every aspect of daily life, both online and physically through facial recognition cameras.

Apple and Google announced this year that they are working on a separate Bluetooth application that will provide contact tracing of the coronavirus using smartphone location data.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-04,North Korea Refuses to Explain Exchange of Gunfire with South Korea,"North Korean troops fired several gunshots at a South Korean guard post inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Sunday, prompting the South Korean soldiers to fire a volley of warning shots in response and broadcast a warning against further aggression.

The North Korean regime did not respond to South Korea’s request for an explanation of the incident.

As South Korea’s Yonhap News told the tale on Sunday, South Korean border guards heard gunfire early Sunday morning, emerged from their outpost to investigate, and found four bullet holes in the wall. They responded by firing two volleys of ten warning shots, in accordance with longstanding protocols. No injuries have been reported from the exchange of gunfire.

“We also sent a notice to the North Korean side via the inter-Korean communication line at around 9:35 a.m., and called for its explanation,” a spokesperson for the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said.

As of Monday morning, North Korea has not responded to that request for an explanation. South Korea also used the inter-Korean communication line to advise the North that the actions of its soldiers violated military accords between the two Koreas.

According to South Korean military officials quoted by Joongang Ilbo, the four rounds fired by North Korea “appeared to have a caliber of 14.5 millimeters, meaning they likely came from a Soviet-made heavy machine gun commonly used by North Korea as anti-aircraft weapons.”

Chosun Ilbo quoted a South Korean Defense Ministry official who assessed a “low probability of deliberate provocation” and suggested the shots may have been fired during a period of “low visibility” during the early morning when North Korean forces typically check their weapons. The official further noted North Korean farmers in the area tended to their chores without any disruption and there were no unusual movements by North Korean troops.

“It was the first exchange of gunfire between South and North Korea in years. Under the Comprehensive Military Agreement signed in September 2018, the two Koreas agreed to halt all hostile acts against each other, a move aimed at reducing tensions and building trust,” Yonhap noted.

The United Nations Command (UNC), which enforces the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, said on Monday that it will investigate the incident and will “continue to monitor the situation.” The UNC announced on Monday that it will send a team to the DMZ to investigate the incident.

Both the UNC and South Korean military spokespeople said the North does not appear to have taken any further aggressive action beyond firing those four gunshots into the wall of the South Korean outpost.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Martha Raddatz of ABC News on Sunday that the incident appears to have been an isolated accident.

“We can confirm at least the initial reports are that you’ve described are just about right – a handful of shots that came across from the North. We think those were accidental. The South Koreans did return fire. So far as we can tell, there was no loss of life on either side,” Pompeo told Raddatz.

Pompeo did not speculate on whether the DMZ gunfire incident was related in some way to the reappearance of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, who kept a very low profile for much of April and was rumored to have been incapacitated or killed during heart surgery. Some South Korean media outlets have suggested the shots were fired to send some sort of message in connection with Kim’s reappearance at a fertilizer plant on Friday.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/north-korea-refuses-explain-exchange-gunfire-south-korean-outpost/
['Frances Martel'],2020-05-04,Chinese Media: U.S. Must Listen to ‘Civilized World’ and Stop Questioning Communist Party,"The official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the People’s Daily, disparaged on Sunday the growing number of lawsuits against China for its mishandling of what became the Chinese coronavirus pandemic as a “political farce” and a “shame for human civilization.”

The People’s Daily focused on lawsuits in the United States, specifically those that legal authorities have filed in states like Missouri and Mississippi, despite the fact that multiple nations – including Nigeria, Egypt, and Italy – are entertaining similar legal action against the Chinese communist regime for failing to properly address the outbreak when it began in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in the heart of the country. The state lawsuits may soon be aided by Congressional legislation carving out an exception to China’s sovereign immunity in U.S. courts.

Chinese officials initially reacted to reports of a contagious disease spreading in Wuhan by arresting doctors sharing safety tips online. When it alerted the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to the discovery of a new virus, Beijing falsely claimed it did not spread from person to person, a claim the W.H.O. shared with the world. China also pressured countries not to impose travel restrictions on its citizens to prevent the spread of the virus, though it now claims that only “imported” cases are a threat and strictly curtails entry into the country.

One study found that China properly abiding by international public health law could have prevented as many as 95 percent of its documented coronavirus cases.

The People’s Daily nonetheless railed against legal attempts to hold the country accountable, calling them a “political farce” and an affront on longstanding principles of sovereign immunity.

Many international states, including America, adhere to the principle of sovereign immunity, banning its individual citizens from suing foreign states in court. This principle has exceptions – for example, crimes against humanity and war crimes are typically considered the jurisdiction of any court on earth – and American lawmakers have made it possible for its citizens to sue some states in extraordinary circumstances. The most recent instance of this was a law passed during the tenure of President Barack Obama, over his veto, to allow Americans to sue Saudi Arabia for damages related to the September 11, 2001, jihadist attacks.

Sovereign states can be sued in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but only by other state entities.

White House

In an article titled “U.S. Practice to Claim Compensation for COVID-19 Outbreak a Shame for Human Civilization,” using the W.H.O. name for the Chinese coronavirus, the People’s Daily accuses American officials first of somehow violating international law by noting that the virus originated in China.

“The political farce staged again and again by the U.S., a major country that touts itself as an ‘international leader,’ is astonishing people around the world,” the article asserted.

“U.S. politicians blatantly violated the rules and called the novel coronavirus ‘Chinese virus’ and ‘Wuhan virus.’ While the international society is generally lauding China’s contribution made at huge sacrifice, they are forming cliques for blackmailing,” the People’s Daily accused. “What they have done is an affront to international law and justice. The terms about sovereign immunity in the international law stipulate that the practices and treasure of a country are not bound to the legislation, jurisdiction or administration of other countries.”

“Blatantly trampling upon the sovereignty of other countries and damaging the international rule of law with supremacy, the U.S. is standing on the totally opposite side of international justice,” the column, signed under a penname that implies it is the opinion of the People’s Daily itself, read.

The article then veered into a host of conspiracy theories that have now become regular content in Chinese state media: speculation that the virus originated at a U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland, a vague attempt to tie the pandemic to the use of electronic cigarettes in the United States, and blaming the Wall Street Journal single-handedly for causing the 2008 financial crisis.

“The political manipulation by certain Americans who ignore facts and fabricate data has no moral baseline and deviates from humanity,” the article concluded, urging Americans to listen to “the civilized world” and stop questioning the Communist Party.

The article appears largely to be a response to the Missouri and Mississippi lawsuits, which contend that China must pay redress to Americans hurt physically or economically by the pandemic because the Communist Party could have prevented it from hurting them and chose not to.

“The repeated unlawful and unreasonable acts and omissions of [China] have been injurious to — and have significantly interfered with — the lives, health, and safety of substantial numbers of Missouri residents, ruining lives and damaging the public order and economy of the State of Missouri,” the lawsuit read in part.

The Global Times, another belligerent Chinese state publication, dismissed the lawsuit as “a farce” that has no chance in court because “China’s anti-virus achievements are obvious.” Yet the Communist Party’s mouthpieces have failed to stop publicly fretting about the legal actions.

Outside of America, however, other countries are considering similar action. Last week, the Nigerian law firm Azinge and Azinge announced its intention to bring to court a lawsuit against the state of China seeking $200 billion in damages as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the extensively documented acts of racism against black people in China. The Communist Party has claimed for weeks that foreigners were bringing coronavirus into Chinese communities despite the virus originating in the country, resulting in incidents of restaurants, including a local McDonald’s branch, posting notices that black people would not be allowed on the premises. Han Chinese landlords also enacted a mass eviction of black tenants in southern Guangzhou city.

In perhaps the most damning twist against China, the Communist Party itself allowed a lawsuit to move forward last month against Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak there.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-03,New York Times Op-ed: Dump Biden over Tara Reade Allegations,"The New York Times published an op-ed Sunday evening arguing that Democrats should dump former Vice President Joe Biden as their candidate because of the potential damage of Tara Reade’s allegations against him.

Reade has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in a Senate hallway in 1993; Biden denies the allegations.

In the op-ed, titled “Democrats, It’s Time to Consider a Plan B,” Elizabeth Bruenig argues:

I have my own impressions regarding Ms. Reade’s allegations, but no one — save Ms. Reade and Mr. Biden — knows with certainty whether her claims are true. What I can assert with firm conviction is that Democrats ought to start considering a backup plan for 2020. Ms. Reade’s account is not nearly as incredible as some have argued. In the course of my reporting, I have worked closely with many survivors of sexual assault. It isn’t unusual, in my experience, for survivors to exhibit behavior that seems unstable or erratic to others. They may initially disclose to investigators or journalists only a fragment of what happened, and then reveal more over time — some even falsely recant, either because they sense the police don’t believe them, or because they fear the consequences of pressing their claims. And victims often maintain relationships with their attackers or harbor mixed feelings about them. … Believing women, that oft-rehearsed exhortation, must mean taking action if it’s to mean anything. A thorough and fully transparent investigation is critical, but nothing produced by any inquiry will entirely settle the question. It is still possible — if not likely — that all of this will simply fade away, and that Mr. Biden will continue his campaign without ever submitting to a full accounting, precisely the sort of thing #MeToo was meant to prevent. But it is also possible that this won’t just go away, and that it will demoralize voters and place Mr. Biden at a disadvantage against Mr. Trump in the general election, despite the fact that Mr. Trump has a damning list of accusers alleging sexual offenses. For a candidate mainly favored for his presumed electability and the perception of empathy and decency, that’s a serious liability. To preserve the strides made on behalf of victims of sexual assault in the era of #MeToo, and to maximize their chances in November, Democrats need to begin formulating an alternative strategy for 2020 — one that does not include Mr. Biden.

Read the full op-ed here.

Democrats have thus far rallied around Biden; the Democratic National Committee has rejected a call by the Times editorial board to conduct its own independent investigation of the allegations against Biden.

['Allum Bokhari'],2020-05-05,Jair Bolsonaro’s Son Suspended from Amazon-Owned Streaming Platform Twitch,"Jair Renan Bolsonaro, the fourth-oldest son of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, was suspended from the Amazon-owned video streaming platform Twitch.tv last week after casting doubt on the severity of the Chinese virus pandemic.

According to the Brazillian Report, Renan Bolsonaro compared the coronavirus to “just a little flu,” and encouraged his viewers to go out on the streets.

The 22-year old son of the Brazilian president was broadcasting a match on the popular video game League of Legends. Twitch, which was acquired by Amazon in 2014, is the leading streaming platform for gamers.

“Go to the streets, OK? What pandemic?,” said Renan Bolsonaro. “This is a media invention to lock you inside your home, so you’ll think the world is crumbling. It’s just a little flu, brother.”

This comes after his father was censored by Twitter and Facebook for posting videos of himself speaking to Brazilian voters about the need to balance addressing the pandemic with averting a prolonged economic slump.

In a post on Twitter, the president’s son said that he had been banned “for life.” However, in a statement to Insider, Twitch said that the ban was only temporary.

Fui banido da Twitch para sempre. Interessante é que a rede social mantém perfis que disseminam claramente a misandria (ódio, o desprezo ou o preconceito contra homens ou meninos), mas não suportam uma brincadeira, por mais pesada que fosse. + pic.twitter.com/V6Bf9FHFJw — Renan Bolsonaro (@renan_bolsonaro) May 1, 2020

“In line with our policies on hateful conduct, Renan Bolsonaro has been issued a temporary ban from Twitch for comments made on stream, and the offending content has been removed,” said a Twitch spokesperson, although they did not specify what, if any, of Renan’s comments on Twitch were “hateful.”

Twitch is the latest social media platform to demonstrate that it will punish users who attempt the minimize the danger of the Chinese virus. YouTube recently banned two doctors from Bakersfield, California who suggested an earlier reopening of the country given lower-than-expected mortality rates.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-05,"Harvard Law Prof: Coronavirus Is an Excuse to Dump Free Speech, Property Rights from Constitution","Harvard Law Professor Adrian Vermeule suggests using the Chinese virus pandemic as an excuse to establish a new interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, implementing Marxist policies that do away with concepts such as “free speech ideology” and “property rights.”

Adrian Vermeule, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, recently wrote a piece for the Atlantic in which he argues that traditional interpretations of the U.S. constitution have “now outlived its utility,” and that it is now time for the government to take a more centralized role in people’s lives.

Vermeule argues that “circumstances have now changed” due to the Chinese virus pandemic, and that it is now possible to imagine “moral” constitutionalism, which he says is not “enslaved to the original meaning of the Constitution,” and is also “liberated” from the narrative of “relentless expansion of individualistic autonomy.”

The professor is advocating for a new interpretation of the U.S. constitution, which he refers to as “common-good constitutionalism.”

“Such an approach,” wrote Vermeule, “should be based on the principles that government helps direct persons, associations, and society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in the interest of attaining the common good is entirely legitimate.”

Vermeule also scrutinizes “the libertarian assumptions central to free-speech law and free-speech ideology,” which he says is “forbidden to judge the quality and moral worth of public speech,” and therefore, should “fall under the ax.”

The law professor even goes as far as stating that “property rights and economic rights will also have to go,” because they “bar the state from enforcing duties of community and solidarity in the use and distribution of resources.”

Vermeule claims that this “global pandemic” makes for the perfect opportunity to implement such strategies that grow government, insisting that “it has become clear that a just governing order must have ample power to cope with large-scale crises of public health and well-being.”

The professor also noted that when he says the government should get involved in “health,” he is referring to that “in many senses, not only literal and physical but also metaphorical and social.”

Vermeule even acknowledges that “the central aim of the constitutional order is to promote good rule, not to ‘protect liberty’ as an end in itself,” and that one common-good principle will be “that no constitutional right to refuse vaccination exists.”

“Constitutional law will define in broad terms the authority of the state to protect the public’s health and well-being, protecting the weak from pandemics and scourges of many kinds,” wrote Vermeule.

The professor even goes on to admit that implementing such principles would require overriding “selfish” claims of individuals to private rights, and that his interpretation of constitutional law means that “rulers” should be afforded a “broad scope.”

Vermeule insists that “these principles include respect for the authority of rule and of rulers,” the “respect for the legitimate roles of public bodies and associations at all levels of government and society,” and “a candid willingness to ‘legislate morality,'” among other concepts.

In January, Vermeule’s colleague, chemistry chairman Charles Lieber, was charged with fraud over his private financial relationship with the Chinese government. Lieber was paid millions of dollars by the Chinese government to work on “collaborative projects” between Harvard and the Chinese government.

This week, Republicans in the House of Representatives announced that they have launched an investigation into China’s influence on American universities and colleges.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-05,"Obamas, Lady Gaga to Headline YouTube’s Virtual 2020 Commencement Event","Former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are set to give virtual commencement speeches for the graduating class of 2020, who are forced to celebrate their graduations remotely due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

The boy band BTS and pop star Lady Gaga will also be giving commencement speeches, and there will even be guest appearances by Alicia Keys, Kelly Rowland, Kerry Washington, Chloe X Halle, Zendaya, and more, according to a report by Deadline.

The report added that the virtual commencement ceremony, entitled, Dear Class of 2020, will be a multi-hour event hosted on YouTube on June 6, and will celebrate this year’s graduating students “worldwide.”

“Graduation is a tradition that students and families look forward to and with the current state of the world, YouTube is lending some inspiration in the form of a virtual commencement,” said YouTube’s Susanne Daniels.

“We hope bringing together noteworthy, influential speakers along with performances from some of their favorite artists will provide encouragement for the students who have worked so hard to get here,” she added.

The former president and first lady are expected to deliver their own separate commencement speeches — as well as a joint message — to the graduating high school and college seniors who are forced to watch a virtual ceremony due to the deadly Wuhan coronavirus.

YouTube says that the Dear Class of 2020 is meant for people around the world to come together to celebrate their resilience, as well as the endless possibilities of their future.

“The festival-style line up combines classic commencement day themes with a diverse array of entertainment that will capture all of the emotions of graduation including pride, hope, optimism, and camaraderie,” said YouTube.

Many graduating — and current — students, however, are unsure about their futures, given that draconian measures implemented in response to the Chinese virus have resulted in upended businesses, plunging millions of Americans into unemployment and financial devastation.

An estimated 28 million Americans are canceling or changing their education plans at colleges and universities over the Wuahn virus, which has shaken up the world of academia.

Meanwhile, universities across the country are facing class-action lawsuits filed by students demanding refunds due to the alleged lack of quality in education and services they have received as a result of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

['Ben Kew'],2020-05-05,Steve Carell Reluctantly Takes Command in First Trailer of Netflix’s ‘Space Force’,"Netflix released the teaser trailer for Steve Carell’s new workplace comedy series Space Force on Tuesday, inspired by President Donald Trump’s decision to designate the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the U.S. military.

The series follows the career of the decorated pilot and four-star general Mark R. Naird (Carell), who has long dreamed of leading the United States Air Force but instead finds himself in charge of the newly formed Space Force. It is largely inspired by President Donald Trump’s move to establish the military’s sixth branch back in 2018.

“I’m hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces,” Trump said at the time. “That’s a big statement.”

In the new teaser trailer, Naird is shown struggling to adjust to his new role as one character is heard describing the operation to colonize space as a “complete shit show.” Although Trump is never mentioned by name, the characters are regularly seen laughing or scoffing at the president’s orders.

Space Force stars Lisa Kudrow as Naird’s wife Maggie, who also faces difficulties adjusting to her husband’s new role. Other cast members include John Malkovich, Ben Schwartz, Jimmy O. Yang, Noah Emmerich, Fred Willard, Tawny Newsome, Diana Silvers, Alex Sparrow, and Don Lake.

The 10-episode series, co-created by Carell and The Office showrunner Greg Daniels, is the former’s first television comedy since he departed his role as Michael Scott in the hit NBC sitcom back in 2011.

“We realized that the story had beautiful visuals and a mythic quality, and it echoed some of America’s best moments,” Space Force co-creator Greg Daniels said in a press release.

“It had a lot of heroism and yet it also had a strong satirical element. Suddenly everybody has realized that there are riches to be had on the moon, and we’ve got to stake our claim,” he continued. “It feels like there’s now a scramble to colonize space. The contrast between that and the super hopeful early days of NASA, when it was just such an achievement for all of mankind to get a person on the moon, is a good subject for satire.”

Space Force premieres on Netflix on May 29th.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-04,Nicolas Cage Cast as ‘Tiger King’ Joe Exotic,"Actor Nicolas Cage is expected to play Joe Exotic from Netflix’s hit series Tiger King in a new scripted series about the eccentric zookeeper.

Nicolas Cage is set to star in a new eight-episode scripted series centered around Tiger King‘s Joe Schreibvogel — better known as Joe Exotic — according to a report by Variety.

The report added that the series will be taken to market in the next few days, and is being produced by Imagine Television Studios and CBS Television Studios. The series will be based on an article in Texas Monthly, entitled, Joe Exotic: A Dark Journey Into the World of a Man Gone Wild.

The Tiger King television documentary was released on March 20 and quickly became a cult classic. And now, Cage is staring in what will be the first television role of his career.

The Tiger King character that Cage will star as is an eccentric, exotic zookeeper in Oklahoma who fights to keep his park, according to Variety, which added that the series will also explore how Schreibvogel became “Joe Exotic,” as well as how he lost himself to “a character of his own creation.”

The show’s writer, showrunner, and executive producer will be Dan Lagana, who was also the showrunner for the Emmy-nominated Netflix series American Vandal. Lagana has also worked on the MTV series Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous, as well as the Hulu series Deadbeat.

Paul Young will also serve as executive producer through Make Good Content.

The new show staring Cage is the second scripted series about the strange world of Tiger King, according to Variety. The first spin-off series was announced late last year, and will reportedly star Kate McKinnon as Carole Baskin.

['Lucas Nolan'],2020-05-04,Report: Used Tesla Parts Found for Sale with Previous Owners’ Personal Info Still Loaded,"According to a recent report, Tesla components containing the previous owners’ personal information are appearing for sale online.

A recent report from InsideEVs claimed that Tesla’s retrofitting service for media control units and Autopilot hardware may be failing to properly protect owners’ personal data. A white hat hacker (a term used to describe ethical hackers) named GreenTheOnly obtained four Tesla computers off eBay and found the previous owner’s personal data still on all of them.

Green alleges that he informed Tesla of this before bringing his findings to InsideEVs, but according to Green, Tesla refused to notify all of its customers that could be affected in a timely manner. Tesla has reportedly stated that it will be notifying one of its affected customers but has yet to do so.

According to Green, each of the modules he bought had “owner’s home and work location, all saved wifi passwords, calendar entries from the phone, call lists and address books from paired phones, Netflix and other stored session cookies.” The stored session cookies could give hackers access to private accounts.

It seems that when Tesla owners had their vehicles retrofitted with new computer hardware, the old components containing personal data may currently be for sale on eBay. The first generation MCU computers, MCUv1, had issues with excessive logging which caused the computer to fail within four to five years.

The MCUv2 allegedly fixed this issue and was made available in the United States on March 3. Green alleges that MCUv2 units are also failing due to manufacturing issues with the EMMC chip, but all of the computers are involved in the current privacy issue are the original MCU units.

For Tesla’s Model 3 vehicle, the ICE computer on older cars often needs to upgraded if the owner purchases Tesla’s Full Self Driving (FSD) package. Green obtained three ICE computers from Tesla Model 3 cars and one MCUv2 from a Model X vehicle, he outlined the process stating:

“Prices on eBay for these units started to drop from more than $500 to $300 then $200 then $150 and so on, so more and more people started to buy them for research. They are useless in car repairs because there’s no easy way to use them in other cars. Since you need specialized knowledge to get started, some of those people turned to me and other ‘hackers’ to help them get started. Some units were sent to me to extract data out of them to bootstrap some research too. This is when I became aware of the data leakage happening. I then purchased a unit on eBay to confirm it works exactly like that. And it sure does.”

InsideEVs contacted Tesla in an attempt to determine how the company ensures that customer data is protected when removing ICE computers from vehicles. Tesla did not comment, but one source stated that technicians were told to throw the replaced computers away or damage them before trashing them.

Green commented: “I also heard a prerequisite to throwing the unit into a dumpster is to hit it with a hammer a few times. This obviously does not destroy any data and I did see these units for sale too – at even lower prices, at times as little as $10 if you get a box full of them. Obviously, undamaged units sell for more, so I guess there’s an incentive to not hit them with any hammers.”

['Allum Bokhari'],2020-05-04,"Amazon VP Resigns in Protest over Treatment of Workers, Whistleblowers","Tim Bray, a vice president at Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce giant Amazon, has resigned in protest of the company’s treatment of workers who have criticized the company over inadequate protections against the Chinese virus.

In a blog post, Bray aired his dismay at the tech company’s treatment of employees who spoke out against the company’s handling of the coronavirus.

From Bray’s blog:

Stories surfaced of unrest in Amazon warehouses, workers raising alarms about being uninformed, unprotected, and frightened. Official statements claimed every possible safety precaution was being taken. Then a worker organizing for better safety conditions was fired, and brutally insensitive remarks appeared in leaked executive meeting notes where the focus was on defending Amazon “talking points”. Warehouse workers reached out to AECJ for support. They responded by internally promoting a petition and organizing a video call for Thursday April 16 featuring warehouse workers from around the world, with guest activist Naomi Klein. An announcement sent to internal mailing lists on Friday April 10th was apparently the flashpoint. Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, two visible AECJ leaders, were fired on the spot that day. The justifications were laughable; it was clear to any reasonable observer that they were turfed for whistleblowing. Management could have objected to the event, or demanded that outsiders be excluded, or that leadership be represented, or any number of other things; there was plenty of time. Instead, they just fired the activists. At that point I snapped.

Amazon is currently facing multiple inquiries from labor regulators over allegations that it unlawfully retaliated against employees who complained about the company’s failure to protect them from the virus.

One of the fired Amazon employees, Chris Smalls, spoke exclusively with Breitbart News last week, on a segment of SirusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with Rebecca Mansour.

“At the beginning of March, we were unprotected,” Smalls told Mansour. “We didn’t have any facial masks, we didn’t have any cleaning supplies. We didn’t have the right type of gloves that protect our skin. My associates, my employees that I supervised were falling ill in a domino effect, one by one [with] flu-like symptoms. Some of them were even vomiting at their stations.”

After airing his concerns, Smalls was fired before the end of March.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-04,"Georgia Tech, Boston U. Investigate Cheating During Online Exams","Boston University and Georgia Tech are currently investigating suspected cheating by students in online final exams. The exams, which were recently administrated online, have sparked a conversation in academic about cheating on online exams.

According to a report by the New York Post, administrators at Boston University and Georgia Tech are currently conducting investigations into suspected cheating on recent final exams. As a result of the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic, most final exams are being administered online.

Students in physics and chemistry courses at Boston University may have used an online service called Chegg to look up answers during their final exam. Boston University spokesman Colin Riley said that offending students should have been familiar with how university policies would apply to online examinations.

“The conduct code clearly spells out the university’s expectations and policies, and all aspects of it remain in effect with the shift to remote learning,” Riley said. “The investigation into this particular issue is active and underway.”

Boston University said it is currently conducting an investigation with Chegg to see which students accessed the service during their exam administration. Chegg is an online service where students post answers to various questions that are found in textbooks and test banks. Students typically use the service to aid in their understanding of homework assignments.

A Georgia Tech spokesperson said that they are encouraging students to come forward if they cheated during a recent exam.

“We are aware of the situation and are, of course, disappointed that students were involved with cheating through a digital homework site. At this point, we have offered students a chance to come forward admitting their misconduct on this exam, and we are working to determine if others are involved,” a Georgia Tech spokeswoman said in a comment.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-04,U. of Kentucky Plans to Reopen for Fall Semester,"The University of Kentucky announced on Friday that it plans to reopen the campus for the upcoming fall semester. University President Eli Capilouto said that he and his staff are working to “reinvent” a new “normal” that allows students to safely return to campus in the fall.

According to a local news report, the University of Kentucky is planning to reopen its campus for the fall semester. However, university officials claim that a variety of precautions will be taken to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus.

“In an uncertain world, we must think about new challenges that we’ve never before confronted,” UK President Eli Capilouto wrote in an email to the university community on Friday. “And, we do so as the world seems to shift daily under our feet. You’ve handled every stress and strain with the grace and grit that defines this place.”

According to the email, the University of Kentucky will deploy various precautionary measures to prevent the virus from spreading on campus. For example, some courses may continue to be taught online. Other courses, particularly those that benefit from in-person instruction, will resume on campus.

Capilouto said that his campus reopening plan is structured around three questions. Each question addresses various roadblocks to a successful reopening in the fall.

“What if we have to delay the start of the semester? What does that look like, and how do we shift those dates?”

“What would a hybrid approach look like, in which we are online for part of the semester and in class for another part, if there is a re-emergence of the virus?”

“What if events make a fully online approach to instruction necessary again? How would that transition take place, and what do we do with a campus that is about to begin operations or is already open?”

Brown University President Christina Paxson laid out her proposal to reopen campuses in a New York Times column that was published last week. “Our students will have to understand that until a vaccine is developed, campus life will be different,” Paxson wrote. Paxson suggested that Brown will invite students to return to campus for the fall semester.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/05/04/u-of-kentucky-plans-to-reopen-for-fall-semester/

In a New York Times op-ed titled “The Power of Big Tech Just Keeps Growing,” tech journalist and Recode founder Kara Swisher questions what kind of power Big Tech will have after the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic ends.

Swisher writes in her column: “How about this: The tech giants could have all the power and absolutely none of the accountability — at least all the power that will truly matter.”

Swisher goes on to add that in a previous column she outlined a “problematic trend” that would develop after the pandemic began, writing:

“There will be a culling of most competitors of these giants that will only strengthen the power and reach of the behemoths, eliminating pesky roadblocks to their further domination,” I wrote about tech’s leading companies, who have the money and the means to wait out the storm. “This is obviously not a good thing in the long run. But even if it is good that companies like Amazon and Google and Facebook and Apple have become an essential part of making it easier to shelter in place or to track the virus — thanks a bunch for food delivery, contact-tracing apps and lots of funny memes — there’s much that’s not good. It’s not good that we have set up an epic system of have and have-nots that could become devastating for innovative ideas and start-ups trying to get off the ground. Not good because too much of our data is in the hands of fewer. Not good because these fewer are largely unaccountable to those they serve and hard to control by governments that are elected by the people.

Swisher further adds that following the pandemic, the Masters of the Universe will be even more free to act as they wish with even less government oversight, writing:

But when this crisis is over, I can say that we most certainly should fear Big Tech more because these companies will be freer than ever, with many fewer strictures on them from regulators and politicians. The effort to rein in tech companies had been building decent momentum before coronavirus outbreak, but it will be harder when focus needs to be on building up rather than breaking apart.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-04,Lawsuit: U. of Minnesota Provides Resources Only for Leftist Activists,"Two students at the University of Minnesota are suing their university over its relationship with nine prominent leftist student groups. The students allege in their lawsuit that the university exclusively provides on-campus meeting space for student organizations that engage in progressive activism.

According to a report by the Star Tribune, students Evan Smith and Isaac Smith of the University of Minnesota are suing their school over its alleged preferential treatment towards leftist student groups.

The students claim that the university exclusively provides certain resources to nine student groups that engage in progressive activism. The groups mentioned in the lawsuit are the Black Student Union, La Raza Student Cultural Center, Disabled Student Cultural Center, Feminist Student Activist Collective, Queer Student Cultural Center, Asian-American Student Union, Minnesota International Student Association, American Indian Student Cultural Center, and the Al-Madinah Cultural Center.

The nine groups were granted office space inside the Coffman Memorial Union building on the University of Minnesota’s Twin Cities campus. According to the lawsuit, no other student group is permitted to request similar accommodations. The lawsuit estimates that the lease value of the office space is $30,000 per year.

The lawsuit also questions the constitutionality of a policy that blocks partisan groups from accessing funds that are designated for student organizations. Moreover, the student newspaper and radio station received nearly $1 million in university funding in 2019. However, regular student organizations can only receive up to $55,000 per year.

Attorney Erick Kaardal, who represents the students, argued that the designation of the Coffman Memorial Union building as a meeting space for leftist student groups highlights the university’s bias.

“The University of Minnesota has created a student-services-fee-funded shrine on the second floor of Coffman Memorial Union to worship the great god of political correctness,” Kaardal said. “In order to do so, the university trashes the First Amendment. The public expects the university to take care of and educate its students, not to abuse their student services fees.”

The “Defeat Disinfo” group is being advised by retired Army General Stanley McChrystal.

The project is called “Defeat Disinfo,” a creation of entrepreneur Curtis Hougland. It was initially funded by the Pentagon’s top-secret DARPA research agency, when the goal of the technology was to identify and counter online narratives from Islamic extremists. Founded by technology entrepreneur Curtis Hougland, it is still advised by retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who led U.S. forces in Afghanistan until 2010.

Now Democrats are using the state-funded technology to defeat Trump.

As initially reported by the Washington Post:

A new Democratic-aligned political action committee advised by retired Army Gen.

Police officers, like nurses and other emergency and health workers, have taken to uploading videos of themselves capering around to the youth-oriented social media platforming as the Chinese coronavirus crisis unfolds — but force leaders are concerned such antics detract from the public’s sense that they are serving performing serious and vital functions.

“From a National Police Chiefs Council point of view, we’ve been very clear, particularly through Covid, that we’re not encouraging people to take part in dancing, rapping TikTok challenges,” said Chief Constable Gavin Stephen, the Council’s “national lead for digital engagement”, in comments to the Mail on Sunday.

Chief Constable Andy Cooke of Merseyside Police, which serves a swathe of north-west England including Liverpool, went further, warning that his force had “reminded officers and staff that such behaviour is wholly unprofessional and will not be tolerated… Merseyside Police holds clear policies about behaviour, including the inappropriate use of social media, and anything which breaches these would be subject to potential disciplinary proceedings.”

Chief Constable Cooke added that “Above all else” the role of law enforcement during the Chinese virus crisis is “to support the NHS and keep policing our communities, many of whom would be rightly appalled to see police officers failing to show respect for the uniform they wear.”

Cressida Dick, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police serving much of London, for example, was condemned even by Labour mayor Sadiq Khan for a recent stunt in which she and a large number of other police officers and other piled onto Westminster Bridge, without masks or gloves and without following social distancing rules, in order to perform a mass “Clap for Carers”.

Other senior officers have been criticised for allegedly exceeding their powers by trying to tell shoppers they were not allowed to purchase “non-essential” items — including Easter Eggs — and threatening that officers may begin inspecting their shopping baskets and bags to ensure compliance.

['Penny Starr'],2020-05-03,Tara Reade Facing Online Bullying for Accusing Biden of Sexual Assault,"Tara Reade, the former Senate aide to former Vice President Joe Biden who alleges that the presumptive 2020 Democrat president nominee sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, is facing a barrage of online harassment, according to a Fox News interview with Reade on Saturday.

“I find it astounding — the hypocrisy that Democrats are talking about women being able to tell their story safely,” Reade said. “I’m a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, but yet here I am trying to talk about my history with Joe Biden and I’m just the target of online harassment.”

Fox News reported on the harassment, including fake social media accounts in Reade’s name:

Reade told Fox News that the home address of a family member was plastered online and that person received four “creepy” calls on Friday night, all within 30 minutes, from an unknown number. In two voice messages obtained by Fox News, a caller appeared to have posed as a journalist seeking to speak with Reade. “Hi Ms. Reade, this is Dave Johnson from the Observer, a small New York newspaper,” the voice says before laughing uncontrollably, later saying “Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself” and “Trump 2020.” In the second voice message, which was the third attempt at calling Reade’s family member, the caller says: “Hey Tara, this is Dave Johnson with the Observer and I would really love, I’d really appreciate a call back so we can discuss your new powerful allegation against Vice President Biden. I think you’re setting a tone and underscoring a double standard put forth by the Me Too movement, so I’d really appreciate it if you could just call me back, give me a couple of quick questions.”

Fox News also obtained an email sent to Reade from someone using the name Linda Dubois who called Reade a “f—king whore” and a “disgrace to womanhood” for speaking out against Biden.

“You are a rip-roaring b—h and the great majority of Americans don’t believe you anyhow… I hope you drop dead,” the email said.

Fox News reported that Jon Cooper, a former chair of the Democratic Coalition, questioned if Reade was “unbalanced” or “was driven by malicious motives” on Twitter.

I don’t know if Tara Reade is unbalanced or was driven by malicious motives, but it’s clear that this story is OVER. Now let’s get back to the REAL issues, like Trump’s incompetence that has led to the deaths of nearly 70,000 Americans, with 30 million filing for unemployment. — Jon Cooper 🇺🇸 (@joncoopertweets) May 2, 2020

“This is an example [of] what I am dealing with in addition to the threats and harassment online,” Reade tweeted about Cooper.

“This is something that really has to stop and I’m just wondering where this is coming from,” Reade told Fox News. “Are these just fanatic supporters? And if so, what does that say about our Democratic voters? Why are they targeting me when the party line is supposed to be allowing people to be safe? Why are they targeting my family and myself and making my family frightened?”

“It creates barriers for survivors to want to come forward and talk about difficult things that have happened,” Reade said. “And in my case, talking about how Joe Biden sexually harassed and sexually assaulted me is very excruciating and enough by itself, but then to be targeted and harassed and have my whole family targeted and harassed online by people that call themselves his supporters is not only just upsetting, it’s frightening.”

On Friday, Biden said in an interview with MSNBC that the assault “never happened,” and while women should be heard if they claim they’ve been sexually assaulted they should also be “vetted.”

['James P. Pinkerton'],2020-05-03,"Pinkerton: It’s Time to Build, and Maybe Even Silicon Valley Now Agrees","Cyberspace Is Less Important than “Meatspace”

The coronavirus has reminded all of us—even the tech titans of Silicon Valley—that the digital and the virtual ultimately matter less than the physical and the biological. That is, it’s fun to be online, but what’s more important is to be alive.

Yes, surfing the Internet, sending texts, and streaming movies is of value to ordinary people—even if, of course, vastly greater value is reaped by those who own, say, Google, or Netflix, or AT&T. And yet today, all of us, toilers and tycoons alike, are being reminded that personal health means more than being well wired. Yes, Internet viruses are a pain, but the coronavirus is worse, because a malfunctioning computer isn’t as bad as a malfunctioning human body.

In other words, we’re reminded that for all the importance of cyberspace, our personal space—which techies sometimes call “meatspace”—is of much greater importance.

With that in mind, here in meatspace—also known as reality—we humans have to think about our ourselves, our families, and our fellow citizens. And as corporeal beings, we have to think also about our homes, roads, and jobs.

Indeed, we should think, in particular, about factories—because if the Chinese, for example, wish to infect us with some dangerous pathogen, we need a domestic medical-industrial complex for our own defense. (And of course, if the Chinese were ever to wish to nuke us or conquer us, we need other kinds of hardware, constantly upgraded, for our national security.)

How Silicon Valley Changed

Santa Clara Valley became Silicon Valley in the decades immediately after World War Two. In fact, as early as 1939, pioneering tech entrepreneurs William Hewlett and David Packard started building electronic instruments in their garage; nearby Moffett Naval Air Station became a hub for both purchases and innovation, soon spreading across the entire Department of Defense.

We can step back and observe that this early iteration of Silicon Valley was closely linked to practical applications; that is, the Valley was focused on gadgets and machines that helped us fight our wars.

Yet since the end of the Cold War, Silicon Valley has changed; it has shifted to a new and far more profitable focus, namely, slaking consumer demand. As we all know, Big Tech has focused on the virtual—that is, on new and better ways to search, to send e-mails and texts, to post things online, and to crunch data. To be sure, there’s nothing wrong with finding new ways to communicate, even if, of course, we haven’t adequately forestalled the disruption of other industries, including, but hardly limited to, media and publishing.

Indeed, Silicon Valley, as an ever-charging engine of virtuality, has seemed to be unstoppable. Thus prominent tech venture capitalist Marc Andreessen was inspired to write in 2011, “Software is eating the world.” We can recall that Andreessen first burst into prominence by developing the Mosaic browser for Netscape in the early 1990s; since then, he has invested in such virtual-product companies as Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Twitter, Zynga, and LinkedIn.

As Andreessen put it a decade ago, cheering on his business:

More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services—from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not.

It’s interesting to recall that one of few voices running counter to Andreessen was that of another tech mogul, Peter Thiel, who declared in 2011, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” (Thiel was referring, of course, to the limits imposed by Twitter on the number of characters in a tweet; the limit has since been increased to 280.)

Thiel’s deeper point was that if Andreessen’s software-centric view prevailed, then progress in the world of hardware would likely continue to falter—and that’s why we can send tweets but not go flying around in Jetsons-type vehicles.

Indeed, an over-emphasis on the digital realm has come at the expense of the physical environment—which techies often call the analog world. After all, if you can work from home, then why worry about physical infrastructure, such as roads and bridges? And if you could freely surf the World Wide Web from your couch, why worry about national borders and a country’s sovereignty? And if you don’t worry about borders and countries, then why worry about your countrymen?

In the advanced tech lingo of the digital elite, geographic demarcations are simply “errors,” to be worked around by clever programmers and hackers—and the nation state is therefore said to be obsolete.

The Paradox of Slow Growth in the Digital Era

This idea of rampant digitalization has had consequences, to be sure—severe consequences. An important article appearing in The Atlantic in January was headlined, “The Real Trouble With Silicon Valley: The toxicity of the web is peanuts compared with Big Tech’s failure to remake the physical world.” As author Derek Thompson put it:

The digital age has coincided with a slump in America’s economic dynamism. The tech sector’s innovations have made a handful of people quite rich, but it has failed to create enough middle-class jobs to offset the decline of the country’s manufacturing base, or to help solve the country’s most pressing problems.

Continuing in that vein, Thompson added:

Decades from now, historians will likely look back on the beginning of the 21st century as a period when the smartest minds in the world’s richest country sank their talent, time, and capital into a narrow band of human endeavor—digital technology. Their efforts have given us frictionless access to media, information, consumer goods, and chauffeurs. But software has hardly remade the physical world. We were promised an industrial revolution. What we got was a revolution in consumer convenience.

That is, we have a lot of gig companies, such as Uber, Instacart, and Doordash, which is nice—even if, paradoxically, they rely mostly on old-fashioned people. And sadly, in the new order created by Silicon Valley, the algorithms have not enriched many workers, but have, rather, impoverished them. The machines, having broken down old industries, now assign displaced workers to drudge tasks, paying them only paltry sums—as insecure contractors, not as secure employees.

Not surprisingly, this bifurcating society—plutocrats and peons—is not a strong society, because what’s missing is a robust middle class that anchors institutions in comfortable stability.

Nor, interestingly enough, does this bifurcation lead to a strong economy, because the gains from productivity growth are mostly captured by the one percent of entrepreneurs and investors. Such top-heaviness, of course, leads to over-financialization and under-consumption.

In fact, Thompson points out that economic growth in the digital era has actually been slower—80 percent slower—than it was in the pre-digital era. He cites Chad Syverson, an economist at the University of Chicago, who has found that the slowdown in the economy, just since 2004, has cost the U.S. $2.7 trillion.

No wonder Peter Thiel, that tech renegade who has always cared about the physical United States, and its citizens, endorsed Donald Trump in 2016.

In the meantime, today we find that our “American” defense contractors are dependent on Mexico for key parts of their supply chains. In the tech-idealized borderless world, this is fine. In the real world, it’s not fine.

As George Mason University economist Alex Tabarrok wrote on April 26, this decline in our domestic productive capacity is “killing us.” As he put it, “The failure to spend on actually fighting the virus with science is mind boggling.”

It is, Tabarrok continued, “A rot … a failure of imagination and boldness which is an embarrassment to the country that put a man on the moon.” He noted, for example, that the share of the federal budget going to research and development has fallen from 12 percent in the 1960s to three percent today. “We are great at spending on welfare and warfare,” he concluded, “but all that spending has crowded out spending on innovation and now that is killing us.”

Let’s pray that it’s not too late to save ourselves, and our country. And then let’s get to work.

A Convert in Silicon Valley

This year, almost a decade after he celebrated the triumph of software, Silicon Valley’s Andreessen has chosen to celebrate hardware, actual construction, and an overall commitment to remaking our physical environment. Perhaps the onslaught of the virus has convinced Andreessen that more tweets won’t save us. In an April 18 essay, “It’s Time to Build,” he argued:

Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it’s not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it.

Andreessen further attacked “smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build,” adding, “You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.” Warming to his theme, he continued:

You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know—and we’re experiencing right now!—the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods.

Andreessen added, where are the “giant, gleaming, state-of-the-art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost—all throughout our country?”

He had still more questions: “Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?” That reference to “flying cars,” of course, was a backhanded admission that Peter Thiel had the right idea a decade ago, because, yes, flying cars—and the technology that goes into them— are more important than tweets.

It’s certainly heartening to have Andreessen on the side of human beings and their needs; now we’ll have to wait and see how he, and his fellow tech titans, choose to follow up. Indeed, we might even hope that the digital transformation of the last few decades has just been a warm-up for the coming physical transformation over the next few decades.

In fact, there are some promising indicators, suggesting that progress in the digital space will translate into progress in the medical space. For instance, an intriguing article appeared in the Wall Street Journal on April 27, headlined, “The Secret Group of Scientists and Billionaires Pushing a Manhattan Project for Covid-19.” (We can recall, of course, that during World War Two, the Manhattan Project developed the atomic bomb; it’s hard to think of anything more physical than that.) This new group hopes, for example, to transform the Food and Drug Administration, so that it can move with Moore’s Law speed.

In fact, World War Two saw a Pentagon-sponsored surge in many technologies beyond nuclear, providing our fighting men with radar, penicillin, synthetic rubber, and even new kinds of fabrics, designed to be used for everything from uniforms to parachutes. Indeed, it’s fair to say that the Good War was won as much on the homefront—in our laboratories and factories—as it was on the battlefront.

And of course, after the war, these technologies were spun off into the civilian sector. Thus we can see the origins of the big economic boom of the three decades after the war—you know, the boom that’s ebbed in recent decades.

Amidst the Current Carnage, Signs of Real Hope and Change

As our great wartime president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, said famously at the beginning of his time in the White House, “The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.”

So now today, as we confront the reality that we’re in another war—a war against the virus—we should take heart in the fact that we have plenty of resolve and resources. And if we do take heart, we can overcome fear.

Indeed, if we buckle down and apply what we know—and figure out what we must learn—we can win this war and come back even stronger. We can, in fact, Make America Great Again. Much of that greatness, of course, will come from our own ingenuity and knowhow; indeed, it might have nothing to do, at least at first, with Silicon Valley, and everything to do with the Heartland.

For instance, just on April 30 came a report from Marcellus Drilling News, a publication devoted to the shale-gas industry in the Northeast, taking note of an astonishing new breakthrough in carbon-based fuels.

Researchers at Penn State University’s EMS Energy Institute, joined by H Quest, a Pittsburgh-based start-up, have found a way to “burn” natural gas, generating usable hydrogen while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions to zero. As the article explains, this joint partnership:

… may hold the answer to reducing so-called greenhouse gas emissions while also paving the way to disrupt the chemical and material industries. The collaboration has resulted in several research projects that aim to “reinvent” both coal and natural gas as clean, cost-effective sources of fuels and high-performance materials. … Penn State and a company called H Quest are extracting hydrogen from nat gas using microwave plasma technology. It’s completely free of so-called greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, microwave plasma enables smaller, modular chemical conversion plants-cheaper to build and deploy.

The prospect here is epic: We can preserve our carbon-based fuel industry, as well as the many millions of jobs it creates and supports, and still have an environment that might put a smile on the face of that pouting teen, Greta Thunberg. (Okay, probably not—some greens dislike everything.)

In fact, if this new technique can cleanly distill hydrogen not only from natural gas, but also from oil and coal, then we could have all the domestic energy we need for hundreds, even thousands, of years. And that would surely be the beginning of a long-term economic boom for places that need, and deserve, better times.

So maybe here is a project in which Marc Andreessen can invest, bringing the significant value-add of the latest digital tech to this new energy tech.

If so, that’s how we get the money to start building up the country again. And that’s how we start reuniting our people, aligning the red of carbon country with the blue of silicon country.

Together. That’s how we go about saving our nation—in this time of grave peril.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/05/03/pinkerton-its-time-to-build-and-maybe-even-silicon-valley-now-agrees/
['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-03,Harvard Donating Epstein Cash to Sex Crime Victim Groups,"Harvard University announced on Friday that it has donated the remaining funds that Jeffrey Epstein gifted to the university to charities that aid sex crime victims. Harvard has been criticized for its extensive relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex criminal, who reportedly visited the campus more than 40 times following his release from jail in 2010.

According to a report by CNBC, Harvard University is finally making efforts to distance itself from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who mysteriously died in a Manhattan prison last fall. The university released a 27-page report on Friday detailing the university’s extensive relationship with Epstein.

The university will donate approximately $200,000, the remaining funds from Epstein’s donations, to various groups that help victims of sex crimes. “These organizations support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault, and Harvard is proud to support their important and valuable work,” Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow wrote in a statement.

Epstein donated $9.1 million to the university between 1998 and 2008. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of procuring an underage girl for prostitution. Following the conviction, Harvard blocked Epstein from making further donations to the university. However, Harvard professors continued to solicit private donations from Epstein when he was released from jail in 2010. Moreover, the report claims that some professors lobbied the university to resume their acceptance of donations from Epstein in 2013.

The Harvard report notes that several professors admitted to visiting Epstein at his various homes, including on his infamous island. Some even admitted to visiting him while he was in prison.

“A number of the Harvard faculty members we interviewed also acknowledged that they visited Epstein at his homes in New York, Florida, New Mexico or the Virgin Islands, visited him in jail or on work release, or traveled on one of his planes,” the report reads.

Breitbart News reported on Saturday that Epstein maintained a private office on Harvard campus which he received after making a $6.5 million donation in 2003. Epstein reportedly visited Harvard’s campus more than 40 times after being released from prison in 2010.

Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre is said to be working flat out to fend off the attacks, which they have condemned as “utterly reprehensible”.

“We have seen an increased proportion of cyber attacks related to coronavirus and our experts work around-the-clock to help organisations targeted,” the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) subsidiary confirmed in a statement quoted in the Mail on Sunday.

“It looks like they’re trying to steal or borrow information about our response to coronavirus,” a source told the newspaper.

“This problem – intellectual property theft and a blurred line between state and serious crime – has been around for a while but there’s obviously now an increased need to ensure we protect UK PLC and its assets,” another source added.

The Mail cited the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation as countries the cyber-attacks had been traced to — but, curiously, made no mention of China, whose communist regime has a particular interest in the pandemic and a reputation for aggressive theft of private information and intellectual property.

Tobias Ellwood MP, a former Defence minister and current chairman of the Defence Committee of the House of Commons, has struck a similarly combative tone, warning that the “global distraction of Covid-19 provides the perfect fog of war to conduct cyber attacks” — and that Britain should “not hesitate in retaliating”.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-02,Turley: Democrats Want China’s Restrictions on Free Speech,"Jonathan Turley, a liberal constitutional scholar at George Washington University, wrote Saturday that some Democrats were using the coronavirus pandemic to demand China-style restrictions on free speech.

In the op-ed, published in The Hill, Turley criticized “the politicians and academics who have called for the censorship of social media and the internet,” including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Hillary Clinton, and others:

The only thing spreading faster than the coronavirus has been censorship and the loud calls for greater restrictions on free speech. The Atlantic published an article last week by Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith and University of Arizona law professor Andrew Keane Woods calling for Chinese style censorship of the internet. They declared that “in the great debate of the past two decades about freedom versus control of the network, China was largely right and the United States was largely wrong” and “significant monitoring and speech control are inevitable components of a mature and flourishing internet, and governments must play a large role in these practices to ensure that the internet is compatible with society norms and values.” The justification for that is the danger of “fake news” about coronavirus risks and cures. Yet this is only the latest rationalization for rolling back free speech rights. For years, Democratic leaders in Congress called for censorship of “fake news” on social media sites. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have all engaged in increasing levels of censorship and have a well known reputation for targeting conservative speech. … Citizens now will have to decide, as Goldsmith and Woods insist, if “China was right.” For my part, I remain hopeless in my desire for old fashioned free speech before the pandemic. You see, this “new normal” seems a lot like the old normal that the Framers changed with the First Amendment. China may be right for many in Congress and academia, but it remains on the wrong side of history. Not even a pandemic will change that.

Turley, who does not support President Donald Trump, nevertheless testified in Trump’s defense before the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment inquiry, warning Congress it was abusing its power.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-02,Twitter Suspends Candace Owens for Telling Michigan to ‘Go to Work’,"Conservative firebrand and BLEXIT founder Candace Owens was suspended from Twitter on Saturday after tweeting that people in Michigan should open their businesses and “go to work” despite the draconian measures implemented by Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) in response to the Chinese virus.

“Apparently [Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer] believes she is a duly elected dictator of a socialist country,” Owens had tweeted. “The people of Michigan need to stand up to her. Open your businesses. Go to work.”

“The police think she’s crazy too,” she added. “They are not going to arrest 10,000,000 people for going to work.”

On Saturday, Owens received a notification from Twitter informing her that her account was suspended over the aforementioned tweet.

“We determined this Tweet violated the Twitter Rules, specifically for:” read the notification, but did not further clarify which specific rules Owens had violated on the social media platform.

Lockdown measures established roughly one month ago in response to the Wuhan coronavirus have already upended businesses across the country, and have plunged millions of Americans into unemployment and financial devastation.

Owens told Breitbart News that her options were to either go through a series of admitting that her tweet was in violation of the platform’s Terms of Service [TOS], or appeal her suspension. Owens has chosen to appeal the suspension.

“I refuse to admit to a violation, because none were committed,” Owens told Breitbart News. “Hence the reason they did not list a rule that was violated.”

“I unequivocally stand by every single word of my tweet,” Owens continued. “If Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez can use Twitter’s platform to encourage workers to walk out and boycott — I should be allowed to encourage lawful citizens to resume work.”

“The only person breaking any laws is Governor turned Dictator Gretchen Whitmer who is impoverishing millions, ignoring the votes of her state legislature, and as a result, rolling over the constitutionally protected rights of Michigan citizens,” she added.

“Twitter was unable or unwilling to provide me with any specific rule that I violated, which is why I have appealed their decision,” said Owens. “While I am not an expert on twitter TOS, I cannot see how suggesting people ought to work would be a violation of anything other than socialist reverie.”

Twitter did not immediately respond to Breitbart News’ request for comment.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-02,Report: Harvard Gave Jeffrey Epstein His Own Office on Campus,"A new report published this week details the extensive ties between Harvard University and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who mysteriously died in a Manhattan prison last fall. Harvard reportedly gave Epstein his own office on campus in exchange for almost $10 million in donations he gifted to the university between 1998 and 2007.

According to a report by the Boston Globe, Harvard University gave Jeffrey Epstein an office on campus that he continued to visit after he was convicted of underage sex crimes in 2008. In fact, Epstein reportedly visited the campus more than 40 times after been released from jail in 2010. The office was reportedly equipped with Epstein’s personal keepsakes and a dedicated Harvard phone line.

Breitbart News reported in September 2019 that Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow said that the Ivy League institution feels “regret” accepting nearly $10 million in gifts from Jeffrey Epstein. The university blocked Epstein from donating in 2008 when Epstein was convicted on child sex charges.

However, individual professors at Harvard continued to solicit private donations from Epstein after 2008. Martin Nowak, Director of Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, used a $6.5 million donation from Epstein in 2003 to establish the program. Nowak reportedly rewarded Epstein with private office space on campus for his donation.

The controversy surrounding Epstein forced Bacow to address these private gifts in a letter to the Harvard community. “The report issued today describes principled decision-making but also reveals institutional and individual shortcomings that must be addressed — not only for the sake of the University but also in recognition of the courageous individuals who sought to bring Epstein to justice,” Bacow wrote.

Harvard announced on Friday that Nowak has been placed on paid administrative leave for a potential violation of the university’s grant funding policies.

Claudine Gay, Harvard’s dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, argued that faculty at elite universities should be held to a high moral standard. “We are reminded on a near daily basis what a privilege it is to be a member of this academic community,” Gay wrote. “With that privilege comes a responsibility to hold one another accountable and to make sure, as an institution, we align our practices with the highest ethical standards.”

Breitbart News reported in September 2019 that the Director of MIT’s Media Lab was forced to step down over his ties to Epstein. The decision came after the New Yorker published a report revealing Epstein’s extensive financial ties to the MIT program.

['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-05-04,Sharansky to Use Israel's Genesis Prize Proceeds to Fight Coronavirus,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, winner of the 2020 Genesis Prize, announced Monday that he will donate the $1 million award to organizations fighting the coronavirus pandemic and assisting people most affected by the outbreak.

In a statement released by prize organizers, Sharansky said he would support organizations in Israel and abroad, some delivering immediate relief to victims and others pursuing longer-term research against the disease. In forgoing the prize money, he follows a tradition set by previous winners.

“Many people of good will around the world have given generously to help organizations and individuals who have been devastated by COVID-19. I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to this humanitarian effort,” Sharansky said.

The Genesis Prize Foundation said donations would go to organizations providing emergency services to Jerusalem residents of all faiths, and assisting severely disabled children, domestic violence victims, African migrants in Tel Aviv and people in need of mental health services.

He will also support research at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science, Columbia University and New York University, and help elderly Jewish communities overseas.

The $1 million award is granted each year to a person recognized for outstanding professional achievement, contribution to humanity and commitment to Jewish values.

Sharansky rose to prominence in the 1970s as a dissident in the Soviet Union, where he worked closely with the human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andre Sakharov. He was a founding member of the Helsinki Group, which monitored rights abuses by the Soviets, and became one of the best-known “refuseniks,” Soviet Jews who were denied permission to emigrate to Israel.

In 1977, Sharansky was imprisoned on fabricated charges of spying for the United States. He spent nine years in prison, serving much of that time in solitary confinement.

Sharansky was freed in a prisoner swap in 1986 after an intense international campaign led by his wife, Avital, and immediately moved to Israel.

The following year, he led a demonstration in Washington where, on the eve of a visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, some 250,000 Jews called for an end to persecution of Soviet Jews and for the freedom for them to emigrate. Gorbachev subsequently opened the country’s borders, clearing the way for an estimated 1.6 million Jews to emigrate.

In Israel, Sharansky has spent a lengthy career in politics and public service. He also has authored three books and received a number of prestigious recognitions, including Israel’s highest award, the Israel Prize, as well as the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and Congressional Gold Medal.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/04/sharansky-to-use-israels-genesis-prize-proceeds-to-fight-chinese-coronavirus/
['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-05-04,Lebanon Appeals to I.M.F. for Bailout as Economy Collapses,"Beirut (AFP) — Protest-hit Lebanon has approved an economic rescue plan and requested aid from the International Monetary Fund as it battles its worst financial crisis in decades.

But how did Lebanon become one of the most indebted countries in the world? What’s the plan out of this quagmire, and how likely is it to work?

– How did we get here? –

After the 1975-1990 civil war, Lebanon set about rebuilding, launching itself on a path of endless borrowing and ballooning debt.

Successive governments focused on developing an economy built around services and tourism, and fuelled by foreign investment, all dependent on stability.

But they neglected structural reforms, as a political class deeply divided along sectarian lines allowed cronyism and graft.

“The economic crisis is, at its core, a governance crisis emanating from a dysfunctional sectarian system that hindered rational policymaking and permitted a culture of corruption and waste,” experts wrote in a January report published by Carnegie Middle East.

Over the years, Lebanon was also rocked by a wave of assassinations, the 2006 war with Israel and then a series of attacks after war broke out in Syria in 2011.

Repeated political deadlocks stalled decision-making, with lawmakers on one occasion failing to elect a new president for more than two years.

The debt grew as spending increased, including to subsidise a loss-making electricity sector dependent on fuel imports and to pay high interest rates on the loans themselves.

The balance of payments deficit also deepened as growth slowed, while an oversized banking sector offered huge interests on deposits.

By late 2019, Lebanon had racked up a debt equivalent to 170 percent of its GDP.

The pound has plummeted from 1,507 to more than 4,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar on the parallel market in recent weeks, and inflation has soared.

Banks imposed crippling capital controls in the autumn, while deteriorating living conditions sparked mass cross-sectarian protests.

– What’s the plan? –

An economic reform plan the cabinet approved on April 30 aims to unlock foreign aid, restructure the debt, and cut back on spending including in the electricity sector.

Lebanon aims to drum up $10 billion in financial support, on top of $11 billion in grants and loans pledged by international donors in 2018.

But the five-year austerity plan includes measures likely to be unpopular such as a freeze on recruitment in the public sector.

It has also been calculated according to an exchange rate of 3,500 pounds to the dollar.

Nasser Yassin, associate professor of policy and planning at the American University in Beirut, said the plan was a good “diagnosis” of the situation but not complete.

“It’s an attempt to solve this thorny crisis through financial and accounting tools to obtain foreign aid through the IMF, yet it imposes harsh conditions when it comes to social benefits and austerity measures,” he said.

“The poorest levels of society and the middle class are the ones who will pay the price, with high inflation and the contraction of the economy expected.”

Up to 45 percent of Lebanon’s population already lives in poverty, official estimates show.

– Will it work? –

Yassin said such a plan to “redesign the state’s financial management” could have benefitted from more consultations on how to break away from the old model of a free-market economy to attract foreign capital.

Its implementation is expected to run up against the interests of political parties in the public sector, he added.

Mohammad Faour, a research fellow in banking and finance at University College Dublin, agreed much depended on “how cooperative the political class will be in enacting them in parliament”.

“There’s always this worry that political bickering will get in the way,” he said.

MPs will need to approve many parts of the plan, including accepting foreign aid, restructuring the debt, and imposing new taxes.

President Michel Aoun has invited the leaders of all parliamentary blocs to discuss the plan Wednesday.

The government, formed in January after protests ousted its predecessor, does not enjoy huge popular support.

But it is backed by key political forces including Shiite movement Hezbollah, which has seats in parliament despite the United States — and now Germany — labelling it as “terrorist”.

“It will be a hard slog, but Lebanon can get back on its feet with a solid reform plan that is front-loaded with international support,” Faour said.

“But the main concern is whether internal politics will permit the implementation of a credible plan.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/04/lebanon-appeals-to-i-m-f-for-bailout-as-economy-collapses/
['Deborah Danan'],2020-05-03,High Court Weighs Whether to Allow Indicted Netanyahu to Be PM,"TEL AVIV – Israel’s High Court of Justice on Sunday held the first hearing, which was broadcast live on television, about whether to allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form the next government despite his indictment in three corruption cases.

The hearing, which is set to continue on Monday and Tuesday, also covered whether certain aspects of the rotational unity government deal struck between the Likud and Blue and White parties are constitutional.

The deal’s validity was challenged in eight separate petitions, with the main argument being members of Knesset indicted on corruption charges cannot serve as prime minister.

According to the terms of the deal, Netanyahu will serve as prime minister for a year and a half after which Blue and White head Benny Gantz will replace him.

According to Anar Herman, who represented Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit at the hearing, Netanyahu “in the current situation is not disqualified from serving as prime minister.”

An attorney for Netanyahu’s Likud party averred that the entire process of selecting a prime minister “is a constitutional process, not an administrative one.

“It’s inappropriate for the court to intervene in the constitutional judgment of the people and the members of Knesset,” the attorney said in remarks translated by The Times of Israel.

Michael Ravilo, representing Netanyahu, said it would have been preferable for the court to have thrown out the petitions immediately rather than involving itself “in these political issues.”

Attorney Avital Sompolinsky, representing the Knesset’s legal department, said the “decision is so political and complex, touching on the relationship between the Knesset and the government,” and the court should “adopt the view that it can enter this sensitive and deeply politicized arena only in the most extreme cases.”

Indeed, it seemed that as the day’s hearing drew to a close the 11-panel bench moved towards not barring Netanyahu from setting up a government.

At one stage, Chief Justice Esther Hayut seemed to lose her temper as she demanded the petitioners provide a basis for their demand.

“Show us something! A law! A verdict! From this country’s [history]! From [somewhere else] in the world! Something!,” Hayut said according to the Times of Israel. “After all, [you’re asking us to set] a global precedent! You want us to rule without a basis simply according to your personal opinion?”

Suzie Navot, a constitutional law expert, told Channel 12 the sense was the justices were saying it was up to the Knesset, and not the High Court, to legislate.

She said it would be difficult to imagine a scenario whereby the court would determine that contravening the public’s faith in governing authorities was justified.

Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said if the court rules Netanyahu cannot serve, it would amount to “an unprecedented attack on Israeli democracy.”

The coalition deal is “a necessity, the result of three election campaigns and a desire among Israelis to avoid a fourth election,” he said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/03/high-court-weighs-whether-to-allow-indicted-netanyahu-to-be-pm/
['Simon Kent'],2020-05-03,Iran Rush to Reopen Mosques as Coronavirus Lockdown Eases: Rouhani,"Iran President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday mosques would reopen across one third of the country within 24-hours, after they were shuttered early in March as the Middle East’s deadliest Chinese coronavirus outbreak took hold.

Rouhani said 132 counties would “reopen their mosques as of tomorrow,” the semi–official Tasnim news agency reported.

“Social distancing is more important than collective prayer,” Rouhani added, arguing Islam considers safety obligatory, while praying in mosques is only “recommended”.

The targeted counties are “low-risk”, Rouhani said in a televised meeting of the country’s virus taskforce.

The ministry said the trajectory of infections has started a “gradual” downward trend in Iran, where the death toll is 6,156 and total number of diagnosed cases has reached 96,448.

The Islamic republic has tried to contain the spread of the virus by denying public entry to universities, cinemas, stadiums and other public spaces since March as the full scale of the crisis gradually emerged.

But it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy since April 11, arguing the sanctions-hit country cannot afford to remain closed for business.

Only “high-risk” businesses like gyms and barbershops remain closed, with Rouhani adding “We will continue the reopenings calmly and gradually.”

Iran’s mosques will hope to avoid the dramatic scenes sometimes evident at the start of the epidemic where some Muslim faithful demanded the right to continue worshipping practices at holy shrines that included kissing, touching and in some cases licking sacred public objects.

When state TV initially announced the shrines’ closure, mass protests followed.

“We are here to say that Tehran is damn wrong to do that!” one Shiite cleric shouted at the shrine in Mashhad, according to an online video. Others joined him in chanting: “The health minister is damn wrong to do that, the president is damn wrong to do that!”

As Breitbart News reported, strict Muslim religious observance is often at odds with state control in Iran.

Earlier in March online videos emerged showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they had no fear of coronavirus infection.

['Chris Tomlinson'],2020-05-03,Italian Jews Angered By 'Work Sets You Free' Poster for May Day,"Members of the Italian Jewish community expressed anger after the Naples city government created a poster to celebrate May Day containing the same phrase used on the gates of the Auschwitz death camp.

The phrase “solo il lavoro rende liberi” or “only work makes you free” was seen on the posters created by the Naples Department of Social and Work Policies — nearly identical to the Auschwitz gate’s infamous “Arbeit Macht Frei” or “work sets you free” slogan.

The Naples Jewish community reacted immediately to the posters, saying: “We consider the episode a dangerous example of how direct knowledge of what has happened has less and less consideration in certain administrations, evidently more accustomed to the trivialization of historical events than to the correct perception of their correct meaning.”

Monica Buonanno, the Councilor for Social Policies and Labor for the Municipality of Naples, quickly changed the posters to the phrase “only work creates dignity” and claimed that the stress of the coronavirus outbreak had led to the misstep.

Lydia Schapirer, president of the Naples Jewish community, said that “such casual use of words, reveals unacceptable superficiality, insensitivity and ignorance on the part of an institution.”

Many leftist politicians, trade unions and other groups were forced to engage in May Day celebrations online rather than in person due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The data has also been used as an excuse for violence by militant far-left Antifa extremists in cities like Paris and Berlin, with the latter seeing some violence this year when a team of journalists from broadcaster ZDF were attacked by a group of around 15 people.

Four members of the television crew were rushed to the hospital due to their injuries, with two seriously injured. Police arrested five men and a woman in connection with the incident, with all believed to be far-left extremists.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-01,Dissidents: Coronavirus Disaster Prompts Protest Wave in Iran,"According to Iranian resistance groups, a new mass protest movement is gaining steam in every corner of Iran, with people hitting the streets to protest the regime’s poor economic policies and hideous bungling of the coronavirus crisis.

The opposition PMOI/MEK reported stonemasons and the owners of fruit stores holding a rally on Wednesday to protest “poor economic conditions that have become unbearable for the general public.”

On the same day, employees of a provincial electric company in northeastern Iran reportedly held a rally to protest being required to work without adequate protection against the Wuhan coronavirus. Protesters said officials ignored their requests for gloves, masks, and disinfectant.

Tuesday reportedly saw protests from villagers in the Kurdistan region, including employees of the Sarigoni gold mine, who were angered that mine officials have replaced them with workers from other areas who are willing to accept lower wages, and employees of a water company in southwestern Iran who said their wages and pensions have been withheld. Dozens of workers allegedly went on strike in northwestern Iran for similar reasons, defying coronavirus-related orders to remain indoors so they could march in the streets.

Municipal workers across the country have protested slow payment of their wages, poor benefits, and ham-fisted attempts by the regime to suppress their protests instead of addressing their concerns.

“We have not been paid or received our pensions since February. Some workers have been summoned by authorities and we have been accused of provoking other workers to hold gatherings and protest rallies. They constantly resort to crackdown measures instead of paying our salaries and answering our questions,” one protester is quoted as saying.

“They’re demanding fees for internet service in our kids’ schools, their supplies, etc. The monthly rent for the store, the mortgage, both have risen, and all the while we are experiencing a bear market and we have no income. What else should I tell you? There’s not a single official willing to listen to these troubles. Name me one official who understands the people’s pains. They said they won’t return any checks, but they did. They said we won’t be demanding lease payments, but again they did. They said the price of bread won’t rise, but it did. They said food prices won’t rise, but it did. Show me one official who comes and listens to the people’s problems, and actually takes some action,” complained another.

In the coastal regions of southern Iran, PMOI claimed that fishermen protested shortages of fuel for the boats and price-gouging for gasoline, while farmers rallied to demand promised compensation for recent floods, and residents of the city of Rasht complained their deposits have been frozen by local banks.

Iranian state media has acknowledged the growing number of protests and expressed fears they could coalesce into a national movement with the potential for violence – or, to put it more cynically, a national movement threatening enough for the regime to use violence to suppress it.

“This time the protests will be more intense and violent,” one state-run daily warned last week. “It can be described as a super-movement protest in the country that will be attended by most of the lower and middle classes.”

Some Iranian state papers are predicting total economic collapse as a consequence of the coronavirus, while media more closely aligned with President Hassan Rouhani and his faction of the Iranian government are running optimistic editorials about Iranians setting aside their differences and coming together to recover from the pandemic.

Some of those editorials judiciously admitted the regime might have to address the obvious inequality between comfortable, highly-paid officials and impoverished citizens in order to defuse public anger.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/01/dissidents-coronavirus-disaster-prompts-protest-wave-in-iran/
['Simon Kent'],2020-05-01,Iran Warns Germany of 'Consequences' for Banning Hezbollah Terrorists,"Germany’s total ban on Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist organization drew a swift response Friday from Iran, with the Islamic republic saying “consequences” would follow.

As Breitbart News reported, Hezbollah was labeled a “Shiite terrorist organisation” with dozens of police and special forces storming mosques and associations across Germany linked to the terror group.

German political support followed swiftly.

Hezbollah activities “violate criminal law and the organization opposes the concept of international understanding,” German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in announcing the move.

“Hezbollah denies Israel’s right to exist, threatens violence and terror and continues to massively upgrade its rocket arsenal,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Twitter. “We in Germany must exhaust the means of the rule of law to take action against the criminal and terrorist activities of Hezbollah.”

The German crackdown on Hezbollah means its flags are banned at all demonstrations and meetings across the country. Berlin’s municipal government already bans Hezbollah symbols and flags at demonstrations.

Germany, like most of Europe, has until now dragged its feet in outlawing both the military and political arms of the Lebanon-based group to protect relations with Beirut and Tehran.

The U.S., UK, Netherlands and Israel designates the anti-Israel group in its entirety a terror organization.

Iran’s foreign ministry rejected the ban by saying it ignores “realities in West Asia,” according to the Tehran Times.

It “strongly” condemned the decision it said showed “complete disrespect to the government and nation of Lebanon, as Hezbollah is a formal and legitimate part of the country’s government and parliament.”

Iran said Hezbollah had a “key role in fighting Daesh’s terrorism in the region,” using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.

“The German government must face the negative consequences of its decision in the fight against real terrorist groups in the region,” it added.

Iran has long been a major supporter of the group and its terror attacks on Israel.

Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Berlin and the acting U.S. director of national intelligence, urged all European Union countries to follow Germany and outlaw Hezbollah’s activities.

The organization “cannot be allowed to use Europe as a safe haven to support terrorism in Syria and across the Middle East,” he said.

“The world is a little bit safer with this German government ban of Hezbollah. The entire U.S. embassy in Berlin has worked with the German government and the Bundestag for two years to push for this ban. It’s an incredible diplomatic success that we hope will motivate many officials in Brussels to follow suit with an EU-wide ban,” Grenell told FoxNew.com in an interview.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/01/iran-warns-germany-of-consequences-for-total-ban-on-hezbollah/
['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-30,Germany Finally Outlaws Hezbollah Terror Group,"TEL AVIV – Germany on Thursday announced it officially recognizes all of Hezbollah, and not just its military wing, as a terrorist organization, marking a departure from its previous position which was in line with the EU.

Hezbollah activities “violate criminal law and the organization opposes the concept of international understanding,” German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in a statement.

Germany, like most of Europe, has until now dragged its feet in outlawing both the military and political arms of the Lebanon-based group out of concerns this would harm relations with Beirut.

The U.S., UK, Netherlands and Israel designates the group in its entirety a terror organization.

“Just as it is not possible to distinguish between political and religious members of the organization, it is also not possible to divide the organization into its political, social and military wings,” a 32-page long document from the Germany’s Interior Ministry states.

German police on Thursday morning raided mosques and residences associated with Hezbollah in various locations across the country after the ban was announced.

Even though there is no official branch of Hezbollah in Germany, security officials believe up to 1,050 people are affiliated with the group and the country has been used as both a recruiting and fundraising base, Reuters reported.

Hezbollah symbols may not be used publicly in any assembly, print, audio or visual material in Germany, and its assets will be confiscated “to the benefit of the Federal Republic of Germany,” the Interior Ministry’s statement reads.

“Violations of bans on organizations and activities are equally punishable,” the statement continues.

Hezbollah “openly calls for the violent elimination of the State of Israel and questions the right of the State of Israel to exist. The organization is therefore fundamentally against the concept of international understanding, regardless of whether it presents itself as a political, social or military structure.”

German security authorities can “use all available instruments of the rule of law to crack down on terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and take strict measures against their activities in Germany,” the statement adds.

“The organization is therefore fundamentally against the concept of international understanding, regardless of whether it presents itself as a political, social or military structure,” the German Interior Ministry said.

“Its violent denial of the right to exist of the state of Israel also fundamentally opposes Germany’s national ethos,” a separate Interior Ministry document states.

Foreign Minister Israel Katz lauded the decision as “very important and values-based.

Banning Hezbollah is “significant in the world battle against terror,” Katz added. “I want to express my appreciation to the German government for this step and am certain many governments in the Middle East and victims of Hezbollah’s terrorism share my gratitude.”

Katz called on the EU and other European states to follow suit and declare that “Hezbollah, its military and political arms, is a terrorist organization and must be treated that way.”

The American Jewish Committee also welcomed the move.

“This is a welcome, much-anticipated, and significant German decision,” AJC head David Harris said. “We now hope other European nations will take a close look at Germany’s decision and reach the same conclusion about the true nature of Hezbollah.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/04/30/germany-outlaws-hezbollah-terror-group-raids-mosques/

Hezbollah has been engaged in a propaganda campaign against the Chinese coronavirus throughout Lebanon, a response, in part, to outrage from the Lebanese people over its outsized influence on the country’s government and rumors that Hezbollah’s ties to the Islamic regime in Iran resulted in the country’s domestic outbreak. Iran is experiencing one of the most destructive Chinese coronavirus epidemics in the world; dissident groups estimate that nearly 40,000 people have died there.

Hezbollah claims to be working alongside Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), also a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, in combating the virus.

“I earn $600, but I used to receive at least double that amount in dental care, gas subsidies, food supplies, and many others. A lot of the financial support we used to get has now been slashed,” a man named Abou Hadi, who al-Arabiya identified as a Hezbollah “fighter,” told the news agency. Hadi claimed to have fought in the Syrian Civil War – Shiite groups support dictator Bashar al-Assad – and suffered multiple injuries that require medical attention. Hezbollah promised to support him if he engaged in jihad on their behalf, but that support is allegedly dwindling.

“To get extra financial support or food aid, you need to be close to certain commanders. It’s all about waste [nepotism] now,” Hadi lamented. “That never happened before, the organization used to operate in a fair manner and took good care of its fighters. That is not the case anymore.”

“Fighters are complaining that there is more bureaucracy and red tape, which is making access to basic healthcare more complicated,” another unnamed source said in the report, adding that the combination of excessive spending and sanctions on the terrorist organization is forcing it to increasingly rely on Lebanese government funds.

President Donald Trump significantly increased sanctions on both the Iranian government and Hezbollah throughout his tenure, resulting in mounting reports of financial woes within the terrorist group and its patron government. Last year, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook told Congress that Hezbollah’s finances were so bad that the group was resorting to begging for donations.

“In March [2019], Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, went on TV and made a public appeal for donations,” Hook said. “Hezbollah has placed piggy banks in grocery stores and in retail outlets seeking the spare change of people.”

“Budget cuts” have made it harder of Hezbollah to pay its Syrian Civil War veteran jihadists a bonus they had come to expect, al-Arabiya noted.

In the beginning of the Middle East wing of the pandemic in March, Hezbollah immediately developed a publicity blitz in Lebanon, promising ambulances, hand sanitizers, and medical care. The party had just come off a 2019 in which many of the naiton’s youth had turned against it, organizing large protests demanding a more representative government. By February, given Hezbollah’s ties with Iran, even Lebanese celebrities were openly accusing Hezbollah of bringing the virus to their country.

“Only because we don’t want to upset Hezbollah, we don’t stop Iran flights. On top of all that, they tell us not to panic!” Elissa, a Lebanese pop star, opined.

Al-Arabiya cited a study by the Middle East Policy Center that estimates Hezbollah commands a sprawling healthcare system within Lebanon including “at least three hospitals, 12 health centers, 20 infirmaries, and 20 dental clinics,” largely created to help its jihadists engage in wartime activities in Syria and Iraq.

“Hezbollah says it is turning the organizational might it once deployed to fight Israel or in the civil war in neighboring Syria to battle the spread of the virus pandemic in Lebanon,” the Associated Press reported at the time, noting that Hezbollah was restructuring hospitals used to treat wounded jihadis for coronavirus patients.

In April, Ha’aretz reported that Hezbollah held a parade of 100 ambulances and medical teams affiliated with the terrorist group to galvanize popular support. It also made sure to invite friendly journalists to witness how it was refurnishing medical assets for the Chinese coronavirus “war,” as leader Hassan Nasrallah branded it. Iranian government outlets like PressTV regularly posted content celebrating the jihadist organization. Nasrallah also repeatedly accused the United States of fabricating coronavirus data, branding President Donald Trump and his administration “the worst liars.”

“For Hezbollah, COVID-19 is more than an illness: It’s also an opportunity to amass more political power, especially as one of its representatives, Dr. Hamad Hasan, also heads the Public Health Ministry,” the Israeli newspaper reported.

Last year’s protests in Lebanon have returned despite coronavirus “social distancing” measures. Hundreds took the streets of Tripoli this week after police killed a protester, participating in one of many events demanding the government do more to prevent the collapse of the country’s already precarious economy. The protests turned violent on Tuesday as participants used Molotov cocktails and rocks to attack police.

Lebanon has, at press time, documented 725 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 24 deaths.

['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-30,"Saudi TV Show Features Hebrew Monologue, Calls for Ties with Israel","TEL AVIV – Two new Saudi TV shows sparked outrage among Arab nations and others, including the Hamas terror group, for featuring characters speaking Hebrew and calling for better ties between the Gulf kingdom and Israel.

The opening monologue of the first episode of “Umm Haroun” (The Mother of Aaron) was spoken in Hebrew. “Before our footsteps go missing and our lives fall into memory, we will be lost to time,” a Jewish woman says in the opening scene. “We are the Gulf Jews who were born in the Gulf lands.”

The show, which premiered during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, portrays relations between Muslims and Jews in 1940s Kuwait and features a slew of well-known Saudi and Kuwaiti actors including Hayat al-Fahd, who plays the eponymous heroine.

It also features the character of a rabbi.

Meanwhile a second TV show broadcast in Saudi Arabia, “Exit 7,” includes a character calling for improved relations with Israel. The character also accuses the Palestinians of vilifying Saudi Arabia.

Many critics took to social media to express their outrage.

The Gaza-ruling Hamas terror group said “Umm Haroun” was a “political and cultural attempt to introduce the Zionist project to Persian Gulf society.”

“The character of Umm Haroun reminds me of [Israeli prime minister] Golda Meir, the head of the occupation, who was a murderous criminal. This is the goal of normalization: hatred, slow killing and internal destruction,” Hamas official Ra’fat Murra said.

['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-29,World Jewish Congress President Ron Lauder Blasts De Blasio for ‘Feeding Antsemites’,"TEL AVIV — World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder said his organization should formally censure New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for singling out the Jewish community in a series of tweets over violations of coronavirus restrictions.

“Last night, the Mayor painted the Jewish community as lawbreakers and unconcerned about the city’s public health. I agree with the Mayor that social distancing is vitally important — and last night’s gathering was not appropriate,” Lauder said in a statement.

“But to blame the entire Jewish community is the type of stereotyping that is dangerous and unacceptable at any time, and particularly pernicious while the world is gripped in fear and the worst among us are looking for scapegoats,” he said.

Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews gathered Tuesday night in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn to pay their respects to the deceased, Rabbi Chaim Mertz.

De Blasio personally supervised police as they broke up the funeral procession, which was not carried out in adherence to social distancing regulations although pictures show many wearing masks.

“Something absolutely unacceptable happened in Williamsburg tonite: a large funeral gathering in the middle of this pandemic,” de Blasio wrote on Twitter.

“When I heard, I went there myself to ensure the crowd was dispersed. And what I saw WILL NOT be tolerated so long as we are fighting the Coronavirus,” he said.

“My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed,” the mayor added. “I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period.”

De Blasio came under fire for calling out the Jewish community.

Lauder charged de Blasio with feeding into the “dangerous agenda of white supremacists and antisemites” with his tweet.

Lauder added, “Mayor de Blasio needs to realize that while he, like all of us, believes in the importance of social distancing, every time a leader like him stereotypes the ‘Jewish community,’ he feeds into the dangerous agenda of white supremacists and antisemites around the world. It needs to end.”

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also slammed the mayor.

“Would DeBlasio have sent this identical tweet with the word ‘Jewish’ replaced by any other religious minority? If not, why not? Laws should be enforced neutrally w/o targeting religious faith. #ProtectFreeExercise,” he tweeted.

Anti-Defamation League head Jonathan Greenblatt similarly denounced de Blasio for calling out the entire Jewish community over an errant minority.

Hey @NYCMayor, there are 1mil+ Jewish people in #NYC. The few who don’t social distance should be called out — but generalizing against the whole population is outrageous especially when so many are scapegoating Jews. This erodes the very unity our city needs now more than ever. https://t.co/jcYO9QQred — Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) April 29, 2020

The Satmar Headquarters said on Twitter that the funeral had been approved by the mayor. Satmar is the Hassidic sect that comprises most of the ultra-Orthodox population in Williamsburg.

This Funeral was originally approved and actually organized by @NYPDnews 2 hours b4 it started, PD brought trucks with barriers/tower lights to close off Bedford Avenue and the surrounding area. It's the @NYCMayor’s Dept who originally approved it before deciding to take it back. https://t.co/i1EtGvCkKO — Satmar Headquarters (@HQSatmar) April 29, 2020

Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro blasted de Blasio for his comments.

“I can’t imagine de Blasio saying this about any other community. It’s pretty amazing. And for the record, MANY of the leaders of the Jewish community have taken strong stands on social distancing.”

Twitter user Sofia Bitela wrote: “This is really a tone deaf and disgusting tweet by the mayor. First of all, the [ultra-Orthodox] rarely intermingle outside of their community. How are they a threat to other New Yorkers?”

She added: “Second, they may the community closet to herd immunity in NYC or the US. Leave them alone.”

De Blasio was also criticized for not calling out the hundreds of New Yorkers who gathered, shoulder to shoulder, to watch the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds flyover in honor of the city’s healthcare workers.

Why did DeBlasio single out Jews and not general NYC crowds that gathered to watch flyover? https://t.co/R75FNxMVP8 — Aaron Klein (@AaronKleinShow) April 29, 2020

['John Hayward'],2020-04-29,Taliban Demands Coronavirus Protection for Jailed Jihadis,"The Taliban issued a statement on Wednesday claiming that 46 of its fighters have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus while imprisoned by the Afghan government and vowing to seek revenge if any of them died.

The Taliban statement, as quoted by the Khaama Press Agency, also threatened to hold the United States responsible for not moving quickly enough to free all Taliban operatives from Afghan jails:

We had previously warned that the prisoner situation in the Kabul administration jails is dire as facilities are packed and there are widespread issues regarding food, drink and medicine availability therefore if the novel coronavirus were to enter these prisons, it could prove catastrophic. Responsibility here falls squarely on the shoulders of the United States of America because if it had shown urgency in the implementation of the agreement, we could have made major progress in all facets including the release of prisoners and detainees would have been saved from this danger. The Kabul administration officials along with the supposed human right organizations and those raising humanitarian slogans all failed at taking this issue seriously and have pushed the situation to the brink. The Islamic Emirate has serious concerns about the health of its prisoners and calls on the various international right organizations to not treat this humanitarian issue in a tactful or political manner, but to properly execute their responsibilities in saving the lives of human beings. All sides must understand that if the prisoners of the Islamic Emirate are lost, each one will be asked about and revenge taken upon the cold-hearted enemy.

“Islamic Emirate” is the Taliban’s preferred name for itself, calling back to the days when it controlled the government of Afghanistan.

The Taliban has made the most of the coronavirus as a political and propaganda opportunity, running an ostentatious health campaign and promising not to kill healthcare workers who enter areas under its control, as it previously had a habit of doing.

Long suspicious of Western medicine as a conspiracy to poison its fighters, the Taliban changed course when the coronavirus pandemic hit and began loudly demanding cooperation with medical personnel from Afghans under its control, although there were some reports of continuing reluctance by the Taliban extremists to allow women to visit doctors.

The Taliban claims it is fully cooperating with the World Health Organization and medical teams sent by the government in Kabul while using the pandemic to tighten its control over villages and constantly criticizing the government for an inadequate pandemic response.

Taliban fighters might have sworn off murdering doctors and nurses, but they do not seem reluctant to shoot at anyone else loyal to Kabul. For that matter, the government of President Ashraf Ghani reports Taliban jihadis are still harassing health care workers despite their claims to the contrary.

The Chinese government on Wednesday pledged to send more coronavirus assistance to Afghanistan as the number of confirmed infections approaches 2,000.

“Based on the new demand of Afghanistan for fighting the epidemic, the Chinese embassy in Kabul has arranged another charter flight to deliver the second batch of anti-epidemic materials assistance to Afghanistan,” said Wang Yu, China’s ambassador to Afghanistan.

“The materials we are going to hand over are from China International Development Cooperation Agency and other Chinese organizations. This batch includes more materials than the first batch, including test kits, medical protective masks, surgical masks, protective clothing, protective goggles and infrared temperature guns. The total materials are in 727 boxes, weighing 7.2 tons,” Wang said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/04/29/taliban-demands-coronavirus-protection-for-jailed-jihadis/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-29,Lebanon: Protester Death Triggers Hundreds Rioting,"Hundreds of protesters set two banks on fire and clashed with security forces in Tripoli, Lebanon, on Tuesday, after soldiers shot a man dead during related protests the night before.

Citizens across Lebanon have been demonstrating to express their frustration at the country’s ongoing financial crisis, made worse by recent Chinese coronavirus lockdown measures, Voice of America (VOA) reported on Tuesday.

Some protesters aimed stones at soldiers and launched Molotov cocktails at several banks on Tuesday, causing widespread damage to Tripoli, a largely Sunni Muslim city and one of Lebanon’s most impoverished and neglected areas. Medical and security forces told VOA that Tuesday’s outbursts began shortly after the funeral for a man killed by soldiers during demonstrations on Monday night.

The violence prompted the army to fire rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds of protesters.

Video footage obtained by Saudi news organization al-Arabiya shows demonstrators on Tuesday night gathered in the street, as soldiers are heard firing what seem to be rounds of tear gas and warning shots in the background.

The Lebanese army said that 40 soldiers were wounded in Tripoli and elsewhere in Lebanon on Monday night. Security patrols sent to reopen roads [as part of Lebanon’s easing of coronavirus lockdown measures] were attacked with stones. Nine protesters were arrested for attacking security forces, the Epoch Times reported.

In response to the unrest, Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab reminded the public that “we are facing a new reality” amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures, which threaten to decimate Lebanon’s failing economy.

Diab warned that “malicious intentions behind the scenes” were “shaking stability,” an apparent reference to what the Lebanese army called “infiltrators” who the army blamed for injecting violence into Tripoli’s protests, the Epoch Times reports. The army urged peaceful protesters to leave the streets.

“This is not a riot, this is expressing [anger] that the [U.S.] dollar has reached 4,000 Lebanese pounds … How are people going to eat?” said Tripoli activist Abou Hussein, according to VOA.

Hussein referred to the collapse of the Lebanese pound amid the country’s financial crisis, which has been worsening since October. The economic decline has left tens of thousands of Lebanese unemployed and frustrated, leading many citizens to protest the conditions in Tripoli and other cities.

Lebanon, like most countries around the world, has imposed restrictions on society to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has further pummeled the country’s economy. Lebanon’s coronavirus lockdown measures began on March 15, closing most businesses and allowing only essential movement.

The restrictions have been gradually easing in recent days. Some restrictions may be extended until May 10, Reuters reported on April 24.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/04/29/lebanon-protester-death-triggers-hundreds-rioting-coronavirus-cripples-economy/
['Frances Martel'],2020-04-29,Kurds Blame Jihadist Turkey Allies for Deadly Bombing in Afrin,"Kurdish governing authorities in Afrin, northeast Syria, condemned the Turkish government on Wednesday for enabling jihadist groups they say are responsible for killing over 40 people in a bomb blast in the city the day before.

The Kurdish news outlet Rudaw also reported on Turkey-allied jihadist organizations desecrating Yazidi shrines in the area. While most Yazidis originate in northern Iraq, the Islamic State invasion of their territory in 2014 forced survivors elsewhere, many to Kurdish-held areas in Syria.

The Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) make up much of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of anti-jihadist forces in Rojava, or Syrian Kurdistan. Afrin is located in Rojava and has been under the invasion of Turkish forces and auxiliary groups like the Free Syrian Army (FSA) since the 2018 military attack President Recep Tayyip Erdogan named “Operation Olive Branch.” It is currently occupied by Turkey.

While not formally allied with the YPG, the dictatorship of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad also opposes any Turkish presence in Syria. Erdogan asserted in 2016 that the only reason he would ever send troops across the Syrian border would be to “end the rule of the tyrant Assad.” Both leaders have called each other “terrorists.”

Afrin has been largely occupied by Turkey-allied forces since Operation Olive Branch. After months of a stagnant situation in the area, complicated by concerns of a regional outbreak of Chinese coronavirus, a fuel tanker exploded in the center of the city on Tuesday. The truck, Rudaw reported, was “laced with explosives” and killed 42. The blast injured at least another 50 people, the outlet cited Kurdish sources as saying. The explosion occurred in one of the busiest times of the day in the city; there did not appear to be any social distancing protocols in place.

Rudaw quoted several Kurdish officials who said the dead were civilians in the area, many to visit a crowded market. As the area is largely Kurdish in population, most can be considered Kurds, but many remains are unidentifiable and authorities have not offered the identities of any of the victims.

Kurdish officials in Afrin blame Turkish-affiliated militant groups, though they have not named any in particular. The Turkish government blames the YPG and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).

Turkey considers the YPG and the PKK indistinguishable, although the former is a U.S. ally that played a pivotal role in fighting the Islamic State and the PKK is a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist organization.

No group has taken responsibility for the attack.

“What happened in Afrin yesterday was a condemned terrorist act which claimed the lives of innocent people. This criminal act is the outcome of destructive policy pursued by the Turkish occupation and its mercenaries in the city of peace and olives,” the commander of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, said in a statement on Tuesday.

The SDF, in an official statement separate from Abdi’s, accused Turkey of having “opened the door wide to terrorist forces to reorganize their ranks and carry out cowardly acts under Turkish protection.”

Neither, however, named any group in particular or the Turkish government itself for the attack.

Turkish officials also condemned the bombing but blamed Kurdish groups for it.

“I condemn the heinous terrorist attack on this holy day of Ramadan. I wish Allah’s mercy upon the martyrs and a quick recovery for those wounded,” Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said in a Twitter statement, according to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. “Innocent civilians’ and children’s blood are on the hands of those who support and remain silent in the face of actions of this terrorist organization.”

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu explicitly blamed the attack on “the heinous terrorist organization PKK/YPG.”

“Wishing Allah’s mercy upon the deceased. Those who support the terrorists and trying to take it off the terror list are also responsible for this cowardly attack,” Çavuşoğlu added.

The outlet Kurdistan24, which focuses largely on Iraqi Kurdistan, quoted sources in the area saying they, too, believe that Turkish-backed forces organized the bombing. While stating they had evidence suggesting this, Kurdistan24 did not specify what it was. The “activists” told the outlet that the goal of the bombing was to threaten Kurds into leaving the city “as part of a greater anti-Kurdish program of ethnic cleansing.”

One resident told Rudaw that the explosion was one of three occurring in the city in April, the others of a much smaller scale.

Rudaw also noted that Yazidis in Afrin have reported the destruction of their religious sites in the city, blaming jihadist groups.

“Cemeteries, religious shrines, and Yezidi cemeteries in Afrin have been destroyed, stolen and looted by armed groups, according to local activists,” Rudaw reported, noting that, since the Turkish invasion, the Yazidi population of Afrin has dropped from 35,000 to about 3,000 – an over 90 percent drop in population.

Complaints of Arab jihadist groups allied with Turkey engaging in ethnic cleansing against Kurds, Christians, and other minorities in the area have persisted since Operation Olive Branch launched in 2018.

“Time and time again the indigenous people of Syria are suffering, but this time is at the hands of members of the Turkish military who have been incubating ISIS terrorists,” Khalid Haider, a U.S.-based Yazidi (or Yezidi) activist, told Breitbart News in March 2018. “ISIS militants and their leaders are embedded with the Turkish military, and they are annihilating religious minorities. The world needs to wake up and stop this from happening.”

Haider said the jihadists singled out religious minorities by quizzing them on Islamic practices and killing those who answered incorrectly, resulting in particular harm to Christians and Yazidis. Most Kurds are also Sunni Muslims, however, and are signed out for their ethnicity.

That summer, reports grew of jihadist militias under the auspices of the Turkish government seizing Kurdish businesses and residences in Afrin, forcing the Kurds to relocate and repopulating the area with Arabs and Turks. Some of those captured were reportedly tortured despite being civilians.

The jihadists also desecrated the remains of those they killed. In one particularly harrowing video surfacing in October 2019, jihadists allegedly working alongside “Operation Olive Branch” appeared desecrating the body of a woman SDF fighter killed in battle, shouting “Allahu akbar!” and referring to the woman as a “prostitute.”

['Simon Kent'],2020-04-29,Iran Warns U.S. Navy in Persian Gulf to Ready for 'Hard Slap in the Face',"Iran shrugged off U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent comments about naval confrontation in the contested waters of the Persian Gulf, warning Wednesday a hard slap in the face awaits foreign perpetrators committing even “the merest violation” of the Islamic republic’s territory.

Speaking in a televised program covered by the semi-official Tasnim newsagency, Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi lashed the U.S. for allegedly causing disturbances in the Persian Gulf.

He dismissed Trump’s threat last week that the U.S. Navy will fire at Iranian boats as “psychological warfare” aimed at distracting public attention ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

As Breitbart News reported, Trump had ordered the destruction of Iranian gunboats harassing American ships.

“I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2020

Trump was reacting to ongoing reports of Iranian gunboats that continue harassing American ships in the Persian Gulf.

Last Wednesday, 11 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps gunboats repeatedly harassed six U.S. Navy warships.

Iran acknowledged their aggressive activity but chided the United States for “unprofessional and provocative actions” without offering any evidence of the same.

Now General Shekarchi has warned the U.S. to think about the consequences of any naval challenge, saying, “The Americans must have seen (it before and know well) that if they take the smallest act of aggression against the Islamic Republic’s territorial waters or the interests of our people, they would receive a slap harder than before.”

“It’s no joke when it comes to defending our country,” the general stressed.

Claiming the U.S. is a violator of international law and a problem in the region, the Iranian military official said, “Under such circumstances, if they (the U.S.) make a possible mistake and receive a slap (from Iran), it will be justifiable that they deserve such a slap.”

The General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces last week denounced the presence of American forces in the region as the “root cause of insecurity for regional countries,” warning that any future provocative move by the U.S. military will draw a merciless response from Iran’s most excellent military forces, Tasnim reported.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/04/29/iran-warns-u-s-navy-in-the-persian-gulf-get-ready-for-a-hard-slap-in-the-face/
['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-28,Palestinian Terrorist Attack on Israel’s Memorial Day Injures Woman,"TEL AVIV – A 62-year-old woman was stabbed in a suspected terrorist attack Tuesday, only minutes before a state ceremony honoring Israel’s fallen soldiers and those killed in terror attacks.

The woman, who sustained moderate to severe injuries, was standing at a bus stop near a mall in the central Israeli city of Kfar Saba when a 19-year-old Palestinian youth approached her and began stabbing her. She ran away but the youth, identified as a resident of the West Bank city of Tulkarem, gave chase.

“We gave her life-saving medical care that included stopping the bleeding and urgently evacuated her to the hospital while continuing treatment and reporting to the doctors who were waiting for us.”

Blue and White party head Benny Gantz took to Twitter to wish the woman a speedy recovery and praise the armed civilian who shot the terrorist after the attack.

['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-28,"State Dept. Ready to Recognize Application of Israeli Law in West Bank, Jordan Valley","TEL AVIV – The U.S. on Monday said it was ready to recognize Israel’s annexation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, but asked Israel’s newly formed unity government to also negotiate with the Palestinians.

“As we have made consistently clear, we are prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty and the application of Israeli law to areas of the West Bank that the vision foresees as being part of the State of Israel,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said.

The measure would be “in the context of the Government of Israel agreeing to negotiate with the Palestinians along the lines set forth in President [Donald] Trump’s Vision,” she added, referring to the Trump administration’s peace plan.

“The annexation would be in the context of an offer to the Palestinians to achieve statehood based upon specific terms, conditions, territorial dimensions and generous economic support. This is an unprecedented and highly beneficial opportunity for the Palestinians,” the State Department spokesperson said.

Trump’s plan, which was rejected by the Palestinians sight unseen, would see the establishment of a contiguous but demilitarized Palestinian state on most of the West Bank with parts of eastern Jerusalem that are outside the Israeli security fence as its capital.

Jerusalem would remain undivided and under Israeli control.

Israel would be allowed to annex all Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jordan Valley.

On Wednesday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas threatened to cancel all agreements with Israel and the U.S. if Israel went through with annexation.

His comments came in response to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s assertion that annexation was “ultimately Israel’s decision to make.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said he was confident the U.S. would give Israel the approval in the next two months to move ahead with the plans.

“Three months ago, the Trump peace plan recognized Israel’s rights in all of [the West Bank],” Netanyahu said. “And President Trump pledged to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Jewish communities there and in the Jordan Valley.”

“A couple of months from now, I’m confident that that pledge will be honored,” Netanyahu said.

According to the terms of the deal, the issue of annexation can be voted in the Knesset on July 1 at the earliest, “after discussion between the prime minister and alternate prime minister” and with U.S. consent.

Netanyahu will serve as prime minister for a year and a half after which Gantz will replace him.

“In relation to President Trump’s declaration,” the coalition agreement states, “the prime minister and alternate prime minister will act with the US’s full agreement including mapping and international dialogue on the subject, while aiming to protect Israel’s security and strategic interests, including the need to preserve regional stability, peace agreements and working towards future peace agreements.”

The proposed measure has drawn criticism from the international community.

E.U. and U.N. officials warned against the move, with E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying it “would constitute a serious violation of international law” and the U.N. Middle East peace envoy, Nikolay Mladenov, saying it would result in a “devastating blow” to the two-state solution and regional peace.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/04/28/us-to-recognize-israel-annexation-of-west-bank-jordan-valley/

Bennett said the IDF would not stop taking military action against Iranian forces in Syria until they leave the country.

“We have moved from blocking Iran’s entrenchment in Syria to forcing it out of there, and we will not stop,” the defense minister said in a statement.

“We will not allow more strategic threats to grow just across our borders without taking action,” he said.

He made similar comments two days earlier, ahead of an alleged Israeli airstrike on an Iranian base outside Damascus.

“Keep your ears open. We’ve gone from a policy of blocking [Iran] to pushing it out,” Bennett told the 103FM radio station on Sunday according to remarks translated by The Times of Israel.

The strike, on the Mezzeh military airport in a suburb outside the capital, killed four members of a pro-Iran militia and three civilians, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

However, according to Syrian state news agency SANA, whose reliability is questionable at best, some damage was caused by the strikes on the building but there were no casualties.

SANA also reported Syrian air defense shot down the Israeli projectiles.

The airbase, said to be used by Iranian forces in Syria, has been targeted several times in alleged Israeli airstrikes.

Monday’s bombing raid was the third such attack in Syria attributed to Israel in the past 10 days.

Last week, Syria accused Israel of carrying out airstrikes on targets near Homs in the center of the country. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor later said the targets were “military posts for Iranian militias in the Palmyra desert.”

['John Hayward'],2020-04-28,Iran Arrests Editor and Journalist for Cartoon Mocking Ayatollah Khamenei,"The editor-in-chief of the Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) and one of his employees were arrested last week for publishing a cartoon on social media deemed “insulting” to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The cartoon was posted on the evening of April 23 and deleted only a few minutes later. ILNA issued a statement that night denying that the cartoon had ever been published.

“At a time when prisons are petri dishes for the COVID-19 virus, Iranian authorities should cease locking up journalists for trivial offenses like allegedly sharing a cartoon,” Sheri Mansour of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said on Monday.

According to Radio Free Europe (RFE), editor Masud Heydari is out on bail, but social media administrator Hamid Haghjoo is still imprisoned. No formal charges appear to have been filed against either of them yet, but an “investigation” is underway:

“Immediately after the publishing of the insulting image, it was ordered to be removed from the channel,” Alghasi Mehr was quoted as saying by Iranian media. “The [person in charge] of ILNA and the administrator of the Telegram channel were both arrested on the evening of [April 23],” he added. ILNA has denied any affiliation with the “disrespectful” cartoon while accusing its opponents of having faked the news agency’s logo and falsely accused it of publishing the cartoon. The cartoon mocks those promoting fake treatments to ward off the coronavirus, including drinking camel urine and inserting violet oil in the anus, under the guise of Islamic medicine. It appeared to suggest that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is supportive of such measures, depicting him as a nurse who is calling for silence.

RFE provided a copy of the cartoon. It was originally shared using ILNA’s account on the encrypted messaging platform Telegram, which is very popular in Iran. The other caricatures are of Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian, the “father of Islamic medicine,” and Mehdi Sabili, the “Islamic medicine specialist” who urged Iranians to drink camel urine:

Sabili on Sunday instructed his 60,000 Instagram followers to beat lung diseases, asthma, and the Wuhan virus by enjoying three tall glasses of camel urine per day, preferably in the “initial hot temperature” it enjoys when emerging from the camel.

Drinking camel urine is actually one of the less hideous of these “Islamic medicine” treatments. Ayatollah Tabrizian’s contribution to coronavirus quackery was the suggestion to “insert velvet oil into the anus,” while another imam has been telling his followers they need only sniff a special perfume to ward off the disease. The perfume imam got at least one of his followers killed, while several genuine medical doctors have been flogged for questioning Tabrizian’s posterior prescription.

Over 700 Iranians have been killed by guzzling methanol, which they believe kills the coronavirus even though it is a form of alcohol technically prohibited under Islamic law. Belief in methanol as a coronavirus treatment apparently began because some Iranians thought their reluctance to drink liquor was the reason their country suffered such a severe outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, and because high-proof alcohol is an ingredient in some hand sanitizers. Since the early days of the pandemic, Iranian social media accounts have been buzzing with false stories of foreigners curing themselves of Covid-19 by drinking whiskey.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/04/28/iran-arrests-editor-and-journalist-for-cartoon-mocking-ayatollah-khamenei/
['Breitbart London'],2020-04-28,Lebanon Sees Mass Protests as Economy Falters,"AFP — Lebanese protesters confronted army troops for a second day Tuesday as anger over a spiralling economic crisis re-energised a months-old anti-government movement in defiance of a coronavirus lockdown.

Scuffles resumed in second city Tripoli in northern Lebanon as protesters hurled rocks at security forces who fired a volley of tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the demonstrators.

The violence came after a protester died on Tuesday from a bullet wound he had sustained during overnight confrontations between troops and hundreds of demonstrators in Tripoli.

Following the funeral of 26-year-old Fawaz al-Samman in the city’s central Al-Nour Square, demonstrators went on the rampage, torching and vandalising banks and military vehicles.

Sixty people were injured, including some 40 soldiers, during the overnight exchange which saw protesters throw stones at troops who fired live rounds into the air to try to disperse the angry crowds under clouds of tear gas.

Tuesday’s confrontations were the latest in a string of anti-government protests and social unrest fuelled by unprecedented inflation and a free-falling Lebanese pound that reached record lows against the dollar this week.

Angered by the financial collapse, demonstrators have rallied across Lebanon, blocking roads and attacking banks, re-energising a protest movement launched in October against a political class the activists deem inept and corrupt.

“I came down to raise my voice against hunger, poverty and rising prices,” Khaled, 41, told AFP, saying he had lost his job selling motorcycle parts and could no longer support his three children.

– ‘Increasingly desperate’ –

Lebanon is mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, now compounded by a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus which has killed 24 people and infected almost 700 others.

The Lebanese pound has lost more than half of its value on the black market, where it traded at a record low of around 4,000 pounds to the dollar this week.

Economy Minister Raoul Nehme on Tuesday said that prices have risen by 55 per cent, while the government estimates that 45 per cent of the population now lives below the poverty line.

This has unleashed a public outcry against a government that has yet to deliver a long awaited rescue plan to shore up the country’s finances more than three months since it was nominated to address the crisis.

Prime Minister Hassan Diab acknowledged that living conditions have “deteriorated at a record speed” but said on Tuesday he would not tolerate “riots” and that perpetrators would be held accountable.

UN envoy to Lebanon Jan Kubis said that the “tragic” events in Tripoli send a “warning signal”.

“This is the time to provide material support to increasingly desperate, impoverished and hungry majority of Lebanese” he said in a post on Twitter.

– ‘Social explosion’ –

Lebanon’s economic crises, compounded by unprecedented inflation and a record devaluation of the pound, has forced large chunks of the population into unemployment.

A kilo of meat which used to sell at 18,000 Lebanese pounds ($12 at the official rate) now costs 32,000 (around $22) while the price of vegetables has doubled.

With no clear government plan to exit the crisis, Lebanon is heading “towards an inevitable social explosion” Sami Nader, director of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs, told AFP.

Public anger has been increasingly directed at banks which are accused by protesters of helping a corrupt political class drive the country towards bankruptcy.

Lebanese banks, many of which are owned by prominent politicians, have since September imposed restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers, forcing the public to deal in the nose-diving Lebanese pound.

Since March, banks have stopped dollar withdrawals altogether, further fuelling public anger.

In Tripoli, the army accused demonstrators overnight of torching three banks, destroying several ATM machines and attacking an army patrol and military vehicle.

The Association of Lebanese Banks said that commercial banks would be closed in Tripoli on Tuesday because of “attacks and acts of vandalism”.

In the capital Beirut, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a bank before dawn and dozens of protesters gathered at a flyover to express solidarity with their counterparts in Tripoli.

In the southern city of Sidon, protesters threw stones and fire crackers at the central bank headquarters late Monday, state media said.

Late Saturday, assailants lobbed an explosive device at a bank in Sidon.

The attack came a day after Diab said Lebanese bank deposits had plunged $5.7 billion in the first two months of the year, despite curbs on withdrawals and a ban on transfers abroad.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/04/28/lebanon-sees-mass-protests-as-economy-falters/
['Ben Kew'],2020-04-28,Iran: Over 700 Die After Drinking Methanol as 'Cure' for Coronavirus,"More than 700 Iranians have died after ingesting toxic methanol in the false belief that it provides a cure for the Chinese coronavirus, according to figures from the country’s national coroner’s authority reproduced by Australia’s ABC News on Tuesday.

The authority released a report on Monday claiming that 728 Iranians had died as a result of alcohol poisoning between February 20 and April 7. In 2019, there were only 66 deaths from the same cause across the entire year.

The figures contradict those provided by Iranian health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, who said that 525 people had died in that same time period. Yet a ministry adviser, Dr. Hossein Hassanian, told the Associated Press that the number of victims was higher than the official government tally as many people died outside of hospitals.

“Some 200 people died outside of hospitals,” he said. “Other countries have only one problem, which is the new coronavirus pandemic. But we are fighting on two fronts here. We have to both cure the people with alcohol poisoning and also fight the coronavirus.”

Fake remedies are increasingly popular across Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the Islamic regime’s response to the virus after it attempted to downplay the severity of the situation before it became widespread.

Methanol, which is a form of pure alcohol, remains illegal in Iran because of Sharia, the Islamic law. However, various bootleggers sell the product on the black market, touting its supposed benefits. Its consumption can lead to initial symptoms of chest pain, nausea, and hyperventilation, while its delayed effects include blindness and organ damage.

“People think that alcohol causes immunity to corona while drinking alcohol does not eliminate corona in the body,” the state-run Tasnim News Agency quoted one medical expert as saying. “This misconception has caused even children to drink alcohol … which can lead to death and blindness.”

Alcohol is not the only fake treatment spreading across Iran, one of the countries most severely impacted by the coronavirus. Last month, state media promoted various herbal treatments as a cure for the virus, while an Islamic prophetic medicine healer recently prescribed camel urine to his patients suffering from symptoms.

As of Tuesday morning, Iranian medical authorities had confirmed 92,584 cases of the coronavirus and 5,877 fatalities. At least 72,439 people have already made a full recovery. Yet various officials, including the head of the Tehran city council, have questioned the legitimacy of such figures, arguing than the “actual numbers are several times higher than what is being announced by the government.”

['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-04-28,Erdogan Backs Cleric Who Claims Homosexuality Brings Disease,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday threw his weight behind Turkey’s top Muslim cleric, who caused a storm by claiming homosexuality “brings disease and causes this generation to decay.”

In his first sermon during the holy month of Ramadan on Friday, Ali Erbas also maintained that hundreds of thousands of people every year are exposed to HIV due to homosexuality and adultery and called on worshipers to come together to fight “this kind of evil.”

Opposition and rights groups condemned the comments by Erbas, who heads Turkey’s Religious Affairs Presidency.

But in a public address following a Cabinet meeting Monday, Erdogan said any attack on Erbas amounted to an attack on the state.

Erdogan — a pious Muslim whose ruling party has roots in Turkey’s Islamic movement — said Erbas had fulfilled the duties of “faith, the wisdom (of Islam) and of his office” and that his words were binding for all Muslims. He said the tone of the criticism against the cleric had turned into a “deliberate attack against Islam.”

The Ankara-based Human Rights Association has filed a criminal complaint against Erbas, accusing him of sedition, and the Ankara lawyers’ association accused him of inciting hatred. The association called for his removal from office, saying it would not be surprised if the cleric were next to call on people “to light torches and burn women as witches.”

Meanwhile, the Ankara chief prosecutor’s office said it was launching a criminal investigation against the Ankara lawyers’ group for “insulting religious values.” Many ruling party officials and supporters have also rallied around Erbas on Twitter.

The fatalities recorded in the past 24 hours brought to 5,877 the overall death toll from the illness in the Middle East’s hardest-hit country.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 1,112 people tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.

That took to 92,584 the total number of infections recorded in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February.

Iran says 72,439 of those admitted to hospital with the virus have recovered and been discharged.

Its latest figures came a day after the ministry announced its daily infection count had fallen to 991 — below 1,000 for the first time since March 10.

Doubts have been cast over Iran’s coronavirus casualty figures by experts and officials both at home and abroad.

State television on Tuesday aired footage from Tehran grocery stores where posters urged customers to observe social distancing rules.

“The majority do not respect these instructions,” a salesman told the channel.

A bus driver complained about passengers who were failing to abide by government guidelines.

“People always pay in cash,” he said, expressing concern over a method of payment discouraged by the authorities as it increases the risk of the virus spreading.

Iran’s government ordered the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and stadiums among other public spaces in March in order to halt the spread of the virus.

But it has allowed a phased reopening of shops and has lifted restrictions on movement within the country since April 11.

The perennially cool defense minister continues to answer the news anchor’s questions, stopping only to kiss or caress the young interloper.

Bennett was discussing Israel’s exit strategy from the coronavirus lockdown in an interview from his home Saturday night when his son sauntered into the frame, apparently seeking some TLC from his famous dad.

﻿

The news anchor asks Bennett, who is the head of the right-wing Yamina party, whether the newly formed unity government between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and erstwhile rival Blue and White chief Benny Gantz was throwing Bennett’s own party to the curb during coalition negotiations.

Bennett embraces his son, David, but seems unperturbed by either the question nor his son’s sudden presence.

“I came to [politics] to make a difference,” Bennett said.

“I could have stayed in hitech and made millions, or been with my family,” the former entrepreneur said, and kissed his son on the forehead to drive the point home.

The anchor concluded the interview by thanking Bennett and telling him to “go and make an omelette for your son.”

Commenting about the article on Twitter, international human rights lawyer and pro-Israel activist Arsen Ostrovsky described the interview as “beautiful.”

['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-04-27,Saudi Arabia Ends Capital Punishment for Crimes Committed by Children,"(UPI) — Saudi Arabia will no longer execute individuals convicted of crimes committed when they were minors, the U.N. Human Rights Commission said.

Citing a royal decree signed by King Salman, Human Rights Commission President Awwad Alawwad announced the decision Sunday, saying it will help modernize the Middle Eastern country’s penal code.

“The decree means that any individuals who received a death sentence for crimes committed while he or she is a minor can no longer face execution,” Alawwad said in a statement. “Instead, the individuals will receive a prison sentence of no longer than 10 years in a juvenile detention facility.”

Such use of capital punishment is against the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Saudi Arabia has ratified.

The decree was announced nearly a week after Amnesty International released its 2019 global review of the death penalty detailing that Saudi Arabia executed 184 people last year, putting the Kingdom among the top five countries that administer executions as punishment.

Published Tuesday, the report said the majority of Saudi Arabia’s executions were for drug and murder convictions, though the international human rights organization said it had documented an increase of the punishment being used against religious minority dissidents.

It was unclear when the decree was issued or when it would be in effect but it was announced days after Saudi Arabia ended flogging as punishment in disciplinary cases.

Alawwad said the two decisions are examples of how Saudi Arabia is reforming its human rights record and reflects the Kingdom’s commitment to Prince Mohammed bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz’s Vision 2030 plan that aims to reduce the country’s economic dependence on oil. The plan calls for several progressive social reforms, including increasing the presence of women in the workplace.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-02,Report: China May Lose $200 Billion in Belt and Road Africa Wing,"China could lose about $200 billion from poor infrastructure investments in Africa amid the economic downturn caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei reported on Friday.

Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China promotes economically predatory infrastructure projects in developing nations to broaden its influence. In Africa, many expect China’s BRI investments to turn belly up amid the emerging economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, global supply and demand chains have been significantly disrupted as most countries around the world have essentially shut down their economies to comply with government-mandated lockdowns meant to curb the spread of the virus.

Demand for one of China’s main African investments, oil, has dropped drastically in recent weeks due to the coronavirus disruption, with the price of oil going negative for the first time ever. As individuals and big businesses are forced to halt activities, less fuel is used for both personal transportation and large cargo vehicles alike.

Africa — an impoverished continent facing some of the worst economic prospects in the world post-coronavirus pandemic, according to financial experts — will almost certainly see its nations default on their burdensome BRI loans.

China’s economic output fell 6.8 percent in the first quarter of this year, the Nikkei reports, adding that it seems doubtful that Beijing will have sufficient resources to fund African BRI projects in the future. As evidence, the report cites the absence of references in the communiques of recent political bureau meetings of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to BRI as a priority.

China views Africa mainly as a source of natural resources for the country’s growing demand in recent years. Beijing buys raw materials — such as oil, minerals, and metals — from Africa. China imports crude petroleum from Angola, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Republic of Congo. In addition, China imports several minerals and metals from Africa, including iron and titanium from Sierra Leone; zinc and copper ore from Eritrea; and cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

China has committed nearly $200 billion in bilateral loans and FDI (foreign direct investment) in Africa through its BRI projects, according to the Nikkei.

It is likely that China could have paid the same — or less — for the raw materials, like oil and metals, it procures from Africa had it chosen to purchase them on the open market, the Nikkei article argued. According to the article, Beijing has invested in Africa hoping that more direct control of resources would provide greater security, but this has proven to be largely untrue, especially on a continent as insecure and volatile as Africa.

China’s own citizens have denounced the country’s BRI investments in Africa. In the fall of 2018, as dozens of African leaders prepared to fly to Beijing for a BRI summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, domestic criticism of the BRI projects in Africa made international headlines.

“Why is China, a country with over 100 million people who are still living below the poverty line, playing at being the flashy big-spender?” wrote Xu Zhangrun, an influential Tsinghua University law professor, in a critique of Xi in July 2018, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.

Another critic of China’s investment in Africa, Sun Wenguang, was arrested live on air by Chinese police as he voiced his concerns over China’s BRI projects during a Voice of America (VOA) radio show in August 2018. Sun, a retired university professor, criticized Xi’s spending in Africa on his show and argued that China was overlooking the poverty suffered by its own people.

As the police ripped him off-air, Sun could be heard saying, “Listen to what I say, is it wrong?”

“Regular people are poor, let’s not throw our money away in Africa … throwing money around like this doesn’t do any good for our country or our society,” Sun argued.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/05/02/report-china-may-lose-200-billion-in-belt-and-road-africa-wing/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-01,Experts: West African Child Labor May Spike Due to Coronavirus,"Experts warn that coronavirus-related school closures in West Africa during the local cocoa harvest season could cause a spike in child labor in Ivory Coast and Ghana, Reuters reported on Thursday.

The two West African nations produce a combined 65 percent of the world’s cocoa supply, according to the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). Child labor has long been an issue in West African cocoa production, despite pledges from major chocolate companies that use the local cocoa, such as Nestle and Hershey, to reduce the exploitation, Reuters noted.

Currently, over two million children work in the cocoa sector in Ghana and Ivory Coast, a spike from a decade again, reported Reuters, citing a draft of a U.S. government-sponsored report seen by the news agency this month. Both Ghana and Ivory Coast prohibit child labor by law, but the laws are loosely enforced. In Ghana, the minimum age for work is 15 years old, while in Ivory Coast the minimum age is 14 years old. West Africa is currently in its mid-season cocoa harvesting period, according to Reuters.

Fairtrade Africa, a non-profit organization representing all Fairtrade certified producers in Africa, said it had received reports of possible cases of child labor in Ivory Coast’s eastern and western regions in recent weeks and has flagged them to the government.

“In normal circumstances, children are already vulnerable, and now they are not going to school [due to coronavirus shutdowns],” Anne-Marie Yao, regional cocoa manager for Fairtrade Africa, told Reuters.

The coronavirus pandemic has prevented Fairtrade Africa from having staff on the ground in West Africa upon whom they normally rely for information about child labor violations, Yao said. In addition, local shelters where rescued children are normally taken have closed due to coronavirus lockdowns.

“If the current situation continues an increase in child labor is very likely,” Nick Weatherill, executive director of the International Cocoa Initiative, a Swiss-based foundation working to eradicate child labor, told Reuters. Economic losses due to the coronavirus pandemic will also be a risk factor forcing children to work, Weatherill added.

According to Yao, school teachers are often the first to notice and report child abuse in West Africa. Yao suggested that Ghana and Ivory state governments could instruct public school teachers to somehow stay in touch with their students to maintain this line of communication despite school closures.

Last week, Ivory Coast’s national anti-trafficking committee released a statement reminding parents that child labor is punishable by law, Reuters reported. “The harvest season and the closing of schools must not be an excuse for violating children’s rights,” said Ivory Coast’s First Lady Dominique Ouattara, who heads the anti-trafficking committee.

On March 24, Ivory Coast declared a state of emergency as part of its response to the coronavirus pandemic. The act called for “gradual confinement measures” restricting people’s movement in an effort to curb virus transmission. Ghana recently eased a three-week lockdown in certain parts of the country to slow the spread of coronavirus.

On Thursday, the Associated Press (AP) reported a spike in Ghana’s coronavirus cases just ten days after the lockdown was lifted. The number of infections surged to over 2,000 on Thursday, a 24 percent increase over a matter of days, according to AP.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-01,Tanzania Arrests Lawyer for Saying Coronavirus a ‘Real Threat’,"Police arrested a prominent lawyer in Tanzania on Wednesday for saying the Chinese coronavirus was “serious” and “a real threat,” Tanzanian newspaper The Citizen reported.

Arusha Regional Police Commander Koka Moita confirmed to The Citizen that Albert Msando was being detained at the Arusha Central police station on Wednesday night.

Moita said Msando “was being interrogated over statements he made regarding Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus],” but did not elaborate, according to the newspaper. The Citizen quoted a source who said Msando drove himself to the police station that evening after receiving a summons from authorities.

According to the newspaper, Msando’s arrest followed shortly after Arusha Regional Commissioner Mrisho Gambo ordered the police to arrest any person communicating “conflicting public information on coronavirus,” presumably information which conflicts with the official government statements on the matter.

On Tuesday, Msando said the coronavirus pandemic was serious and a real threat in Arusha, and that the city was reeling from the pandemic. He urged journalists to report truthfully on what was happening regarding the city’s coronavirus outbreak so that proper preventive measures could be taken by the public, The Citizen reported.

These comments were made after Msando handed out masks and hand sanitizer to Arusha journalists so that they could protect themselves from the virus, the newspaper added.

News of Msando’s detention comes on the same day Tanzanian President John Magufuli was criticized most recently for failing to take the threat of the coronavirus pandemic seriously. On Wednesday, Tanzania’s main political opposition said the president was in a “state of denial” about the worsening situation in Tanzania regarding the coronavirus, where the number of cases has surged dramatically over the past few weeks, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).

On March 16, Tanzania recorded its first case of coronavirus. In a little over two weeks, the number of cases has surged from 32 to 480 at press time on Thursday, with 16 deaths.

Tanzania remains one of the few African countries not taking extensive measures against the coronavirus pandemic yet. Schools and universities in the country have closed but markets, public transportation, and shops remain open.

Freeman Mbowe, of the opposition Chadema party, accused the government of hiding information about the coronavirus in a speech broadcast online on Wednesday, AFP reported.

“We see people dying and their burials are supervised by the government under strict conditions but yet it is not telling us they died of coronavirus. There is no transparency and when people have no information, you provide room for rumors. The government is telling us only 16 [people] died of coronavirus but this is a joke,” he said. The president was in a “state of denial,” Mbowe added.

Last month, Magufuli claimed God would protect Tanzanians from the coronavirus, not facemasks. He has urged people to keep going about their routines as usual. “This is time to build our faith and continue praying to God and not depending on facemasks. Don’t stop going to churches and mosques for prayers. I’m sure this is just a change of wind and it will go like others have gone,” Magufuli said at a church in Dodoma in March.

['Frances Martel'],2020-04-30,South Africa's Health Workers Protest Imported Cuban Slave Doctors,"Doctors and nurses in South Africa protested the arrival of over 200 Cuban slave doctors to the country this week after reports surfaced indicating the country would have to pay the Communist regime far more than it would have if it had just hired local doctors.

South Africa’s government argued that importing Cuban slave doctors was necessary to fight the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Reports indicate Cuba makes as much as $11 billion a year sending its doctors worldwide and pays them a tiny portion of those proceeds, only a living “stipend” to prevent them from becoming homeless or starving. The Organization of American States (OAS) has referred to the Cuban slave doctor program as “human trafficking.”

South Africa’s New24 documented the arrival of 217 Cuban slave doctors to Waterkloof airforce base in South Africa on Monday, identifying them as “family physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, healthcare technology engineers, biotechnology experts, and other specialists.”

Cuban Health Specialists arrive in South Africa to support efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. pic.twitter.com/jxPVIHI0VJ — Department of Health: COVID-19 (@COVID_19_ZA) April 26, 2020

“We ask[ed] the government of Cuba and the people of Cuba to send a multidisciplinary team of experts and health professionals. These men and women are to work alongside South African health professionals in our response to Covid-19 [the Chinese coronavirus disease],” South Africa’s International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor reportedly said upon their arrival. “Cuba has once again proven the character of its nation through its act of international human solidarity.”

The Cuban communist regime enjoys an outsized positive reputation in South Africa due to dictator Fidel Castro’s longstanding support for Nelson Mandela, particularly prior to his release and ascent to leading the country out of the Apartheid era.

South African journalists have published several reports estimating the price of this “human solidarity.” The online newspaper Daily Maverick reported on Thursday that documents believed to be from the South African government suggest that the price of the hundreds of doctors is at least 439,916,337 rand (nearly $24 million), though that price is based on a smaller number of doctors that those who actually arrived. The outlet noted that “both the Treasury and the Department of Health failed to respond to repeated requests for comment on the matter from Daily Maverick and other media outlets – which in itself may be revealing.”

Business Day, another South African newspaper, appears to be the origin of the documents in question. South Africa’s The Times estimated that, if accurate, the price for the total service means that it costs about 2.35 million rand ($127,624.79) per Cuban doctor, far more than the regular salary for a South African doctor.

News24 confirmed the veracity of the document showing that price. The outlet reported the doctors would not be able to work for a 14-day period in which they will be held in quarantine. It is not clear if Cuba is being paid for services that would otherwise have been rendered during those two weeks.

The South African Medical Association (SAMA) told Business Day that “a public sector registrar or mid-level medical officer, comparable to a Cuban family physician, commands a salary of about R1.2m [$65,170.10] a year.”

“Retired doctors can be brought back into the service delivery system – even for a short time. They can also mentor younger doctors who lack the necessary experience and skills,” Dr. Angeline Coetzee, the chairwoman of SAMA, said in response to the imported doctors. “Only when we have exhausted all our internal human resources should a consultative process between SAMA, the Department of Health, and the Presidency been initiated to bring the Cuban specialists to South Africa.”

“While we are not averse to the so-called Cuban Brigade assisting us, we feel strongly that the principle of not engaging with SAMA – as the biggest representative body of doctors in the country – is flawed and wrong,” Coetzee added.

The organization said in another statement that neglecting the employment needs of local doctors was a mistake.

“There are many unemployed doctors in South Africa and many community service medical officers have still not been placed. In addition, many private practitioners have indicated their willingness to assist,” SAMA asserted.

The Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa), through a spokesperson, also described the influx of slave doctors as a “bitter pill to swallow” for unemployed South African health workers.

“It is quite a depressing situation where government goes ahead and takes decisions like this, especially in a country like ours where we know that there are quite a lot of unemployed health professionals sitting at home,” spokesman Kevin Halama said, according to News24.

The outlet also noted that Denosa, a South African nurses’ union, called the move “unpatriotic,” and the South African Internationally Trained Health Professionals Association (SAITHPA) protested that it is much easier for a Cuban national to receive approval to practice medicine in the country than for a South African.

“Their [the domestic health workers’] bewilderment and disappointment in relation to the disregard shown by the HPCSA [health authorities] to them is now further enhanced by the recent importation of medical personnel from Cuba, as these unemployed medical graduates wonder why R440-million of money from their taxpaying parents has been used to import doctors whilst they remain unemployed and willing to serve through the necessary channels,” SAITHPA said in a statement.

South Africa’s Health department protested that it was “not fair” for anyone to question the price of the Cuban doctors.

South Africa’s medical professionals join those in several other African countries, including Uganda and Kenya, who have objected to being displaced by Cuban slaves. All have protested that their national organizations were not included in decisions on importing the doctors and some countries have had to develop programs in which their local doctors “mentor” the Cubans, as the Castro regime did not provide them sufficient medical training to allow them safe access to patients alone.

Cuban doctors who have escaped the system say they are barely paid enough to eat and that most of their work consists of falsifying medical records to appear more productive than they actually are. At a press conference in Washington last year, one Cuban doctor who served in Bolivia said she was forced to “see” non-existent patients and “prescribe” them medicine. The doctors then destroyed the medicine to claim they had successfully treated the “patient.”

“They tell us often in Cuba that education is free, therefore we are their property,” Tatiana Carballo, one of the doctors, said at the time. “From the moment we graduate, we receive very, very low salaries, then begin medical missions abroad.”

['Ben Kew'],2020-04-29,Madagascar Forces Coronavirus Mask Violators to Clean Streets,"Police in Antananarivo, Madagascar, on Monday introduced a somewhat unconventional punishment against citizens caught not wearing masks in public, forcing violators to clean the city’s streets.

The new rule came into effect this week after President Andry Rajoelina announced the compulsory wearing of sanitary masks outdoors in public as a condition for the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions across the country’s major cities imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Originally, authorities had warned citizens caught ignoring the rules that they would face community service. They may not have anticipated that the service would involve sweeping the capital’s streets and picking up trash.

“From Monday, April 20th, people going out of their homes will be required to wear masks. A free distribution is planned from April 20th to 26th, in the towns that have registered contact cases (Antananarivo, Toamasina and Fianarantsoa),” reads guidance on the country’s tourist site. “Starting from Monday, April 27, anyone not wearing a mask will be required to perform community service (cleaning of gardens, schools, or streets).”

In an interview with local television, the leader of the coronavirus response operations General Elak Olivier Andriakaja said that the punishment was fair because citizens had been made aware of the new rules through an awareness campaign. He added that around 70 percent of people were obeying the rule.

General Elak Olivier Andriakaja, leader of the anti-coronavirus operations, told state television that most people were respecting the rules.

“Seventy percent of people on the street respected the rule … because they are scared of having to sweep pavements,” he said. “Measures were taken before the sanctions fell into place to raise awareness and distribute mouth covers. I think that’s enough and that sanctions must now be applied.”

Police deputy head Christian Rakotobe told AFP that around 500 people were penalized on Monday alone for violating the rules, 25 of whom were forced to start cleaning the streets immediately.

Among the other somewhat bizarre guidance on the country’s tourism website, the government also boasted of a new herbal remedy “based on a medicinal plant called artemisia which has curative and preventive virtues to fight coronavirus symptoms.” According to researchers, there is currently no scientifically proven treatment for the virus.

As of Wednesday, the island of 26.26 million people has reported only 128 cases of the Chinese coronavirus. Of the infected, 90 patients have already recovered and no fatalities have been recorded.

Madagascar is not the only nation to introduce unusual punishments for those disobeying lockdown measures. Last week, officials in Indonesia’s Central Java began forcing quarantine violators to stay in a haunted house in isolation.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-29,South Africa: Criminals Stash Drugs in Coffins During Lockdown,"A province in South Africa has identified a “new trend” in which criminals use coffins and hearses to transport illegal drugs during the nation’s coronavirus lockdown, South Africa’s News24 reported.

On March 27, South Africa’s government initiated a nationwide lockdown in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus. During the shutdown, due to last until the end of April, travel is allowed only for essential services and social distancing is enforced. South Africa’s coronavirus lockdown has been considered one of the strictest on the African continent, and it includes a ban on alcohol sales.

Faced with the alcohol sale ban and travel restrictions, criminals have devised creative ways to traffic illegal provisions. News24 reports that in KwaZulu-Natal, a coastal province, criminals have been impersonating funeral home staff – who have fewer lockdown restrictions as they are considered essential workers – to hide and transport drugs.

On April 25, in the town of Underberg, police officers noticed a vehicle belonging to a funeral parlor. The officers stopped and searched the car, and discovered liquor inside the vehicle. The car’s occupants were then arrested.

Earlier the same day, in the town of Pongola, two alleged drug dealers were arrested after they were caught in possession of 176 pounds of marijuana stashed in a coffin they were transporting. The individuals were posing as funeral home employees when they were stopped by police officers manning a roadblock, searched, and arrested.

“We welcome the significant progress made by our law enforcement authorities in the apprehension of those who have sought to violate the regulations of the lockdown,” Sihle Zikalala, KwaZulu-Natal’s premier said at a press conference on Sunday, News24 reports. “We want to commend the law enforcement operations for upscaling efforts to ensure compliance with lockdown regulations,” he added.

Zikala also described the drug traffickers impersonating funeral home staff as a “new trend” in his province.

On April 20, several South African policemen were arrested for drinking at a bar, which violated the nation’s ban on alcohol sales during the coronavirus lockdown.

On April 23, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government will allow a partial reopening of the economy on May 1, easing travel restrictions and allowing some industries to resume operations. At press time on Tuesday, South Africa had 4,996 infections and 93 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/29/south-africa-criminals-stash-drugs-in-coffins-during-coronavirus-lockdown/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-29,"Report: Uganda Raids LGBT Shelter, Claiming Coronavirus Violations","Local authorities in Uganda are facing accusations of raiding an LGBT shelter based on the perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of the residents, then charging them for allegedly defying coronavirus regulations on physical distancing, AllAfrica reported on Monday.

The incident reportedly occurred in Kyengera, a town in central Uganda, on March 29.

“We are deeply concerned about a raid on an LGBT shelter in Kyengera on March 29 and the arrest and detention of 19 people perceived to be LGBT persons,” the United Nations (U.N.) said in a statement released on Monday.

“[U.N.] experts are alarmed that Uganda could be using COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] emergency laws to target gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender [LGBT] people, and urged the government to strictly limit the use of emergency power to public health issues,” the statement said.

The U.N. also expressed concern that the detainees in this case allegedly have no access to their lawyer due to unspecified coronavirus measures.

“The right to access to legal assistance is a fundamental human right afforded to everyone,” the statement pointed out. The U.N. asked Uganda to include the Kyengera detainees in a planned future release of 2,000 inmates in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus in prisons.

On April 6, the Uganda Prisons Service listed 2,000 prisoners who have served part of their sentences across the country to be released if Uganda’s Attorney General approves the proposal. The prisoner release has been framed as one way to decongest prisons and reduce the spread of coronavirus within the facilities, according to a report on April 7 by Ugandan newspaper the Daily Monitor.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/29/report-uganda-raids-lgbt-shelter-claiming-coronavirus-violations/
['Frances Martel'],2020-04-28,Lawsuit Demands China Pay $200 Billion to Nigeria in Damages,"A group of Nigerian attorneys announced this week they would file a lawsuit against the government of China, seeking $200 billion in damages for its role in exacerbating the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

According to Nigeria’s the Guardian, the law firm Azinge and Azinge is seeking to pressure the government of Nigeria to press charges against the Chinese Communist Party at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at the Hague, as well, to overcome the obstacle of sovereign immunity. Only states, not individuals, can bring matters before the ICJ.

Azinge and Azinge, the law firm organizing the legal action, said in a statement their astronomical estimate of redress for the Nigerian people over the pandemic takes into account “loss of lives, economic strangulation, trauma, hardship, social disorientation, mental torture and disruption of normal daily existence of people in Nigeria.”

“The team of legal experts planned a two-phase line of action: first is with the federal high court of Nigeria and secondly to persuade the government of Federal Republic of Nigeria to institute a state action against the Peoples Republic of China at the International Court of Justice at the Hague,” Epiphany Azinge, one of the lawyers organizing the lawsuit, told reporters this week. “The legal experts will be claiming damages to the tune of 200 billion dollars the Chinese Government will be served through its Embassy in Nigeria.”

Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and its largest oil exporter, suffering prodigious economic damage with the collapse in global oil prices that the pandemic has caused.

At press time, Nigeria has documented 1,337 cases of Chinese coronavirus nationwide and 40 deaths. These numbers are likely significantly deflated, however, given the sparse healthcare infrastructure in much of the country, particularly the poorer northeast. The number also does not include dozens of individuals who have died in rural areas inexplicably of a “strange ailment” but never had the opportunity to test for Chinese coronavirus.

In addition to suffering the medical repercussions of the Chinese virus, Nigerians in China have been the victims of widespread racism. In Guangzhou, a southern Chinese city with one of the largest populations of black people nationwide, Nigerians and other Africans and black people have reported being expelled from their homes despite paying rent and banned from businesses like hotels and restaurants, being forced to sleep on the street while being able to afford shelter. Some have protested that Chinese authorities force them into “quarantine” even after testing negative for Chinese coronavirus repeatedly, while they see non-black foreigners moving about freely.

The Chinese Communist Party has falsely insisted that its current cases of Chinese coronavirus all originated from foreigners, fueling racism. China also claims that the verdict is still out on where the virus originated, despite all the earliest cases of confirmed Chinese coronavirus infection occurred in the central city of Wuhan. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman posited instead that the virus was created in a U.S. Army laboratory, citing no evidence.

American officials are formally investigating the possibility that the Wuhan Institute of Virology played a role in the pandemic, Breitbart News confirmed this week.

The Nigerian government typically enjoys warm relations with China, participating in the nation’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI is a scheme in which China lends developing countries, many of them in Africa, large loans at predatory interest rates to build upscale transportation projects. China then floods the project with Chinese migrant workers, who are paid with the loan money, thus returning it to China. President Muhammadu Buhari also regularly sends warm greetings to China.

Following initial reports of racist acts against black people in Guangzhou, Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama offered a lukewarm statement opposing bigotry. After a continent-wide outcry against China, however, Onyeama issued a much more impassioned statement last week in which he raised the possibility of assessing legal damages caused by behavior the Chinese government allowed against Nigerians.

“We are deeply wounded by what is happening to Nigerians and other Africans living in China, it is something we never expected and we will pursue it,” Onyeama said. “We’ve made it clear to the Chinese government in no uncertain terms, unequivocally, that under no circumstances we will accept racial discrimination against Nigerians and the Africans or blacks in China. That that is a red line for us.”

“I have directed the [Nigerian] consulate in Guangzhou to systematically detail every single case of discrimination and every single case of loss or damage suffered by any Nigerian,” he added. “We will pursue every single one very robustly with the Chinese government if it requires compensation and damages.”

Nigeria joins Italy, Egypt, and two U.S. states – Missouri and Mississippi – in accepting lawsuits against the government of China for its role in the pandemic. China has largely responded to the American lawsuits with insults and threats.

“The US has in the past acted as a hooligan in the political and public opinion spheres, and the hooliganism has now expanded into the judicial realm. Hooligans are cheats who willingly break the rules when they can’t win. The US acts are a good example of this,” the Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, asserted last week.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-28,Nigeria: Boko Haram Makes Millions Selling Smoked Fish and Red Pepper,"Jihadist terrorist group Boko Haram in 2009 kicked off an insurgency in Nigeria that spilled into neighboring countries to the east and persists to this day.

According to an analysis published by Nigerian newspaper Premium Times on Sunday, two of the major economic activities disrupted by the insurgency – commercial fishing and farming of red pepper – have been co-opted by Boko Haram in recent years and used to fuel its current resurgence in the vast Lake Chad region linking Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon.

Fish and red pepper were central trading products in the Lake Chad Basin economy before the crisis, and many area communities depended upon them as both a source of food and revenue. Prior to Boko Haram’s rise, the combined fish and red pepper trades contributed $48 million to Nigeria’s economy, and employed over 300,000 people according to the World Food Program, the report said.

In 2015, the terrorists began to strategically reorganize the trade of both products. They encouraged fishing by the banks of Lake Chad among local communities and created a new economic structure of taxes, fees, and paid protection for traders along secure routes to reach designated markets, according to the report.

Boko Haram’s leadership sent recruiters to internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Nigeria’s Borno State, requesting the very people they had displaced to return to fishing, farming, and trading, but now under their terms, reported the Premium Times. Several hundred families agreed to resume farming and fishing activities in and around Lake Chad, eager to escape the camps’ desperate and inhumane living conditions.

Borno state, in northeastern Nigeria, was one of the Lake Chad communities most dependent on commercial fishing and red pepper farming prior to the terrorists’ jihadist campaign, according to the analysis, and was also the site where Boko Haram caused the most conflict.

Lake Chad’s aquatic life and natural resources replenished in the years following the insurgency and subsequent halting of fishing and farming in the area. According to the report, Boko Haram capitalized on this new abundance when recruiting fishermen and farmers from the camps. The jihadist terrorists described the bountiful aquatic life in Lake Chad as a strong indication that Allah was pleased with the war they had been waging and was rewarding them with the “symbolic manna from heaven,” says Premium Times.

In reality, some contend the renewal of aquatic resources in Lake Chad was the result of the drastic reduction of human activity in the region due to population displacement caused by the insurgency.

According to the report, once the area’s agriculture was re-established, Boko Haram began to charge farmers and fishermen a significant tax for their products. It also forced farmers to pay for security provided by Boko Haram on specially designated routes when transporting their goods to markets.

“Most of the revenue from fish is shared between the military that confiscates the goods and the terrorists that charge levies for these items,” said a Borno State government official speaking to the Premium Times on condition of anonymity.

Often, farmers and fisherman pay their taxes to the terrorists not in cash but in the form of essential commodities like gasoline, prescription drugs, mobile phones, cooking stoves, and spices according to the report.

The Premium Times argued that Nigerian government officials allow Boko Haram to continue the illegal fish and red pepper trade in the country unbothered, while Chadian forces have attempted to curtail the operations in their regions.

In recent months, Boko Haram has increased its attacks in the Lake Chad area, taking advantage of lockdowns caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic to stage a resurgence. Last month, the terrorist group carried out two of its most significant attacks to date; since then, it has continued to attack communities left vulnerable due to coronavirus lockdowns in the area, which restrict people’s movement.

Boko Haram massacred at least 92 Chadian soldiers on March 22 when it attacked an army base on Boma Peninsula along the border with Nigeria and Niger. It was the single deadliest attack on Chad’s military forces. The next day, Boko Haram reportedly wiped out an entire Nigerian artillery unit. The militants ambushed and killed at least 50 Nigerian soldiers near northern Nigeria’s Yobe state, in one of the deadliest assaults on Nigerian troops.

Since 2009, Boko Haram has killed roughly 36,000 people and displaced about two million people in northeastern Nigeria, according to United Nations estimates. As seen with the attacks in March, regional authorities have largely failed to combat the jihadist insurgency. Several nations united to create the Multinational Joint Force in 2015, in an attempt to counter jihadist activity in the Lake Chad area.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/28/nigeria-boko-haram-makes-millions-selling-smoked-fish-and-red-pepper/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-25,Lebanon Arrests Suspect for Putting Nigerian Worker Up ‘For Sale’ Online,"Lebanese security forces arrested a man on Thursday on suspicion of putting a Nigerian domestic worker up “for sale” online, Al Jazeera reported.

The man placed the advertisement on a Facebook page popular in Lebanon for the casual trade of items such as furniture, food, and shoes.

“Domestic worker of African citizenship (Nigerian) for sale with a new residency and full legal papers,” a Facebook account under the name Wael Jerro posted on a page entitled “Buy and Sell in Lebanon.” Authorities remain unsure of the post’s exact date.

On Thursday, members of Lebanon’s General Security, the country’s leading intelligence agency that controls entry and exit from the Mediterranean country, arrested a suspect. The agency told Al Jazeera on Thursday that an investigation into the incident is currently underway.

On Wednesday, Lebanon’s Justice Minister Marie-Claude Najem had ordered the judiciary to follow up on the case, citing Lebanon’s anti-human trafficking law, according to Al Jazeera. Lebanon’s Ministry of Labor also released a statement saying anyone who advertises domestic workers online would be prosecuted. In her statement on Wednesday, Najem said the case represented a “blatant violation of human dignity.”

Al Jazeera said Nigerian officials have requested that Lebanese authorities investigate the incident.

Approximately 250,000 migrant domestic workers live and work in Lebanon, according to Al Jazeera. Most are from sub-Saharan African countries such as Ethiopia and Ghana, as well as Asian nations like Nepal and the Philippines.

In Lebanon, the country’s kafala system requires workers to obtain their employer’s permission to end a job contract, Al Jazeera reports. The system, which also ties workers’ legal residency to their employers, has led to widespread abuse, including wage withholding, and physical and sexual assault.

Camille Abousleiman, Lebanon’s former labor minister, has called kafala “modern-day slavery.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/04/25/lebanon-arrests-suspect-for-putting-nigerian-worker-up-for-sale-online/
['Ben Kew'],2020-04-24,Cameroon: Police Clash with Muslims Refusing to Cancel Ramadan Gatherings,"Police in Cameroon clashed with Muslims on Friday after they refused to adhere to lockdown measures in response to the Chinese coronavirus to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan, Voice of America (VOA) reports.

In a statement, police said they were forced to disperse Muslims gathering in 13 mosques in the country’s West, Center, and Far North regions, attending Friday prayers to begin the Ramadan fasting period.

Gatherings of more than 50 people are banned under measures imposed by the government this month aimed at containing the spread of the virus. Anyone venturing outside must wear protective face masks. Those not following the rules are subject to fines and sanctions.

Awah Fonka, governor of the western region of Cameroon, said he asked security forces to forcibly remove those ignoring government orders and “not spare anyone” who continues to disobey. According to police, some in the crowd were actively targeting people in some of Cameroon’s hardest-hit towns and villages, with some 175 people complaining that they were targeted or chased from their villages.

Police in Cameroon are not the only authorities struggling to keep some Muslims from practicing their faith at this important time in the Islamic calendar. Most imams have asked people to stay indoors, yet some hardliners have urged their followers to ignore lockdown measures in order to prioritize the observation of Ramadan and other religious practices.

Ramadan, which began on Thursday, requires Muslims to fast and pray at mosques during the daylight hours before holding feasts with family and friends at sundown. The large crowds that ensue create ripe conditions for the virus to spread, and so most governments have ordered people to stay home.

Elsewhere in Africa, Islamist terror organization Boko Haram has taken advantage of the lockdowns by increasing attacks across territories in both Cameroon and Nigeria. This month, the organization killed at least ten people in a suicide bombing in Blama Kamsoulou, a northern village of Cameroon close to the country’s border with Nigeria.

Cameroon remains the West African country hardest hit by the ongoing pandemic, reporting 1,430 cases nationwide and 43 deaths. At least 668 people have already made a full recovery.

['John Hayward'],2020-04-24,Tanzania: President Calls for African Debt Forgiveness After Coronavirus,"President of Tanzania John Magufuli on Wednesday called for international lenders, particularly the World Bank, to forgive existing African loans instead of offering new loans to help rebuild the continent’s economies after the Wuhan virus pandemic.

“African countries’ economic capacity is not the same as that of developed countries. Instead of offering more loans to fight corona, they should forgive debts,” Magufuli said in a televised address to his defense and security chiefs.

Magufuli expressed appreciation for the World Bank’s offer of fast-track financing, but argued that debt forgiveness would be more helpful than asking impoverished nations that suffered economic damage from the coronavirus to take on even more debt, no matter how attractive the terms. He noted that Tanzania spends over $300 million in U.S. dollars on debt repayment and about half of it goes to the World Bank.

“Since the World Bank has shown its concern and willingness to help us out of this pandemic, allow me to request that that help should come in the form of a relief on repayment of existing debts, or at least its interest,” he said.

“I would request, fellow African countries, that our rich brothers should consider a debt relief for us instead of getting us into a new burden of loans for which they will demand interest,” he continued. “It would make economic sense if the loan was reflected in debt relief. That, I think, would be a good gesture for these financial institutions toward poor countries.”

Magufuli also criticized what he saw as fearmongering and political opportunism over the coronavirus and resisted calls to impose a lockdown, instead recommending simple social distancing techniques and local herbal remedies. He described these herbal treatments, including onions, as “important and scientific.”

“Not everyone who gets the coronavirus dies,” he said. “Not everyone who dies, dies of Covid-19. We should fight fear, which is itself a more dangerous thing than Covid-19.”

Tanzania’s official coronavirus count stood on Friday at 284 cases and ten deaths, most of them in the commercial hub of Dar es Salaam. Magufuli said Tanzania cannot afford the economic damage from a quarantine.

“There are calls to lock down Dar es Salaam. We will never do that. This is our main port city and accounts for around 80 percent of government revenue,” he said on Wednesday.

The health and economy of Africa are major concerns for international organizations from the United Nations to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the World Bank, but the latter has been lukewarm at best on Tanzania’s coronavirus program.

AFP noted this week that a spate of stories has appeared in Tanzanian and African media claiming the World Bank praised Magufuli’s administration for its handling of the pandemic, but none of that praise actually appears in any official World Bank document.

The World Bank felt it necessary to release a statement denying that it has offered any “specific mention or assessment of Tanzania’s Covid-19 response.” Instead, the bank’s analysis recommends African nations should “customise their Covid-19 responses to fit the structural features of their economies.”

The World Bank has predicted the coronavirus will knock sub-Saharan Africa from a projected 2.8 percent growth rate for 2020 into an outright recession of between two and five percent, exacerbated by the effect of cratering prices on economies that depend upon oil revenue. Also, the worldwide loss of production and demand for products such as automobiles has reduced demand for the metals sold by African nations.

Of course, persuading lenders to underwrite even low-interest loans with very protracted repayment terms is very different from persuading them to take billions of dollars in losses by writing off existing loans.

African officials told the G-20 meeting in mid-April that short-term debt relief offered by their creditors was not enough to help them through the coronavirus crisis. African Union envoy Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said at least a “two-year time scale” was needed for a moratorium on African debt payments to “give African countries the breathing room to be able to deal with the enormous consequences of the pandemic.”

At least one European official, French President Emmanuel Macron, has called for “massively canceling” some of Africa’s debt. On the other hand, China has been noticeably quiet about the prospect of canceling any of its massive debts in Africa.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/04/24/tanzania-president-calls-african-debt-forgiveness-after-coronavirus/
['Frances Martel'],2020-04-24,"Nigeria ‘Deeply Wounded,’ ‘Extremely Disappointed’ by Chinese Racism","Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, issued scathing remarks against the communist government of China on Thursday, announcing Nigerian diplomats in Guangzhou were instructed to document cases of racism by Chinese against their citizens.

For weeks, videos, local reports, and other evidence have indicated widespread racist attacks and policies by Chinese in Guangzhou, a southern port city that is home to many of China’s African residents. Africans and black people from other parts of the world in the city reported being forcibly evicted despite paying their rents and banned from businesses like hotels and restaurants.

In a particularly embarrassing incident for the American company, a McDonald’s in Guangzhou posted a sign stating it would not allow black-skinned people into the establishment, triggering “diversity and inclusion training” mandated by corporate officers.

Many Africans were reportedly forced to sleep on the streets of Guangzhou, despite having the money to pay for shelter, because no Chinese residence or hotel would take them.

The racism appears to be based on rumors circulated in party by the Communist Party that cases of Chinese coronavirus in its origin country are now coming from “foreigners.” Beijing calls cases of individuals diagnosed with Chinese coronavirus after entering the country from abroad “imported” cases and claims any threat to Chinese nationals comes from these, and not domestic, cases of the virus.

There is no evidence that African people are more likely to be carrying the virus and it is not clear why some in Guangzhou concluded that banning black people from their businesses would protect them from the Chinese coronavirus. Africa is among the continents with the lowest numbers of documented Chinese coronavirus cases.

“We are deeply wounded by what is happening to Nigerians and other Africans living in China, it is something we never expected and we will pursue it,” Onyeama told reporters in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, on Thursday.

“We have an engagement with the Chinese government at various levels. The level of our consulate in Guangzhou, which is where these cases of discrimination and racism have been taking place. and also at the federal level in China, in Beijing,” Onyeama explained, claiming that China was providing “medical assistance” for Nigerian Chinese coronavirus patients.

The foreign minister then appeared to accuse the Chinese government of lying about the racism in Guangzhou.

“We’ve made it clear to the Chinese government in no uncertain terms, unequivocally, that under no circumstances we will accept racial discrimination against Nigerians and the Africans or blacks in China,” Onyeama continued. “That that is a red line for us. They have, in turn, told us that there is no case of that … but clearly, you know, we are seeing videos, have received reports, and we told them it’s unacceptable.”

“I have directed the [Nigerian] consulate in Guangzhou to systematically detail every single case of discrimination and every single case of loss or damage suffered by any Nigerian,” Onyeama announced. “We will pursue every single one very robustly with the Chinese government if it requires compensation and damages.”

Onyeama proclaimed his government “extremely disappointed such a thing could happen.”

That is a red line for us because we showed China real solidarity in not placing a ban on China during the early outbreak of the pandemic in Wuhan. But of course, the Government of China has given us explanations that no such thing will occur any more. — Geoffrey Onyeama (@GeoffreyOnyeama) April 23, 2020

“As the World’s largest black nation, it behoves [sic] us to defend the dignity of blacks and Africans anywhere in the world,” Onyeama added on Twitter.

The foreign minister’s tone differed significantly from his remarks last week, when reports of Nigerians forced out into the street in the middle of a pandemic first surfaced. During a press conference on April 14, Onyeama criticized local Guangzhou officials, and not the Chinese government generally, for not discussing issues with Nigerians in the city with their government. Chinese state television interpreted his remarks as saying there was “no evidence of discrimination.”

In addition to being banned from restaurants for having darker skin than Chinese people, black people in Guangzhou reported government harassment, such as being forced to take many more coronavirus tests than non-black counterparts and being quarantined in their homes even after testing positive.

In a report published by BBC this week, one African in Guangzhou speaking anonymously documented his “arbitrary detention” at home, forced into quarantine despite having no known contact with any Chinese coronavirus patients and no evidence of infection.

“They have to stay here and they can’t stay in a hotel because the hotel doesn’t want them anymore. Some people are living in the streets,” an African man identified by the pseudonym “Leo” told Vice in a report published Friday. “Some people want to go to restaurants, but they can’t buy food because the restaurants tell them, ‘We’re not selling you food because you are Black..'”

Onyeama’s new comments may be a result of growing outrage in Africa at its governments for not doing enough to punish the Chinese government for allowing racist abuse.

“These are serious violations of rights which we, black people are not going to stand by and tolerate,” members of the Africa Diaspora Development Institute (ADDI) wrote in on open letter to dictator Xi Jinping published this week by Nigeria’s Guardian newspaper. “It is in the spirit of fairness and respect for human rights that we urge you in the strongest of terms, to put an immediate end to the harassment, intimidation, and inhumane treatment meted out to African brothers and sisters, sons, and daughters living in your country. The line has been crossed and enough is enough! We demand immediate reciprocity.”

Xi Jinping has made no public comments on the racism in his country.

In Kenya, columnist Makau Mutua wrote at the Daily Nation that his government “has been neutered by the Chinese.”

“The Chinese are bent on exploiting every last natural resource in Africa to feed their hungry and voracious industrial appetite,” Mutua wrote in an April 19 column. “The flip side is the Chinese penetration of the African import market with cheap, often substandard, goods.”

“But Kenyans have also flocked to China for higher education and to source cheap goods for import. While Kenyans in China navigate the country wearily, the Chinese in Kenya strut around the country like colossi, as though they own Kenya,” Mutua noted. “Three recent cases of Chinese racism and intolerable arrogance come to mind. In the first, a Chinese restaurant refused service to blacks. Kenya can’t allow itself to be recolonised. It must take bold steps to repudiate the actions of the Chinese.”

Mutua calls for Kenya to begin its condemnation by “publicly and loudly expelling a good number of Chinese citizens.”

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-24,Coronavirus Oil Price Collapse Threatens Vulnerable African Economies,"Many nations in Africa face potential devastation by the recent collapse of oil prices due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, and reports this week indicate the damage has already begun.

For the first quarter of 2020, trade between Africa and China fell by 14 percent to $41.23 billion, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday.

In the January-March period, China’s imports from Africa, mainly raw materials for industry, such as oil and metals, fell by 17.5 percent in the quarter to $19.8 billion, while Chinese exports to Africa dropped 10.5 percent to $21.4 billion compared to last year, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs.

Oil demand has dropped in recent months due to a disruption in global supply and demand chains caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Economies around the world have been severely hindered by government-mandated lockdowns, designed to slow the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. As nations force their citizens into house arrest and shut down businesses, citizens and large cargo vehicles use less fuel as they make fewer trips.

On Monday, oil prices went negative for the first time ever.

China is the world’s largest oil importer. Oil accounts for more than half of sub-Saharan Africa’s exports, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) reported on Wednesday. According to the Brookings Institute, most of the global poor live in sub-Saharan Africa, meaning countries in this region are uniquely burdened by the oil collapse.

Africa’s largest oil producer, Nigeria, relies upon the commodity almost entirely. In Nigeria, oil accounts for less than ten percent of GDP, but amounts to more than 90 percent of the country’s foreign exchange and can contribute as much as 70 percent of the country’s government revenue, according to CFR. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy.

In recent years, other African countries besides Nigeria – such as Angola and the Republic of Congo – have entered the oil market, causing African governments to become exceedingly reliant upon oil revenue.

Nigeria and the Republic of Congo were among the African countries that reported a decrease in Chinese demand for oil this quarter, according to SCMP. In February, China canceled an oil shipment from Angola due to port closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, forcing the African nation to resell the oil at a discount, Capital Economics, an economic research consultancy, told SCMP.

The two-fold problem of having to respond to the coronavirus pandemic while simultaneously experiencing a severe loss in revenue will likely cripple African nations’ economies in the months and years to come, CFR said. Africa must cope with the healthcare costs of responding to the coronavirus pandemic and also to the humanitarian costs, such as feeding its already starving population. Famine poses a serious threat to Africa in the coming months as the coronavirus pandemic rocks global supply and demand chains, disrupting food supplies.

According to CFR, given these dire conditions, African governments will grow desperate for revenue and foreign exchange, both of which are drying up; they will be forced to find relief from international financial institutions and foreign governments.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/24/coronavirus-oil-price-collapse-threatens-vulnerable-african-economies/
['Ben Kew'],2020-04-24,Founder of Africa's Famous Dancing Pallbearers Speaks,"The founder of a dance troupe in Ghana that has become world-famous for dancing with coffins at funerals said in an interview published Thursday his business caters to the idea that people prefer to say goodbye to their loved ones with joy.

When contacted by the Argentinian media outlet Infobae, John Telewa, a representative for the founder of Pallbearing Dancer Benjamin Aidoo, revealed the group had received dozens of interview requests since video of their performances became a global meme.

The pallbearers gained international recognition in 2017 when they were filmed doing flamboyant coffin-carrying dances at funerals. Yet since the rising number of deaths caused by the Chinese coronavirus, the meme has come back into fashion as families employ pallbearers to replicate the dance.

In the beginning, Aidoo and his team would wear black and white as a show of respect to the deceased. However, they later decided to lighten things up by designing garments of bright colors to perform in.

“We know that something very horrible is happening all over the world, but we are also proud that our videos help people to have a little fun,” Aidoo said in the interview. “When I was young I wanted to be a doctor. It was my dream, to take care of all my loved ones. But life took me to different places and I ended up working in funeral services. I would have never imagined it.”

“Initially, some members of my team and I worked in a more classic funeral procession service. Although funerals in our country always had a festive atmosphere, this was more solemn. Carry the coffin and little else,” he recalled. “Then one day we decided to make a change. We wanted to end all the solemnity of that ceremony and pay tribute to the cultural origin of our country. The coffin carrying dance was a way of celebrating this person’s life.”

In recent weeks, the footage has surged in popularity.

Last week, police in the Colombian city of Quibdó attempted to promote social distancing and other Chinese coronavirus safety measures by recreating the meme, carrying a coffin through the streets while moving to the rhythm of house music. As the procession took place, other officers instructed the public on how to wash their hands, while one officer holding a megaphone urged people to stay at home and respect the nationwide quarantine.

['Frances Martel'],2020-04-23,Boko Haram 'Expanding into the Void' Created by Coronavirus,"The Christian aid organization Open Doors warned on Wednesday that mounting reports from Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon suggest that the jihadist organization Boko Haram is taking advantage of governments struggling to contain the Chinese coronavirus to expand their violent attacks.

Boko Haram originated in northeastern Borno state, Nigeria, and has for years plagued the region with suicide attacks, kidnappings, village raids, and other acts of terrorism. The Open Doors report follows a string of attacks in late March and early April, and a series of assurances from the Nigerian government that Boko Haram is close to total defeat.

The government of President Muhammadu Buhari first declared victory over Boko Haram in 2015, the year Buhari was elected. More recently, Buhari’s officials have claimed that Boko Haram no longer exists as it did in 2015, but has evolved into the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and that this is the only clear jihadist threat to Borno.

Boko Haram renamed itself “ISWAP” in April 2015.

In past years, jihadist groups such as Boko Haram have escalated their attacks during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which begins on Thursday evening.

“Boko Haram and its splinter groups are opportunistically expanding into the void of governance left when all attention and resources are focused on containing the coronavirus,” David Curry, the CEO of Open Doors, said in a press statement on Wednesday. “We are already seeing the geographic spread of religiously-motivated violent attacks, from Nigeria into Burkina Faso and, most recently, Chad.”

“Boko Haram wants an ISIS-like caliphate and weak regional governments are looking the other way. We can’t remain silent while this persists,” Curry said. “We should consider this a precursor for the eventual spread of targeted attacks against Christians throughout the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa. We’re calling on Christians to mobilize support for those affected, today and in the days to come.”

Curry added in remarks to Breitbart News that Open Doors expects that more violence against Christians in the region is possible in the near future.

“While millions of people peacefully celebrate Ramadan, small factions of extremists perpetuate attacks during this time, due in part to a seasonal increase of religious fervor. Christians especially can be targeted when they do not observe Ramadan rituals,” Curry told Breitbart News. “Based on the recent influx of attacks in Nigeria and neighboring countries, we believe that extremists are taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out attacks while governments are distracted by efforts to contain the Coronavirus.”

“We expect heightened tensions to continue in the coming months, so it’s important for all people of faith to be thoughtful and prayerful for religious minorities who are suffering, today and everyday,” Curry concluded.

Nigeria has, at press time, documented 873 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 28 deaths. As it boasts minimal resources to test individuals, particularly in remote areas, these numbers may be significantly deflated. In Kano, northwest Nigeria, locals have reported as many as 150 unexplained deaths, but no access to tests to confirm if they were coronavirus patients.

Late March saw an escalation of Boko Haram attacks, including a March 22 attack that resulted in the deaths of 92 Chadian soldiers. Another 50 Nigerian soldiers died in an attack the next day.

Throughout early April, Boko Haram conducted at least one suicide bombing in Cameroon – targeting a primary school – and a village raid in northeast Nigeria. Village raids typically feature jihadists burning down the homes of locals, ransacking shops and other businesses, looting, kidnapping young women and girls, and killing the men in the village.

Open Doors cited a partner in the region identified as Suleimani M., who observed, “In the midst of the coronavirus situation, the attacks on Christians have not stopped. Just last week, two villages in northern Nigeria were attacked and people were killed. A number of villages were also attacked in Kaduna. Boko Haram continues to wreak havoc.”

The Council on Foreign Relations noted that audio claiming to be of the head of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, surfaced last week asserting that the Chinese coronavirus does not affect Muslims.

“We pray five times a day, we pray Jummu’a, we sleep with our families, we hug, we shake hands, we are fine, fine fine,” the voice claiming to be Shekau said. “We have anti-virus while you are infected with the coronavirus, we have anti-coronavirus; it is the Allah we worship. We pray, we slash fornicators, we cut hands [chop hands off].”

The question of whether Shekau himself approved of pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, and if he controls most of the jihadists identified with Boko Haram, has been a matter of contention for years. Nigerian officials claim that ISWAP is a splinter group inspired to follow late “caliph” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and that Shekau does not control them.

Nigerian officials have also repeatedly claimed they have killed Shekau, which has not stopped audio allegedly of the Boko Haram leader from surfacing and issuing orders to followers.

Nigerian government and military officials have indicated contrary conditions on the ground in the fight against the jihadist group.

“Major General John Enenche, Coordinator, Defence Media Operations said yesterday that scores of Boko Haram terrorists have been surrendering in the past 48 hours, sensing that doom loomed for them,” Nigeria’s Vanguard newspaper reported on April 18, the day after the Council of Foreign Relations reported on the contents of the alleged Shekau audio. “Their leader, Abubakar Shekau, was said to be making frantic efforts to seek a soft landing as he prepares to surrender, the military said.”

“I think the end of Boko Haram is coming close as Abubakar Shekau has been making overtures through proxies for a soft landing for him to surrender to the Nigerian authorities,” Vanguard reported, citing the quote to “sources … familiar with the goings on.”

On Sunday, Premium Times, another Nigerian newspaper, cited the military as announcing the death of 105 Boko Haram jihadists.

Nigerian military sources told Vanguard on Monday that Boko Haram was so weak that its members were fighting fully armed soldiers by hurling stones at them, a report at odds with the large death tolls of Boko Haram attacks in late March.

The reports did not mention the Shekau video, nor did the sources attempt to explain why the operations were necessary if Boko Haram had been defeated in 2015.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-23,Kenya: Parents Use School Coronavirus Lockdowns for FGM,"Rural communities in Kenya are reportedly taking advantage of school closures due to the coronavirus to perform female genital mutilation (FGM), Reuters reported on Tuesday.

In Kenya, 21 percent of women and girls, aged 15-49, have undergone FGM, according to United Nations data. The procedure requires the partial or total removal of the female genitalia and can cause grave health problems for the entirety of a girl’s lifetime and death.

In 2011, Kenya criminalized FGM with a punishment of three years imprisonment and a $2,000 fine. Nonetheless, Kenyans continue to perform the barbaric procedure; some communities erroneously view the gruesome ritual as necessary for girls’ social acceptance and marriage prospects.

On April 6, Kenya’s president placed some parts of the country on lockdown, limiting people’s movements to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. On March 27, Kenya had enacted a dusk-to-dawn curfew. With the new restrictions on movement, young people are confined to their homes more than usual. In Kenya’s northern Samburu county, schools were closed early on March 16 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, reports of FGM have increased in this county.

In an interview with Reuters published on Tuesday, Bernadette Loloju, chief executive of the semiautonomous government agency Anti-FGM Board, said she had received several reports that girls – specifically girls kept home from school – had been forced to undergo FGM in Samburu.

“We did confirm one girl who was at risk [of FGM] and a case is registered with the police, and her mother has been arrested,” said Loloju, adding that the child was about 12 years old.

“We don’t want to take any chances. We have to be vigilant, which is why we are trying to step up efforts in light of this [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic,” Loloju said.

Authorities have since asked village chiefs and community workers to visit rural communities in Samburu county and report cases where girls may be at risk, according to Loloju.

Last year, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to end FGM in Kenya by 2022. At the time of the announcement, women’s rights groups argued that the goal was unrealistic due to many factors in Kenya, such as remote locations, severe poverty, and a high prevalence rate in certain parts of the country.

The practice occurs throughout Africa. In Egypt, a 12-year-old died in January after an FGM procedure was forced upon her by her parents, who were later arrested.

Two migrants were able to contact a lawyer and start an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights while they were still in the process of crossing the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy, shortly after they had departed from the port of Al Khoms, near Tripoli.

Sudanese migrant Abdel Wahab Mohamed and Ivorian migrant Naseneva Diabj were able to contact Italian lawyer Lucia Gennari who works for the migrant transport NGO Mediterranea-Saving Humans, according to a report published last month.

The testimony of the migrants, according to a report from newspaper Il Giornale published this week, was presented to the court in Strasbourg while they were still at sea and claimed that 47 migrants were aboard the ship, several of them ill.

Whistleblower Who Reported Migrant Transport NGO Smuggler Links Lives in Fear After Death Threats https://t.co/8NstEBqn5A — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 23, 2018

Two complaints were filed over that Easter weekend, one demanding the migrants be given a safe haven in Malta and another listing alleged human rights violations by Malta and Italy.

The migrants aboard the dinghy, including the two who contacted the Italian lawyer, were later recovered by a fishing vessel which took them all back to Libya.

Previously, migrant transport NGOs have denied links to people traffickers in North Africa, while Italian prosecutors have asserted the groups have direct links.

In 2017, Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio released images allegedly showing people traffickers working with the German-based NGO Jugend Rettet and its ship the Iuventa in the search and rescue area off the coast of Libya.

“The evidence is serious. We have evidence of encounters between smugglers who have accompanied illegal immigrants to the ‘Iuventa’, and members of the crew,” Cartosio said at the time.

A year later, a former security staff member for the NGO Save the Children made similar claims and stated the NGOs “filmed and knew everything. They didn’t want any information to come out of the ship without their approval.”

The outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus has largely stopped migrant transport NGO activity in the Mediterranean, with Sea-Eye being one of the few still active.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-22,"Report: Uganda Arresting, Torturing Journalists for Coronavirus Content","Ugandan security forces arrested and allegedly tortured a writer last week and arrested a television news anchor this week in two separate incidents, reportedly for their social media posts related to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Voice of America (VOA) reported on Tuesday.

Author and activist Kakwenza Rukirabashaija appeared in court on April 20, charged with “conducting an act likely to spread a disease,” referring to the Chinese coronavirus. Kakwenza’s lawyer claims “torture marks” were visible on his body after his release from detention.

Police detained TV anchor Samson Kasumba on April 20 and said he was under investigation for “alleged subversive activities.” Kasumba was released on police bond on April 21, according to Uganda’s PML Daily.

A political activist linked to Uganda’s main opposition party, Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), Kakwenza was arrested on April 13 by military police, who raided his home in Iganga, Eastern Uganda, Amnesty International reported on Monday.

After his arrest, Kakwenza was charged with conducting an act likely to spread a disease. Amnesty International said he was also charged with defamation and cyber-related crimes.

On Monday, Kakwenza’s lawyer, Eron Kiiza, told VOA that his client displayed “torture marks” on his body after his release from detention in military barracks.

“They produced him in court … in Iganga and he was remanded up to May 6. They refused him the chance to make his bail application yesterday, and he has some torture marks, especially on his feet,” Kiiza said. “But we are happy that he’s at least [been transferred] from military detention to civil detention.”

Kakwenza is the author of The Greedy Barbarian, widely viewed as a commentary on Uganda’s authoritarian leader, Yoweri Museveni. According to the human rights organization Amnesty International, the book “criticizes the ruling first family of Uganda.”

Kakwenza stood accused of posting a Facebook message on April 6 that allegedly discouraged the public from complying with public health guidelines issued to curb the spread of Chinese coronavirus. He has also been “documenting cases of police killings and brutality during the ongoing Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] lockdown in Uganda,” according to Amnesty International.

In the post, Kakwenza included a picture taken inside a market, showing how people in Iganga were ignoring government guidelines on physical distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. According to VOA, Kakwenza’s message urged Museveni to “be serious” about coronavirus guidelines and said, “If the country plunges into the abyss of famine … never blame coronavirus but yourself and bigoted methods.”

On April 14, Museveni extended Uganda’s 14-day lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus for three more weeks, until May 5. Under the lockdown, public transportation and large gatherings are banned. A nighttime curfew has been enforced, and schools are closed. Only groups of five or less are allowed to be together in public.

In a separate incident, police arrested a Kampala television anchor, Samson Kasumba, on April 20.

“He’s a subject of investigation and it’s not connected in any way to his journalistic work. But he’s being investigated together with others for alleged subversive activities,” police spokesman Fred Enanga reportedly said, without specifying what the “alleged activities” were.

Upon his release on police bond on April 21, Kasumba was interviewed by NBS TV, his employer. Kasumba said police told him that he had been arrested because he “acted seditiously, undermining the authority of the government of the Republic of Uganda” and for “spreading harmful propaganda.”

Over the weekend, Kasuma posted a Facebook message that said that recoveries have surpassed active cases in Uganda. He asked if Uganda was the first country to accomplish this.

VOA reported on Monday that media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders has recorded 65 press freedom violations in sub-Saharan Africa since the pandemic arrived on the continent; African authorities in multiple countries have been cracking down on journalists who question the government’s official narrative on the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Ugandan officials arrested a pastor for claiming coronavirus “does not exist in Africa.” Authorities also arrested almost 30 people for violating the country’s current coronavirus ban on large gatherings when they met for church services.

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-04-22,Islamists Severely Beat Christian Woman with Sticks in Eastern Uganda,"Islamic radicals severely beat 23-year-old Lydia Nabirye in Eastern Uganda, after the woman shared her Christian faith with a Muslim woman who subsequently converted to Christianity.

Morning Star News reported Monday both Ms. Nabirye and the young woman who converted from Islam to Christianity received beatings. The Christian convert, who is pregnant and preferred to remain anonymous, sustained serious injuries as a result of the assault.

Nabirye, the daughter of a Church of God evangelist, offered refuge to the young convert in her home after Muslim family members of the woman threatened her. Six other former Muslims are also staying with her after receiving similar threats.

“Her mother knows that her daughter is with me, because we have been close friends with her for more than four years,” Nabirye told Morning Star News by phone. “The family knows about our relationship with her.”

The beating of Ms. Nabirye occurred on April 7 when she went to console another former Muslim who was mourning the loss of a son who had died and Muslims saw her entering the property. Nabirye was attacked by a band of radical Muslims while she was walking back to her village.

“They held me and started beating me up,” Nabirye said. “They slapped me, and others hit me with sticks, saying that they were out to kill me because I was changing Muslims to become Christians.”

One witness to the assault said that the Muslims ambushed, strangled, and severely beat Nabirye. Neighbors called the police when they heard the woman screaming and the attackers fled the scene when police arrived, he said.

“When I met her at her home on April 14, she was still in pain from multiple injuries – head, right eye and left hand injuries,” the witness told Morning Star News, adding that Nabirye’s father is fearful of a possible attack since Muslims from a nearby village have sworn to do him harm.

Although Uganda’s constitution provides for religious freedom, including the right to proselytize, in practice Christian evangelization is very dangerous since converts often suffer retribution from their families and the Muslim community.

Although Uganda has a large Christian population, the eastern part of the country has a significant Muslim component and it is there where much of the persecution of Christians takes place, especially in the case of converts to Christianity. Christians in eastern Uganda are among those who face the most serious dangers in the world, according to World Watch Monitor, a group that tracks the global persecution of Christians.

During the 1970s, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin made Uganda a member of the Organization of Islamic Countries and begin to Islamize the nation; many of Amin’s policies continue to influence the country today.

Some Arab nations have invested substantial sums into furthering Muslim interests within Uganda and the influence of radical Islam has reportedly grown by more than 7 percent in the last three years.

Uganda’s parliament, for instance, recently passed Sharia banking, which gives zero-interest loans to Islamic projects.

The Christian persecution watchdog group Voice of the Martyrs (VOM) has designated Uganda as a “hostile area” for Christians, a term describing a situation where governments may attempt to provide protection for the Christian population but Christians are still routinely persecuted by family, friends, neighbors, or political groups.

Nigeria has failed to confirm if the ailment was the Chinese coronavirus.

The group was so large that the bodies were buried across three cemeteries. On Tuesday, undertakers who also served as gravediggers in the affected cemeteries told the Daily Trust that they had received an unprecedented number of corpses in recent days.

“This is worrisome, we are becoming overwhelmed by what we are seeing here these days because, to me, the way people are dying is not ordinary,” said Bashir Mohammed, one of the undertakers at the Dandolo Cemetery in Goron Dutse, located in the Dala area of Kano.

According to the Daily Trust, the undertakers urged the government to investigate the “real cause” of the deaths; on Tuesday, Nigeria’s Ministry of Health said it was investigating the matter.

News of the deaths in Kano has “thrown many residents of the city into palpable fears … as they nurse the suspicion of possible community transmission of the ravaging COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] within the state capital [Abuja],” Daily Trust correspondents reported on Tuesday.

As of Monday, Kano had officially reported 59 coronavirus infections and one death, according to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC). Kano is the second-largest city in Nigeria, with a population of nearly four million people.

The policemen allegedly violated South Africa’s National Disaster Management Regulations, enacted as part of a five-week lockdown announced on March 27 to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus in the country. The officers were also charged with corruption. The arrests occurred over three separate incidents across the country, according to national police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo.

In the first incident on Saturday, five SAPS officers were arrested for allegedly drinking alcohol at a local bar in Phuthaditjhaba in South Africa’s Free State province. Photos of the policemen drinking in the bar, and their subsequent arrest, circulated throughout South African social media over the weekend. Images of the officers being apprehended show some of them lying on the floor, face down, with their hands cuffed behind their backs.

“While the greater majority of SAPS members have been hard at work to flatten the curve of the spread of the Covid-19 virus [Chinese coronavirus], there have been some members disregarding the regulations as well as committing some heinous crimes, thus bringing into disrepute both the SAPS as well as the good work its members are doing,” Naidoo said on Monday, as reported by News24.

The bar’s owner was also arrested on Saturday for violating regulations on the prohibition of the sale of liquor during the lockdown. All liquor was seized and authorities shut down the bar.

“The police officials will be charged with defeating the ends of justice and failing to enforce and adhere to the National Disaster Management Regulations,” Naidoo added.

In the second incident, also on Saturday, six officers connected to police stations in Pretoria, South Africa’s administrative capital, were arrested for stealing more than R30,000 [$1,596] from civilians caught in a roadblock, set up to limit people’s movement during the lockdown.

The officers reportedly first demanded a bribe of R100 [$5] after realizing that the driver of a car and two passengers lacked the required documentation to pass through the checkpoint, according to Naido. The officers allegedly stole the money later, while conducting a search of the vehicle at the roadblock. All six police officers were found in possession of the stolen money and arrested; they are being detained at a local Pretoria police station.

In the third incident, police detained one of their own officers after he allegedly hosted a gathering at the police barracks in Soshanguve, Tshwane, about 18 miles north of Pretoria.

The article, appearing in the Communist Party newspaper the Global Times, appeared to be a response to calls this week for wealthy nations to suspend Africa’s debt payments until the end of the year, as the world faces a possible financial recession due to economic shutdowns caused by the Wuhan coronavirus.

Indebted African countries have been hit especially hard by the current economic slowdown “due to plummeting oil and commodity prices and weaker currencies, which ramp up external debt servicing costs,” according to a Reuters report on Monday. Some African nations may see as many as 20 million jobs lost as a result of the pandemic. On Wednesday, the Group of 20 (G20) economies, including China, the United States, India, and others, offered to suspend Africa’s debt payments until the end of 2020.

However, on Thursday, Ministry of Commerce official Song Wei – identified officially as “deputy director at the Ministry of Commerce’s Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation” – wrote that China should not write off African nations’ debt as international financial institutions have recommended, claiming such measures were “not effective.”

“The whole world is facing mounting pressure on pandemic prevention and consequent economic contraction as the novel [Wuhan] coronavirus ripples across the planet,” Song said. “China, as a creditor of some African countries, has been called upon to offer debt relief which actually is not simple nor effective.”

China is not just a creditor to “some” African countries; it is the single largest creditor to the African continent.

“What China could do to help is bring projects funded by loans back to life and realize sustainable profits, instead of measures as simple as offering write-offs. As always, China is open to talk with debtors on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,” the statement said. “Simply waiving debtors’ obligations as some countries or organizations have called for is not going to be effective as a solution. If any debtors encounter difficulties to pay on time, there may be tailored plans including rescheduling or China increasing funding to help related projects resume operation and return profits.”

African countries already deeply indebted to China through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) face serious economic trouble from the looming recession. Through the BRI, China establishes economically predatory infrastructure projects in developing nations to expand its influence. According to the Center for Global Development (CGD), Niger and Angola are among the African BRI countries likely to encounter future economic difficulties.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified 16 sub-Saharan African countries as either being in debt distress or at high risk from the possible pandemic recession, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on April 3.

African countries have called for $100 billion in bailouts and debt relief to help them cope with the negative effects of the economic shutdown caused by the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, according to SCMP‘s report.

This week, international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for wealthy nations to place a payment moratorium on bilateral debt owed by the world’s poorest countries, among them many African nations.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/18/china-says-no-to-writing-off-africas-belt-and-road-debts/
['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-05,WATCH: Korean Baseball Returns with Socially Distant First Pitch,"Baseball has returned to South Korea, but it certainly did not start in a way that anyone would recognize.

The first day of baseball in the Korean league began with a tradition that most Americans would recognize, the first pitch. Though, that’s where the similarities would end, as the kid selected to make the first pitch walked to home plate in a bubble.

Watch:

Nice of the hitter to take a mock swing at the kid in the bubble just before he got to home plate.

The scene would have seemed odd at any other point in world history, but not so much in our current pandemic predicament. Of course, people will take sports in any form from any country nowadays. ESPN is broadcasting six Korean baseball league games a week after the Scott Van Pelt Show, just to give American fans some much needed sports relief.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-05,"U.S. Women’s Soccer Stars Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan Vow to Keeping Fighting After Equal Pay Lawsuit Tossed","U.S. women’s soccer stars Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan have vowed to fight on after a lawsuit alleging unequal pay was tossed out by a federal judge.

Last week, U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner tossed out the U.S. Women’s National Team’s claim that they have been discriminated against with how much they are paid compared to the U.S. men’s team. Judge Klausner, though, did allow other aspects of the lawsuit to go forward to trial.

Still, the USWNT’s biggest personalities, Rapinoe and Morgan, are vowing to continue their crusade.

“This decision was out of left field for us,” Morgan told the hosts of Good Morning America on Monday. “We are fighters and we will continue to fight together for this.”

The court didn’t merely cancel the equal pay part of the players’ lawsuit. In his decision, Judge Klausner actually refuted the women’s charge.

“The WNT [Women’s National Team] has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT [Men’s National Team] over the class period,” Klausner wrote in his decision.

Rapinoe, though, slammed the determination.

“If I earn one dollar every time I play, and a man earns three dollars, just because I win ten games, and he only wins three games — and so I make 10 dollars, and he made nine dollars — I’m not sure how that’s me making more money,” Rapinoe said according to ESPN.

Despite the court’s decision, the U.S. Men’s National Team Players Association reiterated support for the women players.

“The USMNT players continue to stand with the WNT players in their efforts to secure equal pay,” the group said on Monday.

“For a year and a half the USMNT players have made proposals to the Federation that would achieve equal pay for the USMNT and USWNT players,” the group concluded.

[],2020-05-05,WATCH: Djokovic Appears to Break Confinement Rules in Spain,"MADRID (AP) — Novak Djokovic apparently broke confinement rules in Spain by going back to a tennis court on Monday.

Djokovic posted a video on Instagram showing him exchanging shots with another man at a tennis club in the coastal city of Marbella, where the Serb has reportedly stayed.

Djokovic filmed the video while hitting shots and wrote he was “so happy to play on clay .. well, just for a bit with my phone in the hands.”

Spain on Monday loosened some of the lockdown measures that had been in place since mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, allowing professional athletes to return to practice. But sports facilities are supposed to remain closed at least until next week in most parts of the country, with the exception of training centers for teams in professional leagues in sports such as soccer.

The Spanish tennis federation said in a statement on Monday that professional players in Spain were allowed to exercize by themselves or with a coach, but not yet on a tennis court. It said it would work on a set of guidelines to inform players and clubs about what they would be permitted to do beginning next week.

The federation’s statement did not appear to be related to Djokovic’s appearance on the court in Marbella.

Requests for comment made to the federation and to Djokovic’s staff late on Monday were not immediately answered.

It was not clear if Djokovic, the reigning AustraliA would be subjected to fines or sanctions if it was confirmed he broke the lockdown rules.

The No. 1-ranked Djokovic recently said he was against taking an anti-coronavirus vaccination if it became mandatory to travel once the pandemic subsides, though he later said he was open to changing his mind.

Spain was one of the hardest hit countries by the pandemic but it started loosening some of its restrictions on movement as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 started to go down in recent weeks.

World No. 1 ranked pro Rory McIlroy will join one-time U.S. Open winner Dustin Johnson to face off against second place 2018 Masters Tournament player Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff the latter of whom only just turned pro in 2019. The four will tee off for the TaylorMade Driving Relief charity match, Golfweek reported.

The match will be held at Seminole Golf Club, a Donald Ross layout in Juno Beach, Florida.

“I’m pretty excited to do a small part to raise some money and raise some awareness in these challenging times,” McIlroy said Monday on The Today Show.

“When I heard about this event, I couldn’t get involved fast enough,” Fowler added. “I know how much I’ve missed sports and golf, especially, so to be one of the first events returning to television is very exciting.”

UnitedHealth Group and Farmers Insurance are also jumping in to help sponsor the event.

“I think golf can return to doing things like this,” McIlroy said on Monday. “We can keep ourselves socially distant, keep ourselves in different carts, and stay obviously more than 6 feet away from one another, and that’s really important too, so, taking all the necessary precautions to put this match on.

“It’s been difficult to witness what so many are enduring over the last several weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic…I hope we can provide some respite and entertainment for those tuning in across the globe,” the top pro added in a press release.

This will be the first new pro golf that has hit televisions since the COVID-19 scare shut down sports across the world on March 12. The PGA has announced that it will resume play on June 11 with the PGA’s Charles Schwab Challenge.

The survey, known as the ESPN Coronavirus Lockdown Fan Study, sought input form 1,004 adult sports fans. According to the results, 65% of fans approved of a return to sports even if it meant fans could not attend. A larger majority, 76%, said they would approve of a return to sports without fans coupled with players being kept in hotels and closely monitored.

According to ESPN:

Whenever sports do return, 88% of study participants who consider themselves avid sports fans said they plan to watch as much sports as they can. The ESPN Coronavirus Lockdown Fan Study was conducted nationwide April 17-20 with subsequent waves scheduled over the next few months to monitor and track any important shifts in fan sentiment

Games without fans has been a common theme across all sports leagues, as reports emerge about plans to return. In addition, several leagues, most notably the NBA, are working out ways of keeping players in “bubbles.” The primary purpose of which would be to regulate player movement and access from the public. Having players in designated areas would also make testing much easier.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-04,WATCH: Police Smash Former Raiders RB Darren McFadden’s Windows During Arrest Attempt,"Intense video has been released, showing Dallas police officers arresting former Cowboys and Raiders running back Darren McFadden.

In the video obtained by TMZ Sports, police discovered McFadden asleep with his vehicle still running outside a restaurant in McKinney, Texas, in January of last year.

Officers began tapping on the window and rocking the SUV to wake the former player from his slumber.

But as the officers were attempting to rouse McFadden, his foot reportedly slipped off the car’s brakes, and the vehicle rolled into the Whataburger location. From there, things immediately escalated.

Officers smashed the windows of the vehicle and began trying to pull the two-time Heisman Trophy runner up out of the car, but he began resisting the officers.

The video shows a chaotic scene as officer tried to arrest the resisting, allegedly drunken former player.

Officials charged McFadden, 32, with resisting arrest and a DWI with a BAC of greater than or equal to .15. Later, in February, he reached a plea deal, allowing the arrest to be dropped in exchange for a guilty plea to the DWI. McFadden was then sentenced him to four days in jail, with one day served, and suspended his driver’s license for 90 days.

McFadden was a No. 4 overall pick for the Oakland Raiders in 2008, played with them for seven years, and the finished his NFL career with a three-year stint with the Dallas Cowboys. During his ten-year career, he rushed for 5,421 yards and made 28 touchdowns.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-04,"Michael Jordan: ‘I Was a Basketball Player, Not a Politician’","NBA GOAT Michael Jordan reiterated his stance that he never wanted to speak about politics when he was a player and that his “Republicans buy sneakers” line was “said in jest.”

Appearing on ESPN’s The Last Dance on Sunday, Jordan said that he generally wanted to stay away from taking political stances when he was the NBA’s most notable player. He also said that he did not want to be a role model. He just wanted to play basketball, ESPN noted.

Jordan’s attitude was famously summed up in a line he delivered during the 1990 U.S. Senate race in North Carolina when calls were made for the NBA star to campaign for Harvey Gantt in his 1990 race against Senator Jesse Helms.

During the campaign, Jordan was heard saying, “Republicans buy sneakers, too,” in response to questions of why he would not rise up to oppose Helms. He was attacked by left-wing activists as “cowardly” and was said to somehow support the “deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement” because he would not campaign for Gantt.

But Jordan is again insisting that the “sneakers” comment was an off-the-cuff comment made in jest.

“I don’t think that statement needs to be corrected because I said it in jest on a bus with Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen,” Jordan said on the ESPN show. “It was thrown off the cuff. My mother asked to do a PSA for Harvey Gantt, and I said, ‘Look, Mom, I’m not speaking out of pocket about someone that I don’t know. But I will send a contribution to support him.’ Which is what I did.”

Jordan added that he thinks highly of Muhammad Ali’s activism, but it wasn’t for him. “But I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player,” he said.

“I wasn’t a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That’s where my energy was,” Jordan added.

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-04,Legendary NFL Coach Don Shula Dead at 90,"The NFL’s all-time winningest coach, Don Shula, has passed away at the age of 90.

The Dolphins released a statement Monday morning lauding Shula’s legacy and expressing their sorrow at his passing.

“Don Shula was the patriarch of the Miami Dolphins for 50 years,” the team said. “He brought the winning edge to our franchise and put the Dolphins and the city of Miami on the national sports scene. Our deepest thoughts and prayers go out to Mary Anne along with his children, Dave, Donna, Sharon, Anne and Mike.”

According to Pro Football Talk:

A ninth-round pick out of John Carroll in 1951, Shula played defensive back for the Browns, Colts, and Washington through 1957. He returned to the NFL in 1960, as the Lions’ defensive coordinator. Three seasons later, the Colts hired Shula to serve as head coach. After the 1969 season, Shula signed to coach the Dolphins, with Miami giving up a first-round pick after the Colts charged Miami with tampering. It was nevertheless a great investment; the Dolphins went to the Super Bowl to cap the 1971 season (losing to the Cowboys), crafted the NFL’s only 17-0 season in 1972, and won another Super Bowl the next year.

Shula remained the Dolphins coach through the 1995 season, opting to retire after refusing to make sweeping changes to his coaching staff following a blowout loss to the Buffalo Bills. His 328 regular season wins are still an all-time best, Shula also had 19 postseason victories.

['Kevin Scholla'],2020-05-04,They Were the North: NHL Could Use a Quebec Nordiques Return,"Much like the Mets in New York and the White Sox in Chicago, the Quebec Nordiques were always the red-headed stepchild in their own home.

The mighty Yankees of the Bronx and the Teflon Cubs of the North Side, always seem to have the upper hand on their crosstown rivals. For the Nordiques, things were even worse. At least the Mets have won a couple of titles and for a good chunk of the 1980s, the Amazins were the talk of the Big Apple. The White Sox have just as many World Series championships as the Cubs even though Wrigley seems to attract more crowds. As for the Nordiques, the differences between them and the club they shared a province with, were much starker. The Nordiques of Quebec City never reached the Stanley Cup Finals in their history.

Meantime, the Montreal Canadiens have won the most Stanley Cups all-time. Despite that disparity, the Nordiques, like the Mets and White Sox, were a worthy thorn in their formidable foe’s side. A thorn that just wouldn’t go away. Until they literally had to go away.

The Quebec Nordiques skated from 1972-1979 in the WHA before entering the NHL. They would play on hockey’s biggest stage through the 1994-95 season. The Nords were loved by the fans at the Colisee de Quebec, where the franchise played all of their home games, and by countless fans throughout Quebec City. Then one day, they were gone.

Owner Marcel Aubut sold the Nordiques to COMSAT in 1995. The team was relocated to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. Aubut blamed Canada’s exchange rate and Quebec City’s overwhelming French-speaking population. Fans didn’t buy it. Aubut needed a police escort to get out of Dodge.

The cruelest blow came the following season. Colorado won the Stanley Cup. The team now known as the Avalanche won it all. This could have been the Nordiques. The Baltimore Ravens turned a similar trick in the NFL in 2000, but they were already in Maryland for five seasons. The old Browns fans were smarting for sure, but almost all of the players from the 1995 Cleveland squad had moved on before Baltimore won the Lombardi Trophy. That was not the case for Quebec fans. The Avs were chock full or Nordiques. Big-time players like Peter Forsberg, Adam Deadmarsh, Valeri Kamensky, and even Captain Joe Sakic were in Quebec City one moment and Denver the next. Men who were wearing the Quebec powder blue just months prior were now celebrating a championship in burgundy. The Avalanche added a second Cup in 2001. Colorado’s Rocky Mountain high was the lowest of lows for Quebec City. It didn’t seem right. It still doesn’t, a quarter-century later. After all of Art Modell’s transgressions, at least the Browns are back in Cleveland. Quebec City has not been as fortunate.

So why are the Nordiques seemingly gone for good? Who’s keeping the NHL out of Quebec City? The team drew very well during their time in the NHL. Fans packed the arena nightly to back their beloved team. They didn’t sell out all the time, but they sold out a lot. They were close to capacity often. Been to a Florida Panthers game in recent years? How about the Arizona Coyotes? Plenty, and I mean plenty, of seats are available. Even some teams with rich history struggle to bring in spectators. The four-time Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders ranked second to last in NHL attendance this season. The Nordiques would usually fall in the middle of the pack when it came to attendance numbers, maintaining their fanbase year in and year out. Quebec would often outdraw NHL stalwarts, like the Boston Bruins. Surely, fans like that would have a shot at bringing a team back to town, right?

Wrong. At least so far that’s been the resounding answer. Since the Nordiques left for Colorado, the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix (now Arizona) Coyotes, the Hartford Whalers changed to the Carolina Hurricanes, the Nashville Predators came on board, as did the Atlanta Thrashers, Columbus Blue Jackets, and Minnesota Wild. Then the Thrashers left Georgia for Winnipeg to become the new Jets, the Golden Knights landed in Las Vegas, and in 2018, Seattle was granted a franchise that is expected to start play in the 2021-22 season. That’s a lot of shuffling without any consideration for the great people and fans of Quebec City.

If NHL commissioner Gary Bettman doesn’t want to grant Quebec an outright expansion club, perhaps there are other ways to get the Nordiques back where they belong. The Ottawa Senators have the worst attendance in all of hockey. The Sens actually look up at the Isles, Panthers, and Coyotes. The team would surely draw better in Quebec. The current pandemic isn’t helping many franchises. When the NHL finally returns, some organizations that are already doing poorly may even do worse. Tough economic times could lead to another team or two looking for a new home. Quebec has one ready. It’s a state of the art place, too.

in 2015, the Videotron Centre opened its doors. The huge venue that cost $370 million in public funding was built with the idea of wooing NHL action back to “la capitale nationale”. Instead the 18,259 seat rink is home to the Quebec Remparts of the QMJHL and has served as host to some concerts and other shows. The largest public investment in city history could not get Bettman and friends moving.

The exchange rate is a real thing. Bettman has touched on this publicly, and he is not wrong. That said, a team with passionate fans like the Nordiques would surely be able to overcome that gap at the gate. Bettman wants to go to places the NHL hasn’t been before, thus Vegas. But, the Nordiques are special. Quebec is special. This would hardly be any grand experiment. We know what we would get and it would be great.

Bettman isn’t the only nemesis to Nords fans. Many believe their old on-ice foes may be playing a role in keeping them from returning to the ice as well. The Canadiens-Nordiques ferocious rivalry would instantly pick up again. That would be good for the Habs and the entire league. Surely, Montreal isn’t afraid of the Nords, right? Well, maybe not the team itself, but what about the owner?

Geoff Molson and his family probably aren’t too keen on sharing any fans with the Nordiques or anyone else for that matter. The Molson hate for the Nordiques goes way back and it’s not just about hockey. When the rivalry between the two clubs was at a fever pitch, the Canadiens and Nordiques were both owned by breweries. Molson for the Habs and O’Keefe for the Nords. Liquor stores would either hang the Molson calendar or the O’Keefe calendar, certainly not both. You were on one side or the other. Ultimately, just like on the ice, the Canadiens won out in the suds game, too. O’Keefe was sold in 1987 before merging with Molson in 1989.

The Nordiques never did back down from the big, bad, beer-bolstered Habs though. In 1984, the second-round playoff game now known as the ‘Good Friday Massacre’ took place. The contest was riddled with several brawls and plenty of blood. Montreal won the game 5-3 to clinch the series 4-2 and send Quebec home, but it was the wild fighting that made this a notable night in hockey history. Eleven players were ejected and 252 penalty minutes were doled out. Imagine that today? A real, bitter hockey rivalry. Not one between pundits, fantasy fans, or Twitter tough guys, but one between real men, fighting for their team, each other, and a major part of Canada. Who wouldn’t want at least a taste of that again?

The Battle of Quebec mostly went the Canadiens way. Montreal posted a 62-39-12 mark against Quebec. They met in the playoffs five times. The Habs took three of those series including the infamous clash in 1984. The 24-time Stanley Cup champion Canadiens came out on top more times than not, but it was never easy against those feisty Nords.

“The games between the Nordiques and Habs were once the biggest rivalry,” Richard Zemlak told Breitbart Sports. The former Nordique tough guy is positive that Quebec City yearns for another shot at Montreal. “Fans would love to rekindle their emotions to see the two teams lace them up again,” Zemlak said.

Zemlak has only fond memories of his playing days in Quebec. “The adrenaline and excitement and being fully alert for each game is what I remember most,” he said. “The intensity and emotions from start to finish were unbelievable.”

Quebec City is that kind of hockey hotbed. Nordiques fans created an electric atmosphere and players thrived off of it. “Wearing the jersey with that emblem was all about pride to represent the people of Quebec City,” said Zemlak. “We wanted to give them something to cheer about.” Cheer they did. They would love to cheer again.

The Quebec Nordiques haven’t played a hockey game since losing to the New York Rangers in the playoffs on May 16, 1995 at Madison Square Garden. That’s a long time ago. Yet, Nordiques fans are still passionate about their team. In some ways, more than ever. Web sites and social media pages calling on the NHL to bring back the Nordiques, are all over the Internet. Fans outside of Quebec City and even fans outside of Canada are joining the battle. Many American fans want the Nordiques back. Hockey fans want the Nordiques back. Most of all, Quebec City wants their Nordiques back. After all, it’s where they belong. The facility is ready. The fans have been ready. If only the powers that be had half the guts as those old, tough as nails Quebec teams had. Those teams that are remembered so fondly by so many.

Though fleeting, there is still a glimmer of hope that there may be something more than just memories, somewhere down the road, for the ever so loyal Quebec City faithful. The fans whose battle cry has changed over the years from ‘Go Nordiques Go’ to ‘Come Back Nordiques, Please Come Back’ certainly deserve better than this.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-03,Mark Cuban Slams Feds for Not ‘Hiring Unemployed’ to ‘Fight Coronavirus’,"Dallas Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban jumped to Twitter Sunday to scold the federal government for not hiring any of the millions of unemployed Americans to help track and fight the coronavirus.

In one tweet, the billionaire NBA owner took the federal government to task for allowing people to remain unemployed because the economy has been shut down due to the many stay-at-home orders preventing them from going to work.

“Explain to me why in the midst of 50m people unemployed or underemployed, the gov isn’t hiring and training MILLIONS to do Tracking/Tracing, Caring/Supporting at-risk populations and sanitization work? And now is the time to train/pay stay at home parents/caregivers as well,” he tweeted.

Cuban then asked if anyone was “paying attention” and added a list of names of high-profile members of the media and government.

Still, despite the scolding, Cuban also recently said that once the response to the pandemic is over, “things are going to be OK.”

The Shark Tank star told Fox Business Network’s Making Money with Charles Payne that once the “initial hurdle” of the viral outbreak gets cleared, “things are going to be OK.” He also urged the American people to take advantage of any available government programs to help them get through the crisis.

Cuban also scolded the media for censoring “critical information” and cutting the president’s coronavirus briefings.

“I was watching the press conference [on Monday],” Cuban told SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. “There’s no disputing that there’s a lot of hyperbole and a lot of marketing going on in those briefings, but be that as it may, they got to a point where I think the head of FEMA was starting to present all the different data as it relates to personal protective equipment, and where masks were being delivered, where ventilators were being delivered, where gloves and isolation gowns were being delivered.”

Cuban continued, “To me, that was critical information because I — just as a citizen and knowing people who work on the front lines of healthcare — am concerned [and] I’m terrified for those folks when they go to work.”

Exclaiming, “this is not over yet,” Biden took to Twitter on Saturday after a federal judge threw out the USWNT’s lawsuit claiming they have been paid unequally.

“To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet,” Biden tweeted. “To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.”

To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet. To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding. https://t.co/XK6t9oM94k — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 2, 2020

On Friday, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California Judge R. Gary Klausner excluded the women’s unequal pay charge but allowed several other charges of discrimination — including claims over the use of charter flights — to go forward to trial.

Biden’s pandering to the U.S. women’s soccer team comes amid an avalanche of charges that he sexually harassed as many as eight women from the 1990s up until the time he was serving as Barack Obama’s vice president.

Even as Biden seems to be urging America’s female soccer players to keep fighting for their rights, he has refused to allow researchers, reporters, and prosecutors, to discover whether or not he had been the subject of harassment complaints by reviewing records from his days as a U.S. Senator.

[],2020-05-03,Leaders Chart Path Back to Playing Fields for Amateur Sports,"Doctors, scientists and sports leaders are outlining the path back to playing fields for children in grassroots sports — an exercise that will help inform major organizations on how to get their industries up and running as well amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

From New Zealand to Austria to the northwest corner of Utah, leaders are releasing regulations that have potential to impact everything from workouts at gyms to youth baseball leagues to elite-level training with an eye on the Olympics.

The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee distributed a seven-page set of guidelines of its own this week that called on participants to “self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 twice daily,” as one of several steps in a multilayered return scenario.

“In addition to the logistical challenges of returning to training following COVID- 19, there are also ethical and societal considerations that are beyond the scope of this document,” USOPC chief medical officer Jonathan Finnoff wrote in a nod to the uncharted territory that all sports are trying to negotiate.

The guidelines are being developed as some major pro leagues, including the NBA, target return-to-practice dates, while others, such as Major League Baseball, float ideas about starting or resuming their seasons in upcoming weeks. All these plans need some sort of signoff from health and government authorities, who themselves are looking at models of what sports will look like on a grassroots level — a calculation that has potential to impact decisions all the way up the chain of sports.

All entities are developing their plans with the knowledge that lives are at risk and that a single outbreak among teammates or training partners has the potential to shut down a facility — or derail an entire season.

The guidelines reviewed by The Associated Press had several things in common:

— All returns will begin with individual training or in very small groups.

— Very few spectators, if any, will be allowed. The USOPC also released a 13-page guide about sports event planning that asks, among other questions, “Can the financial risk be mitigated through means such as event insurance, establishing financial impact timelines for cancellation, reschedule the event for a later date, or negotiate a contract that limits negative financial impact?”

— Almost every participant will be subject to temperature checks and some sort of verification that he or she is healthy and hasn’t been in recent contact with anyone who has COVID-19.

— Participants will be grouped in ″bubbles″ — allowed to train with a specific group of people that will not change until restrictions are relaxed further.

— One key facet will be keeping track of it all — a role that private groups such as Utah-based Great Coach are trying to fill by offering apps, blogs and other online solutions that will help monitoring.

“The governors and president can say what they want, but when it comes to kids and amateur sports, the only way it’s going to happen is when parents feel like it’s safe for their kids to play again,” said Great Coach founder Bill Kerig, who estimates 45 million children participate in recreational sports across America.

A few test models are developing in Utah, where health authorities in the Logan area recently put out detailed guidelines of circumstances under which fitness centers can reopen, while organizers around Park City also try to develop scenarios for a return to play.

“The way we approach things is going to be driven by governmental restrictions and the easing of those restrictions down to the county level,” said Luke Bodensteiner, who coordinates youth sports programs as part of Utah’s Olympic Legacy Foundation.

Similar lists of best practices are emerging from points across the globe, all tailored to their specific locales and, in some cases, to specific sports, as well.

The U.S. Tennis Association, for example, released a detailed list of suggestions for grassroots players to return safely to the court. Among them: To avoid possible contamination via tennis balls, players should use their own individually marked set of balls to serve and should use their racket — no hands — to pass the other balls back to their opponents.

New Zealand’s national sports authority released a detailed flowchart last week outlining what sports and recreation would look like under four “alert” levels the country is using to define the stages of return from COVID-19.

Austria’s ski team put out its roadmap back to training, which will involve extensive health checks and individual training followed by work in small groups.

But, as Finnoff wrote in his preamble to the USOPC training guidelines, there are no one-size-fits-all answers to any of these questions.

“As a guideline meant to be used by sports as varied as archery and wrestling in locations as diverse as Minot and New York City … this document cannot be prescriptive,” he said. “Rather, it should spark thoughtful deliberation among athletes, coaches and staff, who will use this information to create their own unique return to training plan that is specific to their situation.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/03/leaders-chart-path-back-to-playing-fields-for-amateur-sports/
[],2020-05-03,WATCH: Secretariat Wins Virtual Kentucky Derby,"Secretariat won a virtual Kentucky Derby against 12 fellow Triple Crown winners, 47 years after the chestnut colt won the real race at Churchill Downs.

The 1 1/4-mile race featuring computer-generated imagery was held Saturday, the same day the 146th Derby had been scheduled until it was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby has been re-set for Sept. 5.

The 13 Triple Crown winners just raced virtually at Churchill Downs, broadcast on NBC and Secretariat, of course won. Still holds record for fastest Derby 47 years later. pic.twitter.com/psrCmiKBsU — Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) May 2, 2020

Secretariat was the 7-2 favorite, although there was no wagering. Instead, fans selecting the winning horse online were entered to win a VIP experience at the Derby this fall. Churchill Downs pledged to match $1 million in fan donations to COVID-19 relief.

The virtual Derby was part of NBC’s three-hour telecast that re-showed portions of the 2015 coverage in which American Pharoah won on his way to becoming racing’s first Triple Crown champion in 37 years.

The show opened with Churchill Downs bugler Steve Buttleman playing “Call to the Post” from the front steps of his Louisville home. It moved to the track, with shots of empty stands, betting windows and the jockeys’ room.

The track’s stable area is set to re-open May 11, with live racing expected to resume May 16.

“It’s weird not being there,” Bob Baffert, who trained American Pharoah, said in an interview from his California home.

Larry Collmus, who calls the Triple Crown races for NBC, provided a live call for the virtual Derby, seeing it unfold for the first time just as he would have been doing on the first Saturday in May.

“That was fun ”calling” Secretariat and the other Triple Crown winners,” he tweeted.

A virtual Seattle Slew, who won the 1977 Triple Crown, led much of the way until being overtaken in the stretch.

Secretariat surged to the lead in deep stretch in the middle of the track. No margins were provided.

The computer imagery failed to capture the dirt from the track that sticks to the horses running in the back, and there was no noise from the usual Derby day crowd of 150,000 or more. The race lacked the cavalry charge to the first turn that is typical of the usual 20-horse Derby field.

Secretariat was a two-time Horse of the Year and swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont, winning the last race by a record 31 lengths, in 1973.

Citation, the 1948 Triple Crown champion, finished second. Seattle Slew was third. Affirmed, the 1978 champion, was fourth, followed by American Pharoah.

NBC showed the real American Pharoah at Ashford Stud, where a flat-screen TV was set up in front of his stall to show the race. Now 8-years-old, he is a successful stallion with a stud fee of $200,000.

Churchill Downs analyzed the historical past performance of each Triple Crown winner and incorporated the opinions of horse racing experts who evaluated each contender’s achievements and put them into historical perspective.

That information, known as the fundamental probabilities, was fed into Inspire Entertainment’s computer models, which determined the final result by using those probabilities along with random number generation. The fundamental probabilities only determined the chances of each horse winning. Those with a higher probability value weren’t necessarily going to win; they just had a greater chance of doing so.

Also in the race were 1946 champion Assault, 1919 champion Sir Barton, 1930 champion Gallant Fox, 1937 champion War Admiral, 1941 champion Whirlaway, 1943 champion Count Fleet, 2018 champion Justify and 1935 champion Omaha.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/03/watch-secretariat-wins-virtual-kentucky-derby/

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-02,State of Play: How and When Sports Leagues Plan to Come Back,"President Trump has been consistent about his desire to see live sports action return to American televisions with or without fans. Dr. Fauci has been less consistent in his optimism, but since everyone is tired of listening to Fauci it’s time to take a look at the various sports leagues and what they’re doing to get back on the playing field.

Let’s start with the good news: NASCAR and the UFC are back:

The UFC actually beat NASCAR to the punch by announcing that they will host a slate of three events starting with UFC 249 in Florida on May 9th. UFC 249 will be a pay-per-view event featuring Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje fighting for the interim lightweight title and the right to face Khabib Nurmagomedov. The card will also feature Bantamweight Champion Henry Cejudo versus Dominick Cruz.

Then, the UFC will hold two Fight Night events on May13th and May 16th.

“All three will take place in an empty VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena and with numerous extra safety protocols in place because of the coronavirus crisis,” according to Yahoo! Sports.

NASCAR will follow quickly on the heels of the UFC when they resume their season May 17th at Darlington. Not only that, Darlington will be just the first of seven races in a 11-day stretch.

“{NASCAR} will hold three races over four days in Darlington before moving to the Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina on May 24, where it will hold four races in four days,” Yahoo! Sports reported.

All UFC and NASCAR events will take place without fans.

College Football:

The good news continues when it comes to the college gridiron. This week, Texas Tech and Texas A&M announced that they will resume classes in the fall with the intention of also playing football. Baylor University made a similar announcement recently as well. At least half a dozen other universities have announced that fall classes will be open.

That’s a huge development for college football considering that most universities had refused to hold athletic events if classes were not in session. To be clear, the universities have not said fans will be allowed to attend games.

The potential snag may come with Big 10 schools like Maryland and Rutgers, which are based in states with severe stay-at-home orders and social distancing restrictions in place. Though, several schools appear to be back on track to re-start.

MLB:

Major League Baseball was the only major sport to have the beginning of its season disrupted by the coronavirus. Given that, much of the talk about getting back to sports has centered around MLB. As Commissioner Manfred has said, he fully “anticipates” a return to baseball at some point this season, he just doesn’t know when that will happen.

There are two proposed plans that seem to be getting the most traction right now: First, a plan that would have the league re-draw divisions to essentially create a regional system with groups of teams playing at one stadium, similar to the NCAA Tournament.

The reported start time for this proposal is around mid-June.

The second proposal may still involve re-drawn divisions and regional play, but this plan has the league starting July 4th.

Proposed regional sites include Arizona, Florida, and Texas. Both plans center around a regular season of roughly 80-120 games, with an expanded postseason that would stretch well into the fall and even, possibly, winter. Of course, keeping the teams in regions would allow the league to conduct regular testing and control player movement much better than they normally would. So, the chatter is positive, in that it shows baseball is likely to return in the next six to eight weeks. However, as with all these discussions, fan attendance is no guarantee.

NBA:

MLB isn’t the only league looking for a way to protect and monitor their players. This week, a proposal which would have the NBA finish the remainder of their season in Disney World started gaining traction. Being able to keep players in a “bubble,” would absolutely allow the league to better test their players and regulate movement.

Not to mention that Disney would have a large incentive to help the NBA finish their season considering that ESPN – owned by Disney – has a massive contract with the league. As it stands, the league is set to re-open practice facilities in states where stay-at-home restrictions have been reduced, on May 8th.

NFL:

The American sports world cannot “be back,” until the NFL is back. The good news there is, the NFL appears to be on-track to open on schedule. Roger Goodell linked the country’s recovery to the league’s resumption of play, stressing how the sport can help the country heal.

“We can help bring our communities together,” Goodell said. “We can provide hope. We can provide a distraction from the everyday issues and show people that there is a future out there and that we’re all going to be part of that.”

In recent weeks one of the league’s most influential owners, the Falcons Arthur Blank, said that he envisions an on-time start for the NFL, just without fans. The NFL still faces the issues the rest of the leagues face when it comes to figuring out testing and regulating player movement. However, given their regularly scheduled September start, Roger Goodell’s league will have more time to figure this out.

For now, it appears the NFL will have a very abbreviated offseason and an on-time start. Though, a lot can change between now and September.

[],2020-05-02,Federal Judge Tosses Women’s Soccer Claim of Unequal Pay,"A federal judge threw out the unequal pay claim by players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team in a surprising loss for the defending World Cup champions but allowed their allegation of discriminatory working conditions to go to trial.

Players led by Alex Morgan sued in March 2019, claiming they have not been paid equally under their collective bargaining agreement to what the men’s national team receives under its labor deal. They asked for more than $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In a 32-page decision Friday, U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner granted in part a motion for partial summary judgment by the U.S. Soccer Federation. He threw out the Equal Pay Act allegations but left intact the Civil Rights Act claims.

“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote.

“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure,” he said.

Klausner left intact claims the USSF discriminated in the money it spent on commercial airfare, hotel accommodations, and medical and training support services.

A trial is scheduled for June 16 in federal court in Los Angeles.

“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the women’s players, said in a statement. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”

Players intend to ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Klausner’s decision, a move that could delay the trial into 2021 or later.

“If you know this team at all you know we have a lot of fight left in us. We knew this wasn’t going to be easy, change never is,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn wrote on Twitter.

While the Americans are the most successful women’s team, with four World Cup titles including the last two, the U.S. men did not even qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The USSF argued the women actually made more than the men both overall and by game average, and the women claimed they should have the same bonus structure as the men.

“Merely comparing what WNT players received under their own CBA with what they would have received under the MNT CBA discounts the value that the team placed on guaranteed benefits they receive under their agreement, which they opted for at the expense of higher performance-based bonuses,” Klausner wrote.

“This issue is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial,” he added.

Klausner also said the women could not go forward with their claim that the USSF discriminated against them by scheduling more games on artificial turf than the men had. He said there was not sufficient evidence to show that decisions on field surface were made for discriminatory reasons.

He rejected the USSF’s argument that the men had a competitive need for charter flights that the women lacked, allowing that part of the suit to go forward. The federation has argued that the men, who have struggled in World Cup qualifying, have more need for charters than the women in order to arrive more rested for their qualifiers.

“This rationale does not fully explain the gross disparity on money spent on airfare and hotels for the teams,” Klausner wrote.

In addition, the USSF has said spending in these areas has been equal since the women’s union agreed to a new labor deal in 2017.

Klausner allowed other claims of discriminatory travel accommodations, such as money spent on hotels and commercial flights, to go to trial along with claims on support services such as medical and training staff. He said the USSF’s lawyers waited until reply briefs to ask for those claims to be thrown out, which meant he did not have to consider them.

Seyfarth Shaw’s summary judgment motion for the USSF included arguments critical of American women’s players. That filing caused an uproar and led to the resignation of USSF president Carlos Cordeiro, who was replaced by Cindy Parlow Cone, a former national team player. Latham & Watkins took over as counsel and filed the reply brief.

Parlow Cone has said she hopes the suit can settle before a trial.

“We look forward to working with the women’s national team to chart a positive path forward to grow the game,” the USSF said in a statement. “We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our women’s national team remains the best in the world.”

Earlier Friday, the women asked that Parlow Cone be included as a trial witness. Their lawyers said although the federation backed off earlier arguments saying women were inferior to their male counterparts in skill and effort, it still planned to contest differences in responsibility.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/02/federal-judge-tosses-womens-soccer-claim-of-unequal-pay/
['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-01,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: ‘America Needs Baseball’,"In a Thursday interview, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he told Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred that, “America Needs Baseball.”

Speaking to a local Louisville, Kentucky, radio station, McConnell noted that he recently spoke to Manfred.

“I called the commissioner of baseball a couple weeks ago and said, ‘America needs baseball. It’s a sign of getting back to normal. Any chance?'” McConnell told the hosts on 93.9 FM sports radio. “As you may have heard, there is discussion about having an abbreviated season beginning around the Fourth of July where teams would either play in their spring training sites in Arizona or Florida or play at home to largely empty stadiums. There’s an active discussion underway to salvage part of baseball season.”

McConnell is far from the only member of the establishment in D.C. to urge baseball’s return.

On Wednesday, the president spoke up for baseball, as well. “I’d like to see the Yankees play at Yankee Stadium,” Trump said at the White House while discussing the process to reopen America.

There has been a raft of reports from insiders offering a growing list of ideas on how to play a 2020 season. Some include having the season played only in warm climate states such as Arizona, Texas, and Florida.

Trump, though, was not fond of the idea.

“I see they have some ideas for baseball that are very different,” he said. “I guess I’m a traditionalist, but I think they’d be able to play at Yankee stadium with obviously smaller crowds and crowds would start to build as things get to be a little bit better.”

The president also said that he feels a stadium practicing social distancing would be odd. “When I look at a baseball game, I want to see people right next to each other; I don’t want to see four seats in between every person,” he said.

Trump also hoped for baseball’s return in comments on April 14 when he said, “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.”

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-01,Report: NBA Urges No Testing for Asymptomatic Players,"The NBA has set a date for league practice facilities to re-open, however, that doesn’t mean they’re ready to start testing their asymptomatic players for the coronavirus.

Sources told ESPN that a memo was circulated league-wide, in which the NBA informed their teams that it would not be “appropriate in the current public health environment,” to test their asymptomatic players.

The league’s sensitivity on the subject stems from the backlash the league received when they began testing players for the virus right after suspending play. Because the league chose to test their players when testing wasn’t available to much of the public, the league was criticized.

According to ESPN:

Teams were instructed to make any decisions on testing any players or staff ‘in consultation with an infectious disease specialist, and in consideration of the patient’s individual circumstances and guidance on testing related to COVID-19 from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and from the local health authority in the team’s market.’ The memo also said the NBA is still looking at opportunities for leaguewide testing capabilities, and anticipates implementing one when team-organized activities resume.

The NBA, like the rest of the sports world, continues trying to navigate the unchartered waters of the coronavirus shut down and attempt to figure out the best course towards resuming play. While no certain date has been set for the leagues return, Commissioner Adam Silver has informed teams that they can begin opening practice facilities on May 8th, but only in locations where shelter-in-place restrictions have been lifted.

[],2020-05-01,"Woman Hit in Face by Ball at Wrigley Sues Cubs, MLB","CHICAGO (AP) — A woman who was struck in the face by a foul ball during a Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field two years ago has filed a lawsuit against the team and Major League Baseball.

In her lawsuit filed this week, Laiah Zuniga, 28, says the ball knocked her unconscious, caused fractures under both of her eyes and caused extensive damage to her teeth. She said it hit her because the stadium hadn’t extended the netting that protects fans from foul balls all the way down the third base line, where she was sitting.

“Major League Baseball and the Cubs were aware that severe injuries from foul balls could happen to its fans sitting in rows near the field because it had happened many times before,” Tracy Brammeier, an attorney at Clifford Law Offices representing Zuniga, said in a statement. ”Just last year the MLB announced that all 30 teams would extend netting, … but it’s too late for Laiah.”

The lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court also notes that the league’s recommendation for how far to extend such netting still leaves fans like Zuniga at risk of serious injury and points out that had the Cubs extended the netting farther, as some other teams have done, Zuniga would not have been injured.

The lawsuit, which seeks more than $50,000 in damages from the Cubs and MLB, is similar to one filed in 2017 by a suburban Chicago man who was blinded in one eye when he was hit by a foul ball at Wrigley. That case is pending.

Major League Baseball has come under fire from critics, including some players, who say the netting should be extended farther to protect fans. Last season in Houston, a foul ball off the bat of Cubs’ player Albert Almora Jr. struck a 2-year-old girl, fracturing her skull.

Professional sports teams have largely been protected from lawsuits by what is called the “baseball rule” that, as anyone who has read the back of a ticket stub knows, states that the ticket-holder assumes the risks and dangers that come with attending a game. That so-called “assumption of risk” has been spelled out on ticket stubs for more than a century.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/01/woman-hit-in-face-by-ball-at-wrigley-sues-cubs-mlb/
['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-01,WATCH: Cop Pulls Gun on Chiefs’ Bashaud Breeland During Arrest,"Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Bashaud Breeland was arrested for resisting a police officer at a South Carolina gas station on Tuesday.

According to photos of the incident, Breeland was at a gas pump at the station when police demanded he exit the vehicle and submit to arrest after a York County Sheriff’s Office deputy claimed he saw the player and two other men smoking pot, TMZ reported.

Breeland, though, resisted the officer, and several times pulled away from them as they attempted to put him in handcuffs. The confrontation escalated to the point where an officer warned Breeland that he would be tased if he did not comply.

Despite the warning, Breeland pulled away again and got into his vehicle. At that point, the officer drew their firearms and demanded that the player exit the vehicle and submit to arrest.

Breeland finally allowed himself to be cuffed, and he was taken to jail without further incident. He was booked on four charges, including resisting arrest and pot charges.

After being released, the 28-year-old 2014 NFL Draftee insisted he was framed in a now-deleted post to social media.

“I really was at a gas pump got approach by two guys police pulled up they throw something my car as police pulled up which the cop saw,” the post reportedly read. “I was the one detained wit charges that really shouldn’t be charged.”

Breland’s attorney also released a statement saying, “At the time of this encounter with law enforcement, Mr. Breeland was leaving a gas station store after making a lawful purchase.”

“Moments after returning to his vehicle,” the attorney continued, “a 2020 Range Rover with valid temporary paper tags, law enforcement officers approached Mr. Breeland and drew their weapons. We look forward to investigating why this level of force was necessary. Bashaud Breeland is innocent unless proven guilty. We look forward to the truth coming forward.”

KC Chiefs head coach Andy Reid says he has seen the video, but for now, has no comment until the incident plays out in the courts.

The Chiefs had re-signed Breeland to a one-year deal. However, it is a low-risk contract meaning the team could part ways with Breeland over his off-field issues.

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-01,Report: Loss of Sports Revenue Due to Coronavirus Could Exceed $12 Billion,"The loss of television and ad revenue from the suspension of sports due to the coronavirus, will end up costing at least $12 billion, according to a recent analysis conducted for ESPN.

Those numbers, however, could become even dramatically worse if the college football and NFL seasons are seriously impacted by the virus.

“As an economist, you stand back, you look at the carnage that’s taking place — dumbfounded, awestruck, mind-numbing,” said Patrick Rishe, who heads-up the sports business program at Washington University. “All of those phrases, they’re all relevant because we just have never seen anything on this scale.”

According to ESPN:

At ESPN’s request, Rishe examined publicly available data to estimate the potential impact of the shutdown on the major pro leagues, the NCAA and youth sports. Emsi, a labor market analytics firm, worked with ESPN to provide estimates on sports-related jobs. In addition, ESPN interviewed economists, public officials, sports executives, concession workers, travel team organizers and others to assess the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on sports at all levels. Rishe’s analysis relies on assumptions that appear more remote with each passing day, such as the ability of Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer to salvage at least half their seasons with fans attending games. The analysis also assumes the NBA and NHL cancel the rest of their regular seasons and the playoffs are staged without fans. And that youth sports resume by July. The numbers include everything from the price of a ticket and a hot dog to the money you spend taking your daughter to an out-of-state soccer tournament. For example, the crisis stands to wipe out more than $3.25 billion that fans would have spent on pro sports. It would erase nearly $371 million in wages — approximately 20 million hours — for ticket takers, beer vendors and other stadium and arena employees. At least $2.2 billion of national TV revenue would be lost, as well as up to $2.4 billion in tourism related to youth sports.

Despite the enormous projected impact of Rishe’s analysis, the $12 billion figure does not account for financial losses from NASCAR, golf, tennis, or gambling. Not to mention losses from recreational sports and activities such as fishing and hunting.

“The stakes for sports become higher if part or all of the NFL and college football seasons are lost,” ESPN reports. “According to Rishe, each NFL regular-season game is worth nearly $24 million in revenue from TV rights alone — a figure larger than the budget for some Hollywood films. Collectively, the 65 college football programs in the Power 5 bring about $4 billion in revenue — money that makes up nearly half of all athletic department budgets.”

On a positive note, with Texas Tech, Texas A&M, and Baylor announcing that their campuses will be open in the fall and that they plan to play football, it looks as if the worst possible scenario will be avoided. Still, loss of ticket revenue if those games can’t be played with fans in attendance will still be significant.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-01,"Texas Tech, A&M, Baylor Unversities Set to Re-Open in Fall, Ready for Football","Baylor, Texas Tech, and Texas A&M universities have announced that they will re-open for classes in the fall and will also resume their sports programs at that time.

As the state of Texas begins loosening its state-wide lockdown, its universities and colleges are ready to resume operations, according to the Hill.

In a Thursday teleconference, Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp noted that the school is preparing to open 11 campuses for the fall semester. That includes the football program, he said, before adding that all due caution for student safety will be observed.

For his part, Texas Tech University President Lawrence Schovanec also told students and faculty to expect a re-opening for the fall semester. He also noted, precautions will be put in place.

“We need to recognize that campus life will be different when we return in the fall,” Schovanec said in a letter released Wednesday to the school. “We are developing several ways to reduce the density of groups in our student facilities, large lecture-based classrooms, and our popular campus areas. These same plans extend to special events, including athletics.”

Lone Star State universities and colleges closed in mid-March as fears over the coronavirus overtook the nation.

Baylor University had already announced its re-opening schedule, and according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the University of Texas will be making its decision known by the end of June, if not before.

Ron DeSantis Welcomes Sports Back to Florida, Fan Attendance Possible in June","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) has announced that he is allowing some sports to re-start their games in the Sunshine State, adding that fans could repopulate the stands within social distancing guidelines as early as June.

DeSantis particularly addressed pro wrestling with an appeal for the league to consider staging Wrestlemania in Florida.

“I helped recruit,” DeSantis said, according to TMZ Sports. “I wanted the wrestling to be filmed in Orlando. I’d like them to do WrestleMania. They were going to do WrestleMania in April. That was hundreds of millions of dollars. I want to keep that good relationship. I want them to invest in Florida.”

The Republican went on noting that UFC 249 is also scheduled to be held in Florida. “There’s not going to be any fans, but I think that’s going to be a good event for people,” he said.

Moving to golf, DeSantis insisted, “I work with Phil Mickelson, so they have what they need for that Tiger Woods match.”

DeSantis also praised the talk coming out of Major League Baseball that games could be held in Florida as part of a one-year realignment of the leagues.

“I think that’s going to be exciting for a lot of people and I just think there are going to be a lot of possibilities. So, let’s just be resourceful and creative,” he said.

Of course, so far, none of these sports have made any concrete plans to re-start their seasons, but DeSantis wants them to know his state is open for business.

He even thinks the fans will be back as soon as June.

“I do think if the trends are good as you get into June-July. I think there is a window to have some fans. You’re not going to have everyone packed in,” he told the media. “But man, in 90-degree weather in the state of Florida … if you’re out there and someone’s 10 feet away from you and you want to watch a ball game or something? You may be able to do that.”

DeSantis did note that his decisions are “going to be driven by the facts, driven by the data.”

['Haris Alic'],2020-04-30,Megan Rapinoe Fails to Mention Tara Reade in Joe Biden Interview,"Former Vice President Joe Biden faced no questions about the recent sexual assault allegation leveled against him while taking part in a discussion on Thursday with Megan Rapinoe, the star player of the National Women’s Soccer League and a prominent female empowerment advocate.

The conversation, which touched on a multitude of topics including the Biden family’s support for pay equity, took place as the former vice president is being pressured to address the accusations brought forth last month by Tara Reade, his onetime Senate staffer. Reade, who initially came forward in the last year to accuse Biden of unwanted touching and sexual harassment, now claims that he pushed her up against a wall, forcibly kissed her, and digitally penetrated her in 1993.

In recent days, the accusation has catapulted to the media’s attention, after video surfaced of Reade’s mother calling into CNN to discuss her daughter’s “problems” with working for a “prominent senator.” Even though Reade’s mother did not discuss the exact “problems” and opted not to name either her daughter or Biden during the call, a number of media outlets took the opportunity presented by the video to call on the former vice president to address the allegation directly.

“Tara Reade deserves to be heard, and voters deserve to hear her,” The Washington Post’s editorial board wrote on Wednesday. “They deserve to hear from Joe Biden, too.”

Despite such calls, the former vice president has refused to speak out, even as his campaign has begun arming surrogates with talking points about the allegations. Ahead of Thursday’s interview, many hoped that Rapinoe, a strong champion of #MeToo movement and LGBTQ equality, would be able to coax a response.

That feeling was summed up by viewers at the start of interview, many of whom took to the comments section of Biden’s Instagram feed to make it known they wanted him to discus Reade. Rapinoe, however, did not take the bait and neither Reade nor her accusation were brought up.

Not even a few minutes into Megan Rapinoe's interview of the Bidens on Instagram and the comment section already has many mentions of Tara Reade. — Brittany Shepherd (@brittanys) April 30, 2020

The decision was surprising given the stance Rapino has taken in the past against elected officials she believed not to be supportive of women. Most notably last year, the soccer player called out Vice President Mike Pence for refusing to meet alone with female colleagues and subordinates unless his wife was present.

“Well, women are afraid to be raped, sexually assaulted, sexually harassed, kept out of jobs, fired from jobs, moved laterally their entire career,” Rapinoe told CNBC in December 2019 when discussing Pence and other men in high positions of power. “Honestly, I call f—–g b——t on that.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/04/30/tara-reade-escapes-mention-during-biden-interview-with-metoo-champion-megan-rapinoe/

The Little League World Series has been held every August since 1947 and has never been canceled. Next year was to be the 75th playing of the tournament; that milestone has been pushed back to 2022.

Keener added that travel restrictions would make it equally impossible to hold qualifying tournaments for international teams and to bring those teams safely to the United States.

[],2020-04-30,NASCAR to Resume Season May 17 with Seven Races in 10 Days,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — NASCAR announced Thursday that it will resume its season without fans starting May 17 at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina with the premier Cup Series racing three more times in a 10-day span.

NASCAR joins the UFC as the first major sports organizations to announce specific return to play plans since the coronavirus pandemic shut down U.S. sports in mid-March.

“NASCAR and its teams are eager and excited to return to racing, and have great respect for the responsibility that comes with a return to competition,” said Steve O’Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer. “NASCAR will return in an environment that will ensure the safety of our competitors, officials and all those in the local community.

NASCAR’s revised schedule goes only through May and has a pair of Wednesday Cup races, fulfilling fans longtime plea for midweek events. The first race is scheduled for Darlington, NASCAR’s oldest superspeedway, followed by a second race at the 70-year-old, egg-shaped oval track three days later.

Charlotte Motor Speedway will then host the Coca-Cola 600 on May 24 to mark 60 consecutive years the longest race on the NASCAR schedule will be held on Memorial Day weekend. The track in Concord, outside NASCAR’s home base of Charlotte, will then host a Wednesday race three days later.

There will also be lower-tier Xfinity and Trucks series races at the two tracks. The North Carolina governor has said the the Charlotte races can be held as long as health conditions in the area do not deteriorate.

“This has been a proactive effort to put our motorsports industry back to work and boost the morale of sports fans around the world, while at the same time keeping the health and safety of all who will be on site the top priority,” said Marcus Smith, president and CEO of Speedway Motorsports. He said “sports fans around the world need this, a return to some sense of normalcy with live sports on TV, and NASCAR is uniquely positioned to deliver it from a competition standpoint.”

NASCAR has set guidelines to safely hold the events using CDC guidelines on social distancing and personal protective equipment. Only essential personnel will be permitted to attend the events, and cloth face masks will be required. The entire venue will be used to maintain distancing in garage stalls and where the haulers are parked.

NASCAR suspended its season March 13 with only four of its 36 scheduled races completed. The stock car series, heavily reliant on television money and sponsor payments, has vowed to complete its full schedule. The revised schedule for now stays at tracks within driving distance of Charlotte-based race teams and in states that have started reopening.

“Darlington is one of the most iconic and historic tracks in the sport and will be a tremendous backdrop when NASCAR returns to racing,” said track President Kerry Tharp, who noted the track will now have three Cup races in one season for the first time in its history.

Darlington is also scheduled to open the playoffs with the Southern 500 on Sept. 6. Because the track now has two additional dates, NASCAR will lose two Cup races from its other properties. The same goes for Speedway Motorsports, which gained one additional race so far and will have to forfeit one at another facility.

Almost all teams began returning to their shops this week with either a reduced initial workforce or in split shifts. Now that NASCAR has told the teams where it will be racing this month, they can start preparing cars suitable for the two tracks.

Although Florida and Texas invited NASCAR to compete in those states without spectators, the sanctioning body is holding off on scheduling events at tracks that require air travel and hotel accommodations.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/04/30/nascar-to-resume-season-may-17-with-seven-races-in-10-days/

“I have to disagree with you sir when you that I’m selfish [for re-opening the salon].” Salon Á la Mode owner Shelly Luther told Judge Eric Moyé during a contempt of court proceeding broadcast on the internet and tweeted by CBSDFW reporter Andrea Lucia, “because feeding my kids is not selfish.”

The judge told Shelley Luther she

could avoid jail time if she apologized, admitted she was wrong, and agreed to close her hair salon until it was allowed to open. This is her response…@CBSDFW pic.twitter.com/1phdNUsLme — Andrea Lucia (@CBS11Andrea) May 5, 2020

Judge Eric Moyé presides over the 14th Civil District Court located in Dallas County. Dallas County issued an order to Luther requiring her to close her business after she opened in defiance of the stay at home Coronavirus lockdown.

Luther told the judge, “I have hairstylists that are going hungry because they’d rather feed their kids. So, sir, if you think the law is more important than kids getting fed then please go ahead with your decision but I am not going to shut the salon.”

Prior to her statement, Judge Moyé said she must see the errors of her ways and “understand that the society cannot function where one’s own belief in a concept of liberty permits you to flaunt your disdain for the rulings of duly elected officials.”

“That you owe an apology to the elected officials who you disrespected by flagrantly ignoring, and in one case defiling, their orders you now know obviously apply to you,” Moyé lectured. “That you understand that the proper way in which an ordered society to engage concerns that you might have had is to hire a lawyer and advocate for change an exception or an amendment to laws that you find offensive.”

Lucia reported that the judge ordered her jailed for seven days and fined $500 for every day the salon remains open. So far, the fine stands at $3,500.

Luther’s attorney said he would appeal the judge’s ruling.

The contempt hearing occurred at about the time Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced that hair salons and gyms could re-open on Friday.

The two vehicles were set on fire and destroyed in the commune of Bouguenais near Nantes at around 1 am on Saturday while they were parked outside a local mail sorting centre.

Police found the letters “ADA” spraypainted nearby, the acronym for the far-left Antifa groups Action Directe Anarchiste which took credit for the destruction on their website, broadcaster franceinfo reports.

Andy Ngo: Media's Selective Lockdown Protest Coverage 'Empowers' Antifa Violence https://t.co/30FaaA2SBu — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020

According to the broadcaster, the group quoted Russian anarchist philosopher Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin, a leading figure in anarchist thought and one of the founders of anarcho-socialism.

Conservative newspaper Valeurs Actuelles published an excerpt of the post which claimed La Poste collaborates with the French state to help expel illegal migrants, “pressures and threatens” its employees to work during the coronavirus pandemic, and criticised La Banque Postale, a banking subsidiary of La Poste.

La Poste, meanwhile, has stated that the destruction of the vehicles will not impact deliveries of mail to locals and said it would be filing a complaint with police.

The violence comes just days after French police arrested two Antifa anarchist extremists who they say were both armed and were plotting to kill police officers.

In neighbouring Germany, Antifa extremists are also thought to have been behind the brutal beating of a camera crew belong to the satirical television programme Heute Show (Today Show) on International Workers’ Day in the German capital of Berlin.

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-05-05,Historian: Controllable Pandemic Now ‘Unnecessary Pandemonium’,"Prof. John Rao of St. John’s University in New York City has come out swinging against the “fraudulent” experts who counseled the shuttering of the world “for the sake of creating an antiseptic, barren, soulless world unfit for human beings to live in.”

In his May 4 message, the Oxford-educated Dr. Rao writes that “a controllable pandemic has been transformed into a totally unnecessary pandemonium,” allowing “a painfully hollow modern society to titillate itself with the ‘feel’ of living through the Bubonic Plague without actually doing so.”

“I do not feel competent to discuss the initial cause of a disease that has affected the entire globe, nor would I in any way wish to minimize the real suffering and loss that this malady has entailed for many people,” Rao acknowledges.

That being said, “the reasoning man does not have to be an expert in a given field to be able to make a competent judgment regarding whether he is dealing with leaders whose advice he should heed or reject as fraudulent,” he notes.

When experts “tell young or otherwise healthy persons that they are in the same condition as the weakest of the elderly or the already ill; when they say that in order to protect itself the vast mass of the population has to abandon its livelihood, the well-being of its country, the cultural life of its civilization, and the tools required for its eternal salvation they must be dismissed for what they actually are: quacks,” he writes.

According to Rao, today we find ourselves “at the mercy of well-educated, possibly well-meaning, but ultimately highly dangerous and arrogant guides of this sort.”

“These Masters of Them That Know are pressing us to destroy everything that we hold dear for the sake of creating an antiseptic, barren, soulless world unfit for human beings to live in — and die in — with dignity,” he contends.

For their part, the media have whipped the world “into a state of mass hysteria and terrorized paralysis” accompanied “by a political establishment that permits the cowed masses to venture forth from their cells only under the condition of donning the current yellow Star of David: the face mask.”

The “apparatchiks of the wretched ‘New Normal’ have popularized a fresh farewell greeting that one encounters everywhere when venturing forth wearing the Mask of Oppression: ‘stay safe.’”

If we retreat into our “castles” it should only be “to steel ourselves spiritually and intellectually to muster the courage needed to contradict the arrogant but confident authorities mandating the ‘New Normal,’” he concludes.

['Victoria Friedman'],2020-05-05,Just 273 out of 18.1m People Entering UK Before Lockdown Quarantined,"The government’s Home Office formally quarantined just 273 people out of the 18.1 million arrivals by air, land, and sea to the UK in the three months leading up to March’s coronavirus lockdown.

The figures show that between January 1st and March 22nd, 2020, a combined 241 people on three evacuation flights from Wuhan — understood to be the origin of the Chinese virus — and 32 individuals flown from Tokyo, after being transferred from the infected Diamond Princess cruise ship, were sent to various quarantining facilities across the country.

The Guardian reports that it understands the Home Office estimates that of the more than 18 million people who entered at that time, tens of thousands had come from high-infection areas without quarantine, testing, or social distancing.

Home secretary Priti Patel has said that the UK’s refusal to shut down the country’s external borders was based on advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). However, Labour MP and member of the Home Affairs Select Committee Stephen Doughty questioned: “On what scientific basis were a handful of flights from Wuhan and one from a Tokyo singled out for extreme attention? But not a single flight from Northern Italy, Spain or the U.S.?”

Mr Doughty added that the fact that arrivals from high-infection areas may have continued to travel around the UK with “little or no adherence to social distancing, and with no checks or protections at the border” was “deeply disturbing”.

“Yet arrivals continue to this day — with no formal quarantine requirements. It is simply staggering,” he added.

While airline passengers are down 99 per cent on this time last year, some 100,000 people a week — 15,000 a day — continue to arrive into the UK without restriction. Passengers have accused airlines like British Airways of still letting too many people on aeroplanes, making social distancing impossible.

Coronavirus: International Flights Continue to Bring 100,000 Unchecked Travellers a Week to Britain https://t.co/k1QQsDfzHy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 17, 2020

Last month, reports suggested that the UK would introduce some kind of two-week ‘stay-at-home’ order for arrivals — a far cry from Singapore’s and Australia’s enforced quarantine, with government-chartered coaches picking up passengers by the plane-load and transporting them to hotels where they are instructed to remain in their rooms for 14 days.

Transport secretary Grant Shapps said this week that the government is considering the self-isolation orders, but only after the UK has got the current wave of coronavirus under control to prevent a second wave. That means that whilst Britons remain in lockdown in their own homes, thousands continue to enter the country without restriction every day.

The chief of Heathrow Airport last month called for the Home Office to conduct mass screenings of all new arrivals. However, procedures like temperature checks can only indicate infection for those that are symptomatic, but it can take between one and 14 days for symptoms of the Chinese virus to manifest.

While more than 100 countries worldwide have imposed some kind of travel restriction, the UK has enacted none, making it “an outlier”, according to Professor Gabriel Scally, the Royal Society of Medicine’s president of epidemiology and public health.

“It is very hard to understand why it persists in having this open borders policy. It is most peculiar,” Prof Scally said in comments reported by the Financial Times last month.

“Travel restriction by itself is of course not going to do the job. But all of these things are additive. It all adds up to beating the virus,” he added.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/05/05/just-273-18-1m-people-entering-uk-before-lockdown-were-quarantined/

Agents assigned to the Javier Vega, Jr. Immigration Checkpoint on U.S. Highway 77 observed a semi-tractor/trailer rig approaching for inspection. During an initial interview, a K-9 agent alerted to an odor near the trailer it is trained to detect, according to Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials. The agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station.

During a physical search of the trailer, agents found 36 bundles of suspected drugs hidden among the cargo. Officials report the drugs tested positive for cocaine and weighed more than 92 pounds. They estimated the value of the cocaine to be $2.9 million.

The agents arrested the driver and seized the drugs. Both were turned over to Drug Enforcement Administration special agents for further investigation and possible prosecution for drug trafficking.

“Even with the spread of the COVID-19 virus, human smugglers continue to try these brazen attempts with zero regard for the lives they endanger nor to the health of the citizens of our great nation,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials said in a written statement. “The U.S. Border Patrol agents of the Rio Grande Valley Sector will continue to safeguard the nation and community against these criminal elements.”

The checkpoint is named after slain Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega, Jr. who was killed by an illegal alien, Breitbart Texas reported.

However, after an intense campaign and support from U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), then Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan later reclassified the murder as a line-of-duty death providing benefits to his family.

['James Delingpole'],2020-05-05,The SAGE Committee Running Britain Is More Corbyn Than Boris,"Finally, the UK government has published the names of the people on the committee running — or should that be ruining? — Britain.

The SAGE committee — it stands for Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies — is responsible for the scientific advice underpinning the interminable lockdown.

It is therefore arguably more powerful than the Cabinet or even the prime minister himself because on its advice everything from the future of the UK economy to the freedoms of the British people currently depend.

How extraordinary, then, that for two months the British should have been kept in the dark about the identities of the people running their lives!

One of the reasons given for the secrecy up till now is that the scientists need to remain anonymous to preserve their safety — perhaps from angry mobs turning up on their doorstep with pitchforks to protest about the lost livelihoods and businesses which are one of the likely consequences of the measures that have been taken by the government on the SAGE committee’s advice.

But surely against that small risk must be set the public’s right to know just which people are responsible for the draconian rules now governing their lives.

We know the names of the Cabinet – and they are accountable for their decisions.

The same ought surely to apply to the SAGE committee’s membership. Otherwise we might feel inclined to believe that the government is treating us like children or – worse – selling us a false prospectus.

One obvious concern is the presence on the committee of Neil Ferguson, author of the dubious Imperial College study that prompted the lockdown.

As has since emerged, Ferguson is the author of several discredited modelling studies going back to 2001 when he was partly responsible for Britain’s bad mishandling of Foot and Mouth which resulted in the needless slaughter of millions of healthy animals.

People with a track record like this hardly deserve the protection of anonymity.

The full list comprises 50 names, plus two participants who have ‘not given permission to be named’. You can fairly safely assume that few if any of those names are sympathetic to notions like small government, liberty, free markets — or conservatism generally. This is partly a function of the left-wing bias which has long since infected most of academe; partly a reflection of the way the administrative state now works.

[In an early version of this piece, I mistakenly conflated an ‘Alternative SAGE committee’ created by the former Chief Scientist David King – and chock full of loony leftists – with the real one. But though King’s alternative committee is undoubtedly more hard-left than the official one, I think we can still safely say that almost no one on the SAGE committee would have voted either for Boris Johnson or for Brexit. It is the Deep State in excelsis]

For example, eight of the names work either for the National Health Service or for Public Health England, both manifestations of the Deep State blob which was co-opted long ago by the left. Certainly, their political sympathies would be a lot more in tune with Jeremy Corbyn than Boris Johnson.

This rather invites the question: what was the point of voting Conservative in the last general election if the end result was for the country to be run by a committee largely comprising Corbynistas, Remainers, and other left-leaning ideologues?

And why isn’t the mainstream media kicking up more of a fuss about this grotesque betrayal of democracy?

I can answer the second question. It’s because the mainstream media — itself riddled with left-wing bias and taking its cue from the BBC — has decided that the real scandal is that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s senior advisor, has been sitting on the SAGE committee and bringing his influence to bear on it.

This seems to me — as indeed it is — a complete non-story. It entirely makes sense for any government to have its advisors sitting on scientific committees: they’re supposed to be scientists, after all, not members of the government — so there needs to be an interface between the two.

A more pertinent question, where Cummings is concerned though is: what the hell are you playing at, Dom?

Cummings, it will be remembered, was the reforming radical who was going to keep Boris Johnson’s administration honest by rolling back the Deep State and finally bringing the sclerotic, incompetent, left-leaning Civil Service into the 21st century.

Instead, it would appear, Cummings has allowed the Deep State to make all the running — to the point where it is now in charge of the country.

This cannot end well for the government, the economy, or the British people. Nor will it.

['Victoria Friedman'],2020-05-05,"UK-U.S. Trade Negotiations Begin, Scots Europhiles Demand Brexit Delay","After Theresa May’s Brexit delays and the coronavirus lockdown, the long-awaited UK-U.S. trade talks began on Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump supported the UK’s vote to leave the EU and from early on in his presidency, pushing for a “massive new trade deal” between his country and the United Kingdom.

While Britons voted to leave the EU on June 23rd, 2016, then-Prime Minister Theresa May did not trigger Article 50 — the legal mechanism for leaving the EU — until March 2017 and then delayed the country’s exit twice. A further delay forced on her successor Boris Johnson pushed Brexit until January 31st, 2020. Before that official exit date, the UK was not allowed to begin formal free trade negotiations with other countries.

Even during the current transition period, the UK may negotiate but cannot activate new trade deals until she is finally out of the EU’s institutions on January 1st, 2021.

Politico reported on Monday that talks between British and American negotiators would begin today, albeit virtually through video conferencing due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss will hold a video call with her American counterpart, Robert Lighthizer, with around 100 negotiators from both sides of the pond listening in.

Ms Truss has said that it was “essential” to strike a good deal with the United States to ease the economic burden caused by the lockdown, with ministers believing that a UK-U.S. deal could provide a £15 billion boost to the British economy.

This first round of talks is expected to last two weeks, with further rounds every six weeks. Both countries hope to lower tariffs on their goods being shipped abroad, with the UK hoping for concessions on cars, ceramics, and foods, to make agreements on financial services and data, and to forge deals beneficial to Britain’s small businesses.

The British also hope to use progress on a U.S. trade deal to put pressure on the EU, which is demanding the UK maintain regulatory alignment with the bloc and the continued surrender of her territorial fishing waters.

Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party’s (SNP) Westminster leader Ian Blackford has become the latest Remainer to call for the transition period, which ends on December 31st, to be extended for another two years because of coronavirus.

In a letter to party leaders and reported by The Herald, Mr Blackford wrote: “The ongoing emergency caused by the Covid-19 virus is, and must remain, the sole focus of our collective efforts, and it is right that all other political agendas are paused as we deal with the priority of saving lives and protecting people’s incomes.

“In that context, I believe now is the right moment to unite as opposition parties in Westminster in seeking a two-year extension to the Brexit transition period.

“That strong, united opposition stance would also send a powerful message to our European friends and partners, who we know are favourable to the logic and sense of this request.”

However, diplomatic sources in the EU speaking to The Times last month said that several European countries admitted that it would not make sense for the UK to extend the transition period. They added that any alleged economic impact of leaving the bloc’s institutions, notably, without a trade deal, would be absorbed by the global financial repercussions caused by the Chinese virus.

The British government has maintained that it will not extend the transition period; doing so would threaten the progress of any future free trade agreements with countries like the U.S., Australia, or New Zealand. Senior minister Michael Gove told the House of Commons on Monday that the path of not extending is “plain prudence”. He warned that to “perpetuate our membership of the European Union-lite through the transition period” would result in having to spend more taxpayers’ money.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/05/05/uk-u-s-trade-negotiations-begin-as-europhiles-demand-brexit-delay/
['David Ng'],2020-05-05,Bette Midler: ‘Trump Is Killing His Own Base’,"Actress Bette Midler is accusing President Donald Trump of killing his voter base of “older white men and women,” adding that the president doesn’t care about the fate of the elderly.

The Beaches star made the allegation despite the fact that President Trump has stated that he wants special care given to senior citizens as states move to re-open their economies in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Bette Mider, who is white and 74, tweeted her bizarre claim late Monday in what appeared to be a reference to President Trump’s efforts to re-start the U.S. economy after many states have successfully seen the number of coronavirus cases flatten in recent days.

“Trump is killing his own base, older white men and women! It is beyond belief. And he doesn’t care!!” Midler said.

Midler omitted the fact that President Trump has emphasized that he wants states to safely re-open businesses and schools, with special attention paid to the well-being of the elderly.

“States are safely coming back. Our Country is starting to OPEN FOR BUSINESS again,” Trump tweeted last month. “Special care is, and always will be, given to our beloved seniors (except me!). Their lives will be better than ever…WE LOVE YOU ALL!”

Along with a growing list of other celebrities, Bette Midler has blamed President Trump for U.S. coroanvirus deaths, claiming last month that the president has “30,000 corpses” on his hands.

“Every single day you cause death, destruction, and untold suffering. Four more years of your incompetence and we won’t have a country left!” Midler tweeted, adding the hashtags #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath and #Loser.

['David Ng'],2020-05-04,Cher Explains Biden Support: ‘Vote for the One Side You Hate Least’,"It’s not exactly a ringing endorsement but pop icon Cher has laid out some reasoning as to why she is voting for Joe Biden: “You have to vote for the one side you hate the least.”

Cher said in an interview with Billboard that she sees Joe Biden as an “honest” man while she continues to vehemently dislike President Donald Trump.

“I like Joe. I’ve known Joe for a long, long, long time,” the Oscar-winning star said. “I had a meeting once with him and I thought, ‘You know what? This is an honest man.’ It was way before he was with Barack Obama. We had a conversation and he was so painfully honest.”

Cher admitted that Biden is a flawed candidate, but she didn’t elaborate.

“You know, everybody’s got faults,” Cher said. “But at least he has a soul and he understands pain. He’s also been a politician for a gazillion years. I think he still has got it or I wouldn’t vote. I’m actually registered as an independent. It means I don’t agree with everybody, but in the final analysis, you have to vote for the one side you hate the least.”

Neither Cher nor Billboard magazine mentioned Tara Reade, the former Senate staffer who has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her nearly thirty years ago. Biden avoided discussing the matter for weeks until last week when he denied the allegation on MSNBC.

As for President Trump, the Hollywood actress-singer said she continues to loath him.

“As much as I dislike Trump — and dislike doesn’t even come anywhere near to what I feel about him — if I thought that he was really interested in people and came up with something to help, I would give him some props, even though I think he would have nothing to do with it. If his administration would start saving lives, I’d back off for awhile.”

Cher also had words of praise for Hillary Clinton and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

“I’ve known Hillary for quite a long time,” the actress said. “She’s smart, inquisitive, always learning and tough as nails. She knows more about government than most presidents. But she’s also kind of a girly girl, too.”

She also praised Ocasio-Cortez’s far-left agenda. “That kind of activism is what’s necessary,” Cher said, but added: “Going left is fine, but it has to be in degrees so that the people who are centrist can think that sounds good or it isn’t so radical. We have to bring everybody along and not drag or pull them along. ”

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-04,Chelsea Handler Promotes NYT for Coronavirus Updates While Blaming GOP for Deaths,"Leftist comedian Chelsea Handler suggested that Republicans are responsible for 3,000 coronavirus-related deaths per day in the United States — despite the Trump White House saying there’s evidence the disease originated in China.

“In the fog of conflicting information the reality is that we are numbing people to basically accept that 3000 people will die every day from June onwards?” tweeted Handler of the Wuhan coronavirus.

The Totally High actress went on to claim that 3,000 people dying each day in America is only “fathomable” because of “Republicans.”

“How is this even fathomable? Republicans,” said Handler. It turns out, Handler was pushing a Times story that’s received wholesale pushback by the White House.

“This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting,” said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere. “This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed.”

Last month, Handler praised coronavirus lockdowns — not because she thinks they stop the spread of the Chinese virus — but because she believes they prevent school shootings, given that lockdowns have caused school closures and remote, off-campus learning.

Handler suggested that it took lockdowns for the United States to be able to go through the month of March without a school shooting since 2002.

“It took all schools to be closed and everyone forced to be inside because of a pandemic, but we finally did it,” she added.

The comedian, however, had failed to acknowledge that March 2020 also experienced more firearm background checks than anytime on record.

Handler has also joined the left-wing media’s attempts to block the public from being able to see parts — or all — of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus briefings by claiming that the media should consider suspending coverage of the daily White House event.

Handler implored the media to ask themselves whether or not they believe it is “responsible,” “ethical,” or safe for news organizations to continue to broadcast the latest updates from the president regarding the deadly Chinese coronavirus.

The Chinese coronavirus — also known as COVID-19 — which originated from Wuhan, China has killed 68,387 people in the United States as of Monday, according to the latest data provided by Johns Hopkins University at the time of publishing.

“He normalized being insane but we will vote Trump and all Republicans out in November,” the The King of Staten Island director said on Monday. “They care more about their power than helping people. None stand up and say the President is inept and that is a dereliction of duty. As a party they are responsible for thousands of deaths.”

Judd Apatow didn’t call President Trump and Republicans murders, but, or course, he hasn’t hesitated to do so like so many other Hollywood leftists.

“I think [the Senate Majority Leader] and all of these politicians should be prosecuted when this is done for the lies which cost thousands of deaths,” Apatow said, responding to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s contention that the Democrats pushed impeachment while President Trump was dealing with the threat of the Chinese coronavirus. “He knows Trump is a con man who lied to everyone to delay bad news and that led to thousands of additional deaths. They are all murderers.”

This from the 40 Year Old Virgin director who has said Trump is both a terrorist and a Nazi.

“He’s a Nazi. He wants no judicial process. He kidnapped children and commits acts of violence for political gain and to support his racist views,” Apatow said in 2018. “He admires violent dictators. Trump is a Nazi. The debate is over. Soon we will have proof he is a Nazi supported by the Russians.”

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-04,‘Suits’ Star Rick Hoffman: Trump Needs a Doctor for the ‘Severely Mentally Sick’,"Suits Star Rick Hoffman says President Donald Trump should see a “doctor who deals with people who are severely mentally sick” after the president took a swipe at MSNBC host Joe Scarborough.

Trump blasted the MSNBC host on Monday writing, “‘Concast’ should open up a long-overdue Florida Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough. I know him, and Crazy Mika well used them beautifully in the last Election, dumped them nicely, and will state on the record that he is ‘nuts’. Besides, bad ratings! #OPENJOECOLDCASE.”

Trump’s tweet was referring to the case of Lori Klausutis, then-Congressman Scarborough’s 28-year-old congressional intern, who was found dead in Scarborough’s Fort Walton Beach, Florida, office back in 2001.

“Listen…I’m worried abt u Sprinkles,” Hoffman said in a tweet that has been deleted. “I’d like u 2 see a doctor who deals w/ ppl who r severely mentally sick. It’s not ur fault Geoffrey. It happens 2 ppl. Vomiting shit out of ur mouth is a chemical imbalance. U wud just take medication, and then hopefully u go back 2 ure life.”

Hoffman’s Twitter feed is filled with tweets supporting government officials such as Andrew Cuomo, not to mention a slew of fawning retweets of videos by foul-mouthed Trump hater Michael Rapaport.

“Trump does something insane. Fox News and silent Republicans cup his balls,” Hoffman said in July 2018. “CNN and weak Democrat Congressman cry the same “I’m Shocked” bullshit every day. Repeat. George Carlin’s prescience was bananas.”
