"['Brian Resnick', 'Apr']",2020-04-02,12 things everyone needs to know about the coronavirus pandemic,"Before December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes the Covid-19 illness — was unknown to science. “A pneumonia of unknown cause” was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, after a slew of cases appeared in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has been detected in more than a million people worldwide, and killed tens of thousands.

This is a pandemic, a global crisis and tragedy on a scale that’s hard to fathom.

There are a lot of new things for the public to learn — about the virus, controlling its spread, social distancing, treating the sick, and how our governments should react to this chaotic situation. It’s like we’ve all been dropped in to study for a test in a class that no one signed up for. It’s confusing and hard to process.

Related 11 questions about the coronavirus economic crisis you were too embarrassed to ask

Here, we’ve tried to distill it into 12 key aspects of this crisis that everyone should understand. That said, we don’t cover everything, and there’s still a lot of uncertainty about some of the most important things on the list. (If you think you have Covid-19, and are curious about what that means for you, read this explainer. If you’re most confused about the financial crisis the virus is causing, read this one.) This guide focuses mostly on the properties of the virus, and the implications for public health.

In the few months since this virus emerged, we’ve learned an immense amount about it. Scientists have decoded its genetics and whom it’s more likely to kill, and have started working on vaccines that could immunize humans to it. Still, its newness means that a lot of the figures presented in this article are estimates and subject to change as scientists learn more. So keep that in mind, too.

1) SARS-CoV-2 is very contagious, and a huge portion of the global population is vulnerable

One thing we do know is that this coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is very contagious. Just look at the headlines: Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, has now infected nearly a million people around the globe.

Scientists quantify the contagiousness of a disease with a figure called R0 (pronounced R-nought.) “The figure refers to how many other people one sick person is likely to infect on average in a group that’s susceptible to the disease (meaning they don’t already have immunity from a vaccine or from fighting off the disease before),” Vox’s Julia Belluz explains. An R0 of 2, for example, means each infected person is expected to spread the virus to two others, on average. Covid-19 is currently believed to have an R0 between 2 and 2.5.

That makes it more contagious than the seasonal flu. With the flu, there are people in the population who have some level of immunity to it — either because of a vaccine or because they have been exposed to that strain of flu in the past. That’s not the case here.

With no mitigation, a statistical modeling report from the Imperial College of London found that 81 percent of the populations of both Great Britain and the US could be infected over the course of the pandemic.

The R0 is hard to estimate, even in a pandemic, because “the R0 is not a property of the virus,” explains Dominique Heinke, an epidemiologist in Massachusetts. The virus’s genetic code, the proteins that surround it, and the symptoms it causes are properties of the virus. The R0 is “a combination of the properties of the virus, and the way that humans interact.”

Also important to know: R0 is the rate of transmission within a fully susceptible population, when no control measures are put into place. “One misconception about the R0 is that it is a fixed number — but actually, it varies over time and over context,” says Caitlin Rivers, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “So it has been well established that the R0 with this disease, at least before we implement any interventions, is well over 2.”

But our actions can bring this figure down. This is sometimes called the Re, or effective reproduction rate. “If we can get Re [to be less than] 1 through social distancing, natural immunity, or a vaccine, then we break the cycle of transmission and the epidemic will slow or be suppressed,” Heinke says.

2) The virus is believed to be spread mainly by respiratory droplets

Why has the virus spread so fast? The WHO recently put out a statement saying its experts believe Covid-19 is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets. When infected people breathe, cough, or sneeze, they expel little droplets of moisture that contain the virus. Another person in their vicinity could breathe in these particles and get infected. The virus-laden droplets can also land on surfaces that others may touch (and then get infected by touching their mouth, nose, or eyes). Scientists now believe the virus can remain viable on a hard, non-porous surface like plastic or steel for around three days, and a rough surface like cardboard for about a day.

The 6-feet-away social distancing guideline is meant to keep people out of the splash zone for these respiratory droplets. (But know there’s no hard cutoff for how far the viral droplets can spread. A sneeze can propel material from the nose 20 feet or more, a recent MIT study found.)

It’s also unknown how significant other modes of transmission are in spreading the disease. There are two other possible routes being explored: fecal-oral and airborne.

Fecal-oral transmission occurs when a virus spreads, well, through feces (usually by contaminating water or food through improper hygiene). Scientists have noted the presence of the virus in some feces of infected people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, though, that “the risk [of fecal-oral transmission] is expected to be low based on data from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses.” (That said, if you weren’t already: Please wash your hands enthusiastically after defecating.)

You may have heard that the new coronavirus isn’t “airborne” — meaning that unlike extremely contagious diseases like measles, it’s unlikely to linger in the air for hours on end. But that doesn’t mean the virus can’t linger in the air for some amount of time.

As Wired explains, although some experts say the novel coronavirus isn’t airborne, that’s based on a narrow scientific definition of the term. The virus can possibly still linger in the air for some time and under some conditions. We don’t yet know precisely what those conditions are. It will definitely be in the air in the moments after an infected person sneezes or coughs, but it’s unclear when the particles eventually come to rest on the ground (or on surrounding surfaces).

Overall, it doesn’t appear that airborne contagion is a big factor with this outbreak. “In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, airborne transmission was not reported,” the WHO reports. But it warns that “airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings.” Certain medical procedures like intubation, suctioning, and ventilation could possibly create airborne viral aerosols. Because these occur in hospital settings, it’s extra important for health care workers to wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE) to make sure they don’t get sick.

Another big reason Covid-19 has spread so far and wide is that people with mild symptoms — and even people without symptoms — can spread it. (Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are recognized by the CDC as common symptoms, but others such as loss of smell and taste have been reported as well, and symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear.)

There are no firm estimates on this, but it seems that somewhere between 25 and 50 percent of people infected with the virus show no symptoms. Some percentage of those asymptomatic cases can spread the virus to others. (We’ll need more widespread surveillance testing to better understand the exact rate of asymptomatic cases.)

On March 13, the journal Science published an analysis that concluded 86 percent of all the Covid-19 cases in China before January 23 were not detected by public health authorities at the time (though that doesn’t mean these cases were asymptomatic). It’s estimated that these undiagnosed cases infected 79 percent of the total cases. The results suggest that, at least, the bulk of transmission of the virus in China was spread by people not sick enough to get the attention of doctors.

The fact that this virus can spread sneakily and silently makes it extra dangerous. It’s also possible to spread it before a person develops symptoms.

On April 1, the CDC published a report on how presymptomatic spread created clusters of many new cases in Singapore. In one case, the virus appeared to have spread via a church pew. Two people who had recently visited China attended church services on January 19, when they had no symptoms (they would develop them in the following days). Three other people who attended the church that day got sick, the CDC found — one of whom sat in the same seat as the people who visited China. Another instance of presymptomatic spread was found in a singing class. In others, presymptomatic cases spread in households.

3) Covid-19 is deadly

The exact death rate of the virus is another figure that’s still being calculated — and is changing all the time. Here’s the latest: A new paper in Lancet Infectious Diseases found the case fatality ratio (the percent of confirmed infections that die) to be 1.38 percent, drawing from Chinese data (which may or may not be complete). The authors also report an estimated infection fatality rate — this is the percentage of people who become infected, including those who have mild or no symptoms, who eventually die. This figure is lower, at 0.66 percent.

But there’s a huge amount of variability on this figure country by country, and demographic by demographic. South Korea, on the one hand, is estimated to have a death rate of less than 1 percent. Italy’s seems to be, for now, several percentage points higher.

The Lancet Infectious Diseases paper found that globally, the case fatality rate for those under age 60 was 1.4 percent. For those over age 60, the fatality rate jumps to 4.5 percent. The older the population, the higher the fatality rate grows. For those 80 and over, Covid-19 appears to have a 13.4 percent fatality rate.

These likely will not be the final estimates of the fatality rate for Covid-19. Like R0, “the mortality rate is not a characteristic of the virus,” Heinke explains. “The mortality rate is a function of both the severity of disease that the virus can cause and treatment. ... The mortality rate may increase as hospitals become more and more overwhelmed with cases.”

And the figure changes over time. In late February, the WHO estimated the rate in Wuhan was 5.8 percent. Now, the estimated death rate for Wuhan — the city where the outbreak began — is 1.4 percent, per a March 9 study in Nature Medicine.

“It feels like you should be able to just divide deaths by cases, and whatever that number is feels like it should be CFR,” or case fatality rate, Rivers says. But it’s not that simple. “If there are a lot of people either in the numerator or denominator that aren’t being recognized, it can change your answer a lot.” With testing lagging in the United States, it’s hard to know how many cases there are overall, and therefore, it’s hard to estimate the overall fatality rate.

One thing we do know: Older people, and people with underlying conditions, are much more likely to die of Covid-19 than younger people.

4) The pandemic in the US will get worse before it gets better

On March 31, the White House’s coronavirus task force presented grim statistics: Under the best-case scenario for mitigation of the Covid-19 pandemic, there may be between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths in the United States, with the number of deaths peaking in the next two weeks.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also emphasized that the outbreak and its toll are going to get worse before they get better. “As sobering a number as [100,000 deaths] is,” he said, “we should be prepared for it. Is it going to be that much? I hope not.” A recent study in The Lancet found that, on average, the duration from symptoms to death is 17.8 days (and that recovery can take nearly 25 days). Other studies have shown it can take a week for the disease to progress from the start of symptoms to a person needing hospitalization. Some people just getting infected now in places that still haven’t enacted strict social distancing measures could die a month from now.

Look at the Wuhan line on this new graph from @jburnmurdoch. The lockdown was introduced there on 23rd Jan – 69 days ago – which means this entire Wuhan curve has happened since then. It shows how long it can take to see the effect of control measures on the number of deaths. pic.twitter.com/MAsBIzFevj — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) April 1, 2020

Epidemiological modeling is useful in helping the public think through what’s possible with the disease. It also can help hospitals understand how much staffing and equipment they’ll need (and where they are likely to fall short).

Independent experts say the models the task force is using are sound: 100,000 to 200,000 deaths “certainly seem to be within the reasonable framework,” said Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in a call with reporters Tuesday morning. “I would not be particularly surprised by them, I wouldn’t be surprised if they were higher, I wouldn’t be actually surprised if they were lower. One of the things that’s difficult for those of us who’ve been involved with modeling this is communicating the amounts of uncertainty that we have.”

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

Modeling is not an ironclad prediction of the future, however. “Unlike the weather, which we’re all accustomed to and incorporating forecasts into decision making, with pandemics we actually influence the outcome,” Rivers says. Collective actions — continuing to social distance, self-isolating if you’re sick, supporting health care workers around the country, raising the capacity of the health care system — over the next few weeks will affect whether the models are updated for better or for worse.

“I think it’s key not to get fixated on the exact numbers,” Heinke adds. “You can look at a range of models and say, we can expect it to be at least this bad.”

5) There’s a huge range of severity of illness

Young people may not be dying of Covid-19 in high numbers, but they are still at risk for severe, debilitating disease.

As of March 16, the CDC reports that 12 percent of known Covid-19 cases in the US have resulted in hospitalizations, and 20 percent of those hospitalizations were among those ages 20 to 44. To note: As of March 16, the CDC had reported 4,226 cases in the United States, so this data may be refined in the coming weeks. As of April 2, there were more than 216,000 cases in the US.

In New York City, which as of April 2 has the biggest Covid-19 outbreak in the United States, 9 percent of more than 7,700 hospitalizations were for those ages 18 to 44 as of March 31.

The bottom line: In all age groups, Covid-19 can present with a huge range of severity. Many people — an exact figure is still not known — can get the virus and show no symptoms. Others become near deathly ill.

Scientists have some clues as to what puts someone more at risk than another.

“Patients with underlying health conditions and risk factors, including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal disease, and smoking, might be at higher risk for severe disease or death from Covid-19,” the CDC found in a recent report.

But there are still a lot of unknowns about what else contributes to risk. Even among older people, there are unanswered questions: Why do men appear to be dying at higher rates than women? Differences in severity of illness could also relate to the amount of the virus a person has been exposed to. Health care workers, when they are infected, seem to get sicker than their age cohort should suggest, which could be because they are exposed to higher doses of the virus.

Scientists will soon start to search for genetic clues, too, that might signal a person is more at risk than another. The reason might have to do more with their own biology than the virus: In some people, an excessive immune reaction called a “cytokine storm” is what leads to the most severe symptoms and death, not the virus itself.

“It’s really an open question to try to figure out why some of these younger people are getting really, really severe disease, and if there are other risk factors that we are not appreciating,” Angela Rasmussen, a Columbia University virologist, said in March. “Some of that will just have to wait until we have really detailed clinical data on all the cases that are coming out now in Italy and in the United States.” Knowing who is most at risk, she says, “will help in terms of flattening the curve.” If we learn how to protect the young people most at risk and keep them out of hospitals, we can decrease the strain on health care systems.

6) The US is still not doing enough testing

It’s worth remembering why hundreds of millions in the US are under stay-at-home orders, with infection rates soaring across the country.

“The facts remain that we wasted a lot of time in terms of ramping up testing,” Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, says. The US could have spent a lot more time diagnosing and isolating the sick, and tracing their contacts, which could have prevented at least some of the spread.

Testing in an outbreak provides two functions. One is to diagnose those who are sick. The other is surveillance: to see where the virus may be lurking, especially in cases where symptoms are mild or don’t manifest at all. The US has barely had enough testing capacity to test the sickest, let alone the capacity to do surveillance. Many doctors are telling patients with milder symptoms to just stay home and not get tested.

The US has caught up to some of the early stumbles. The Atlantic, which has been aggressively tracking the testing situation across the country, reports that around 104,000 people are being tested a day. But “testing backlogs have ballooned, slowing efficient patient care and delivering a heavily lagged view of the outbreak to decision makers,” the Atlantic’s Robinson Meyer and Alexis Madrigal write.

America needs strict social distancing measures in place, in part, because it’s unknown exactly where the virus is. And it’s unknown because testing still lags.

People need to stay in under the assumption that anyone they come into contact with could be infected. “The classic epidemiological approach to controlling disease is not to shut down society; it’s to target the people you know to have the disease and understand who they’re spreading it to,” Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, says. “We can’t do that right now because we don’t have enough testing to know who has the disease.”

Not only does the US need more testing, it also needs testing that can be completed within minutes. These rapid tests are in the works: Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved one that can give results in five minutes. It’s now being rolled out in parts of the West Coast.

But the US needs other kinds of testing, too, like serology — testing of people’s blood for antibodies to the virus. That way, health professionals can figure out who has already had the disease and is now immune and can safely return to be in contact with others. (Though scientists still need to do more work in determining what immunity looks like in any given person.)

7) Lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders are not an overreaction

Three out of four Americans are now under some sort of lockdown or shelter-in-place order from their local authorities. For many of them, the best thing they can do right now is just be patient.

There may be a lag of a few weeks before these difficult measures are reflected in new case and death data.

Right now, many people are still getting sick and requiring hospitalization, who were infected before these orders went into effect. The virus can incubate for up to 14 days before symptoms appear, and then it can be several more days before severe illness sets in.

This means many cities and regions are still seeing the early part of the wave of cases hitting their health care systems. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says his state may still be two weeks away from the virus’s peak.

All of this is reason to keep social distancing: The outright lockdowns of movement in some cities, as well as the less severe policies in place across the country, can still dramatically slow the spread of Covid-19. And per at least one poll, people are, by and large, complying.

Also know: This is likely still going to get worse before it gets better.

“In the next several days to a week, we will continue to see things go up,” Fauci said on March 31. “We cannot be discouraged by that — the mitigation is working and it will work.”

8) The situation for hospitals and health care workers is dire

First, the US had a shortage of diagnostic tests for Covid-19. Now there’s also a shortage of personal protective equipment and supplies — from medical masks and gowns to hospital beds and ventilators. And the fear is there will soon be a shortage of health care workers responding to the disease. In Italy, more than 60 doctors have died of the disease.

As Vox’s Dylan Scott, Umair Irfan, and Jen Kirby report, “Doctors and nurses are reporting gear shortages, lax protocols, and a high level of stress in their workplaces — with the worst still to come. Some of them told Vox that they consider getting infected with the coronavirus an inevitability.”

Health care workers may even be putting themselves at higher risk of severe disease just by doing their jobs. “It’s not just that [health care workers] are getting infected at higher rates; instead, they’re getting sicker than one might expect on the basis of their age,” says Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College. It’s possible they’re being exposed to higher concentrations of the virus, which may lead a person to more severe illness.

Meanwhile, the protective equipment that might stop them from getting sick is in short supply. Particularly acute is the supply of N95 respirators, which stop health care workers from inhaling viral-laden droplets and aerosols.

9) America can end social distancing, but an aggressive new plan needs to be in place

It’s understandable that some — maybe most — people want life to go back to normal already.

But “If we all just went right back to how things were before, transmission would start again with the same intensity,” Rivers says. To ease off social distancing, the US needs an aggressive new plan in place to prevent the explosive growth in new cases it’s currently seeing.

“Social distancing is basically a sledgehammer,” Konyndyk, who has worked on past outbreaks, like Ebola, says. “You’re just stopping everything and hoping that in the process you will also slow transmission.” What the US needs to do, he says, is turn that sledgehammer of social distancing into a scalpel: widespread testing and contact tracing.

Once there’s widespread testing, there needs to be a huge team of public health workers in place to trace the contacts of those who test positive. Everyone who tests positive or who has come into contact with someone who tests positive then needs to be put into quarantine or isolation, to not spread the virus further. This is how authorities routinely beat outbreaks — even of incredibly infectious diseases like measles.

Rivers, along with former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and other co-authors, released a plan Sunday for how to ease off social distancing. The plan has several phases: Phase one is slowing the spread through social distancing while ramping up testing capacity and ensuring hospitals have the equipment they need. In phase two, social distancing restrictions ease while public health workers continue to track and isolate cases.

But it will take a lot to get there. The authors argue these decisions need to be made on a region-by-region basis: Phase two should only begin after 14 days of sustained case reductions in an area, and only after testing capacity is dramatically increased. Even in phase two, they stress, if cases go up again, the US will need to go back to severe social distancing. Before there’s a vaccine, everyone will have to remain vigilant.

10) The pandemic is painful for millions — not just those who are sick with Covid-19

Outbreaks don’t just affect those who get sick with the illness and die — there’s also a lot of collateral damage. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Health care bills are piling up. Businesses are furloughing or laying off workers.

As the outbreak progresses, it will expose the cracks in American society and the country’s preparedness for future outbreaks. Americans need to remember the lessons learned over the next several months.

Also important: the collateral medical damage. Hospitals are postponing elective surgeries (ones that are planned in advance) and some other treatments. There could be limited resources to treat others if another disaster strikes, like a flood or a hurricane.

11) Some parts of life may return to normal. But this won’t be over until there’s a vaccine and widely available treatments.

The ultimate goal in stopping a pandemic is a safe and effective vaccine that can prevent people from getting the virus. The good news is that these are already being tested. The bad news is that it could take a year or more to find one that is safe and effective. “Honestly, I think the vaccine in 12 to 18 months is a moonshot,” Tara Smith, a Kent State University epidemiologist, says.

In the meantime, a treatment might be discovered sooner. The World Health Organization is facilitating a multinational clinical trial, testing medicines — and combinations of medicines — to treat Covid-19. But even those drugs wouldn’t necessarily stop the outbreak.

“It would be really great, I think, for saving lives,” Rivers says. “But you wouldn’t really expect it to slow transmission at all.” People could still be getting sick and spreading the virus. And everyone would need to be vigilant, and patient, in this scenario, too. Even if the risk of severe disease and death is reduced, if the number of cases increases, more people can still get sick and die.

12) The coronavirus came from nature, jumping from animals to humans. Researchers fear this will happen again.

The novel coronavirus outbreak presents an immense immediate challenge for global health. But it’s also part of a larger pattern: Viruses that circulate in animals keep jumping over to infect humans. The story of the novel coronavirus is the story of HIV, of SARS, of Ebola, and even measles. These are all diseases that have been introduced to humans — with deadly effects — via animals. And as humans encroach more and more into animal habitats, it’s believed these spillover events may only grow more common.

Scientists know this virus jumped from an animal to a human, but they are not sure exactly how or where. “If you don’t understand where it came from, then it’s hard to make policies, procedures, to prevent it from happening again,” says Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician and Emerging Leader in Biosecurity fellow at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.

It likely started with a bat — the genetics of the novel coronavirus suggest that it did. As Vox’s Eliza Barclay reported:

What researchers have to figure out now is how exactly the coronavirus jumped to humans: perhaps through a human eating an infected animal, or through humans being exposed to infected feces or urine. “All we know [is] its likely distant source was bats, but we don’t know who was between bats and people,” said Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia and host of the This Week in Virology podcast. “It could be a direct infection [between bats and humans] as well.”

A lot of the evidence points toward the outbreak either starting or significantly gaining steam at a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The more we know about how this virus jumped from animals to humans, the more authorities can help make sure an outbreak with this origin doesn’t spiral out of control and spread around the world again.

Share All sharing options for: The legacy of the pandemic: 11 ways it will change the way we live

Part of the Pandemic Issue of The Highlight, our home for ambitious stories that explain our world.

Covid-19 has moved like wildfire — at first seemingly far away, then unnervingly close — as it has ripped across the world in a few months, leaving tens of thousands dead, economies flattened, and the futures of hundreds of millions of people in limbo.

As many of us shelter in place with no end in sight, it’s only human for us to imagine how life will resume, even if the unfamiliar and unpredictable behavior of the virus has made it difficult to know with any certainty.

The longer the global effort to stymie the pandemic through lockdown continues, however, the less likely we’ll reemerge into a world we recognize. Already, some things are clear: Health care, stretched to horrifying extremes in afflicted cities, must change, and it will. The world’s Instagram-fueled love affair with travel will cool. Many will keep stashes of personal protective equipment at the ready; many more will lose faith in governments to assist us, much less protect us.

To begin to envision the legacy of this Covid-19, Vox asked experts in fields ranging from behavioral sciences to economics; restaurateurs; and big thinkers on democracy and public health to predict what’s next. These, they say, are 11 ways the pandemic will transform our societies.

A “quarantine state of mind” will reign for weeks, if not months

For many, the doldrums of quarantine are now giving way to post-isolation fantasies, as people pledge to spend more time with family and friends, or finally book that bucket-list trip. But even the smallest and sweetest of goals — getting a haircut, giving a hug, or grabbing a drink — could feel like climbing Mount Kilimanjaro when we’re free.

“We’re going to have to work through this quarantine state of mind even when the physical quarantine has lifted,” says Sheva Rajaee, founder of the Center for Anxiety and OCD in Irvine, California.

The coronavirus has made intimacy feel treacherous, because the disease can sometimes move from person to person through the most mundane activities, like talking, kissing, even singing. That it can be transmitted asymptomatically has forced us to envision everyone as a potential threat. “We are training people to see the world as a dangerous place. This invisible enemy could be anywhere,” says David Spiegel, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. Interacting with your barber or bartender won’t be easy if you view them as potential carriers. “There will be a lot of damage to be undone as people try and rebuild some semblance of a normal life,” Spiegel says, adding that “avoidance makes phobias worse.” Exposure will be an important part of recovery.

The temporary solution to the coronavirus — self-quarantine, and potentially months of it — not only delays this process, but also has psychological repercussions of its own. The true extent of the problem is not yet clear, and there are few analogues. But in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated, “some people there now refuse to leave their homes and have developed agoraphobia,” psychiatrist Steven Taylor told the Atlantic. FOMO has morphed into FOGO, or the fear of going out. Some people’s reticence to reengage with society may resolve on its own, Rajaee says, but “for many, this is the beginning of a lifetime of management.”

The mask will become a wardrobe staple

In the United States, masks are more readily associated with crime than public health. We’re a nation of mask skeptics: Several states have enacted anti-mask laws throughout history as a means of quelling protest and stifling dissent. But the immediacy of the pandemic — the horror stories of bodies stacked up in refrigerated trucks, the overwhelmed hospitals, and the atmosphere of fear and paranoia created in its wake — will force Westerners to reconsider old stigmas associated with masks for the sake of public health.

The mask aversion is compounded by the longstanding epidemic of police violence against people of color, some of whom understandably fear the consequences of purchasing essential goods while cloaked in a prophylactic bandana. Even now, it’s easy for a mask to evoke dastardly connotations or be mistaken for a disguise.

“Wearing a mask may be even stranger to us than wearing a Speedo at the beach,” says Brandon Brown, an epidemiologist and associate professor at UC Riverside. “It’s just not the norm [in the US], so there is judgment, but there is nothing wrong with it.”

In China and other nations, masks are now part of everyday life, Abrar Chughtai, an epidemiologist and researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says via email. “Asian countries have faced such epidemics and pandemics more in the past,” he says, including SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, which still looms large in the public imagination in China and Hong Kong.

These nations have long understood face coverings as a public health resource and a tool for cultivating national unity. It’s routine, for example, to see people donning masks on the streets of Beijing, Seoul, or Taipei as they take to the streets or socialize with friends, because someone with a cough will likely be hesitant to put their neighbors in jeopardy.

“It does seem that in general, thinking of and protecting others is more of a norm in some countries other than our own,” Brown says.

But public sentiment on the issue of masks is evolving. Just as the US mobilizes to provide front-line workers with personal protective equipment amid mass shortages, brands are also swooping in to meet a surge in demand for masks that gel with modern consumer tastes. Cloth masks designed and marketed by Los Angeles Apparel and Christian Siriano are reflections of this broader shift in the cultural climate. Mega-influencers like Kim Kardashian and Bella Hadid have also endorsed them with pandemic-era selfies, lending masks a stamp of pop-culture-approved normalcy.

Though the science behind the effectiveness of masks is far from exact, living through the pandemic will undeniably alter Western attitudes about them, as well as government policy. And as the memory of Covid-19 becomes permanently enmeshed with the national psyche, masks are likely to become a fixture of our post-pandemic world.

Child care will finally be recognized as essential work, too

It was one of the earliest and most visible effects of the coronavirus pandemic: First one, then several, then all 50 states shuttered schools. Many day care centers closed, too, and in the span of a few weeks in March and April, tens of millions of American parents, most of whom ordinarily work outside the home, suddenly became full-time child care workers.

For the relatively fortunate, that has meant trying to work from home while simultaneously caring for children without help from family members and caretakers they might ordinarily lean on — and without the ability to entertain kids with trips or play dates.

For others, it has meant making a wrenching decision between taking care of family and getting a paycheck (the federal stimulus bill includes paid leave for some parents, but not all).

Either way, for many people around the country, parents and non-parents alike, the sheer work of taking care of children all day suddenly has become extremely obvious.

In the past, that work has often been invisible. Many parents “feel the need to hide or minimize the evidence of their children at the office,” economist Emily Oster has written, because they fear being sidelined. Meanwhile, about 80 percent of private sector employees — and 93 percent of low-wage workers — have zero paid parental leave.

America’s undervaluation of the work of child care is also evidenced in its treatment of child care workers, who make an average of $10.82 an hour and often lack health insurance and other benefits. Many are on some form of public assistance and live paycheck-to-paycheck even in the best of times. As child care provider Miren Algorri told Vox, “We’re overworked, we’re underpaid, and we don’t even exist.”

But now the work of child care suddenly isn’t as invisible. Kids have started popping up in Zoom meetings. Parents who once might have been able to practice what Oster has called “secret parenting” have had to ask for flexibility, and some employers (though by no means all) have begun to grant it.

Cities have set up emergency child care centers, with officials understanding, perhaps for the first time, that nurses and bus drivers can’t go to work if there’s no one to care for their children. Even the federal government has set aside $3.5 billion for child care in its relief package for American workers.

For the first time in a long time, Americans have been forced to acknowledge that taking care of kids is difficult, necessary work.

As Algorri put it, “We are the workforce behind the workforce.”

America will become a nation of savers

The effect of the coronavirus pandemic on our sense of economic confidence will have everything to do with how long we are stuck inside, how long we are out of work, and what safety nets fail us in the interim. Even if stay-at-home orders are mostly “over” by this summer, how many of us would risk our lives to frequent restaurants or go shopping? The virus, whenever it’s over, will affect our every financial, demographic, and lifestyle decision, from borrowing money to having children to living in crowded cities.

The US consumer confidence index has already dropped 30 percent since February. Millions of newly unemployed workers and small businesses already can’t or aren’t paying their rent or mortgage.

And it’s all happening as about 30 percent of Americans have zero emergency savings, and only one-fifth have savings sufficient to last six months. No surprise — our country has been overspending for decades. Our national saving rate has declined dramatically since the 1950s and ’60s. If and when people emerge from their homes, they’ll be cowed, not confident, economic actors.

Fewer Americans will start businesses, and those they start will be safely online; surviving businesses will hire and borrow less. People may prepay their mortgages instead of maxing out their 401(k)s or playing the market. Many people will start saving not for a rainy day but for a years-long deluge.

Just as families during the Great Depression relied on kitchen gardens and community “thrift gardens” to grow food rather than buy it, we’ll return to growing our own food to the extent we have space or can move somewhere that does. Entertainment and social events will move to potlucks, board games, and other living room entertainment instead of movies or restaurants, just as it did during that period.

For those with the means, the first trip won’t be to Gucci, if it’s there. It may be to Kansas to buy a small home, with ample land for planting and posting Keep Out signs.

The US will test-run more just policing and incarceration

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, incarcerated Americans — the 2.3 million people often housed in overcrowded facilities, many people of color, many with undermanaged chronic health problems — have emerged as one of the nation’s most vulnerable populations. Outbreaks have ripped through prisons and jails including New York’s Rikers Island, Illinois facilities including Chicago’s Cook County Jail and the Stateville Correctional Center, the Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan, and many others across the nation — a scenario that was unnervingly predictable.

In response, some local governments are suspending jail time for technical violations, and reducing arrests for low-level offenses such as prostitution or minor drug crimes; the federal government is also identifying at-risk prisoners who could serve the rest of their sentences at home. Some older and otherwise vulnerable prisoners, pretrial detainees, and people serving misdemeanor sentences have already been released. For many, this is a permanent early release. For others, they are free until they have to return for trial.

These aren’t reforms. They’re emergency tactics. But they could serve as a transformative moment, a glimpse at whether efforts to reduce the number of imprisoned should be permanent. We could end “broken windows” policing for minor street-level drug and quality-of-life offenses, which lead to too many low-level arrests. We could end cash bail, which perpetuates the cycle of poverty and incarceration. We could stop issuing unimaginably long prison sentences that keep the incarceration rate high. We could start releasing older prisoners by granting them parole.

This pandemic has illuminated a broader view of the inequities in the US, and can serve as more than an opportunity to test and observe more just policing and incarceration policies. It could lead to permanent reform of our criminal justice system.

We’ll realize that the American economic system is fundamentally broken

The US has tied health insurance to employment and then shuttered broad swaths of the economy to respond to a health crisis, during which millions of workers have been laid off, leaving them without health coverage. Our social safety net is in disrepair and overwhelmed when people need it most. Many of our essential workers are making the minimum wage. People of color are dying of the coronavirus at disproportionate rates.

The economic and social framework of America was already tenuous, and the pandemic has broken it.

“We built an economy that is a very fine-tuned race car that can go very fast, and might occasionally win a few races,” says Roosevelt Institute president Felicia Wong, “but once it breaks down, it’s very difficult to fix, and there really is no underlying resilience.”

Wong believes we’re at a “crucial choice point,” in which we either repair the system with a Band-Aid that still leaves us fragile or move toward a government with more guardrails for the economy and a bigger role in setting the direction of our health, social insurance, and economic systems.

Many Americans have long believed in a pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps ideology — the “American dream,” that if you work hard enough, you can make it. It’s a country where the “us” is the people who made it, and the “them” — often with a racial element — are people who are viewed as lazy and inept. But rugged individualism and the free market can’t fix many of our current problems, and, in fact, have rendered the country increasingly vulnerable and fragile for years. Amid the current devastation, will we begin to imagine the role of the federal government in our society and our economy as one that takes a more hands-on, proactive approach? There’s a chance — though we will need leaders to drive us there, many of whom are being radicalized right now.

After moments of crises, the US government and its people historically have tended to want to go back to the way things were before, and it’s unclear that this time will be different, warns Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University. But we also can’t unsee what we’ve seen. “The proximate problem is the virus,” Michener says, “but the deeper problem is the structure of our social, political, and economic systems.”

Yet change isn’t always easy to perceive. The Occupy Wall Street movement, born out of the Great Recession, was broadly deemed a failure, but it has animated much of the leftist politics and policies of the past decade. America is broken — but it can be fixed.

Voting will become easier — and turnout might go up

The images of Wisconsin’s recent election — the first in-person election held during the height of the Covid-19 US outbreak — were dystopian. In Milwaukee, where the number of available polling places shrank from 180 to just five for a city of about 592,000 people, voters wearing surgical masks stood 6 feet apart in lines stretching around the block. One woman held up a large homemade sign emblazoned with the words “This is ridiculous.”

“Wisconsin is a messy dress rehearsal for what will happen in November if we don’t act,” ACLU voting rights campaign strategist Molly McGrath recently told Vox.

The pandemic has temporarily upended US elections as some states push back their primaries to early June. But this time is giving lawmakers an opportunity to reimagine what our elections system could look like.

While electronic voting is still a faraway goal, given concerns about the possibility of hacking, ideas are already circulating for how states could get paper ballots into the hands of more voters and increase turnout. In the five states that already have universal vote-by-mail, studies have found voter turnout increases particularly among those less likely to vote in person. Exercising one’s constitutional right to vote could be as easy as checking a box, sealing an envelope, and putting it in the mail. (Even if it is a process that might slow down vote counting.)

In the Senate, the effort is being led by Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who introduced a bill in the wake of coronavirus that would expand both in-person early voting and no-excuse absentee vote by mail. It would require states to set up contingency plans in the event we are still social distancing by the November general election.

The bill would open up in-person polls 20 days before election day in each state to give people the opportunity to vote early, require all mail-in ballots submitted in the 21 days leading up to an election be counted, and make it so all voters can request an absentee ballot.

Similar processes are already in place in some other countries: In Switzerland, for example, all voters receive mail-in ballots that they can submit up to three weeks before the election, and in New Zealand, advance voting polls are set up 12 days before election day.

There’s increased agreement among Democratic and Republican governors and secretaries of states that something must be done to coronavirus-proof their elections. New Hampshire’s Republican Gov. Chris Sununu recently announced that the state could expand absentee voting if the virus persists into the fall, a measure he has previously opposed, and Republican officials in other states may do the same.

But getting all states ready will take time and a lot of federal money. And President Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans are balking at expanding vote-by-mail access, even though there’s no evidence it favors Democrats, and some Republican states have long used it.

The pandemic, and Wisconsin’s election in the midst of it, could be a watershed moment to make the case for vote-by-mail reform.

Restaurants will close — and what’s left could be vanilla

Hoyo’s Kitchen isn’t as busy as it used to be. The family-owned Somali restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, had to close its buffet brick-and-mortar location; only its stall in the city’s North Market remains open. Mohammad Hassan, who owns the restaurant with his brother and their mother, says he’s seen a dispiriting 50 percent drop in customers since the pandemic began, but says, “I take solace in the fact that it’s not only us.”

Hassan’s story resembles that of many immigrant restaurateurs who have long enriched America’s dining ecosystem. The pandemic has laid bare the restaurant industry’s creaky foundations. Media coverage has focused on celebrity chefs with name recognition and lofty net worths, obscuring restaurants like Hassan’s that are disproportionately vulnerable to extinction.

Predictions late last month suggested that 75 percent of independent restaurants won’t weather the pandemic, which has forced closures of untold thousands of eating and drinking establishments nationwide. Many independent restaurateurs doubt that the CARES Act’s Paycheck Protection Program will provide sufficient loan coverage for their restaurants. Capital may flow more easily toward larger businesses, further marginalizing restaurants without investors or large social media followings: Danny Meyer’s Shake Shack, with more than 200 locations, for example, attracted widespread criticism when it applied for and received a small-business relief loan. (The company later announced that it would return the money.)

This means the pandemic could wipe out eateries that showcase immigrant fare. Some owners fear facing prejudices that their cuisines aren’t profitable enough to save because they aren’t continental European. Others haven’t applied for relief funds like the one offered by the James Beard Foundation — suspended within hours of launching after a logjam of responses — due to language barriers and lack of access to public relations firms that could help them navigate labyrinthine application processes. Hassan himself is reluctant to apply for these funds without fully understanding the fine print, fearing any misstep may leave his struggling business “liable to pay things back.”

But without such restaurants, a class of talented chefs (without material privileges to start) would be jobless and unable to display their talents. Diners would have to settle for a sterile culinary monoculture where corporate chains dot the country.

Toni Elkhouri of Cedar’s Cafe in Melbourne, Florida, applied but hasn’t heard back from the Beard fund. She’s not holding her breath. Elkhouri and her mother, Marlene, have pivoted to curbside delivery and preselling their Mediterranean meals for holidays, helping them level an initial 83 percent loss in business. “Otherwise we will die on the vine,” she said. “No one will come and save us.”

Free money might someday be bound for your bank account

Universal basic income (UBI) is the idea that the government should give every citizen a regular infusion of free money, no strings attached. It’s moved from the fringes into the mainstream over the past few years, with several countries around the world running pilot programs to test it.

Now, the coronavirus and its economic ripple effects are bolstering the view that such payments are necessary — during the pandemic, and even after it.

Spain has announced it will roll out a basic income “as soon as possible” to help its citizens cope. Crucially, Deputy Prime Minister Nadia Calvino said the government aims to make this something that “stays forever, that becomes a structural instrument, a permanent instrument.” In the UK, more than 170 members of Parliament have also urged the government to give citizens a UBI during the pandemic, though so far their calls have been rejected.

Scott Santens, a prominent UBI advocate, said he believes the pandemic will make a UBI in the US more likely as well.

“Through no fault of their own, people are finding themselves in need of money,” he told Vox. “This profound feeling of insecurity may be quite new to people who felt they had job security, and they may gain an appreciation for permanent economic security through an income floor that would always be there, just in case.”

Political figures such as Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang also say the US should follow suit.

“People who may even have symptoms are going to work in public places because they don’t feel they have a choice,” Yang told CNBC. “A Universal Basic Income would enable these waitresses and parking attendants and [ride-hail] drivers to stay home.”

Although some Americans are getting a one-time $1,200 coronavirus stimulus payment, those are not a true UBI; they’re an emergency stopgap measure rather than a permanent program. UBI gives people income stability so they can do long-term planning, which in turn can make them happier and healthier.

Many people are now encountering the inadequacy of the American safety net for the first time. They’re finding it deeply frustrating to have to make dozens or even hundreds of attempts to file benefits claims while unemployment offices are overwhelmed by demand. It could be simpler and more humanizing for money to simply show up in their bank accounts.

“As people get more frustrated with bureaucracy and conditions,” Santens said, “I think they will start thinking differently about a system that operates differently, one built on trust and dignity instead of distrust and degradation.”

Say goodbye to handshakes, and casual hugs and kisses

The shock of Covid-19 has already caused people to rethink norms as simple as shaking hand. As we try better to protect ourselves and our loved ones during this — and future — pandemics, we will create new taboos around personal hygiene and behaviors.

Terms such as personal protective equipment (PPE) have already entered common parlance, a phenomenon that could be extended to personal protective behaviors (call it PPB): actions such as never coughing or sneezing into the open air or onto one’s hands, and avoiding touching one’s eyes, nose, or mouth. People will wash their hands and avoid touching public objects much more, and greetings that do not involve hand-to-hand contact will be popular.

Historically, certain behaviors become taboo for what on the surface are religious or cultural reasons, but probably originate from an understanding of their health risks. Cultures that don’t eat pork, for example, likely stopped because in warm climates the meat often carried dangerous parasites such as trichinella worms. Now, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the top US expert on the virus, has supported the idea that we should never shake hands again, and seeing people in films hugging, shaking hands, and kissing is already causing a frisson.

In the post Covid-19 world, the strengthening of taboos is inevitable. A cross-cultural shift will leave people less keen to engage in physical ways to show politeness or affection.

Religions will embrace their online future

Recently, just off Interstate 40 in a western part of North Carolina, a clergy member and 10 funeral guests stood several feet apart from one another around a casket as it was lowered. As the cars drove by, the mourners dispersed, heading back to their own places of isolation, unable to hug each other as the intimate, albeit distant service concluded.

When history looks back on this moment, one thing will be clear for religious and spiritual leaders: Gathering together matters most. Though many will bemoan the livestreaming efforts, the lack of in-person worship, or the fruition of online giving — in the midst of the worst of the pandemic, and after, many religious leaders will claim virtual community-building as a means of survival and growth.

Many pastors are grappling with the complexity of encouraging older church members to use online services and giving; urban and suburban churches that minister to homeless populations are struggling to find those members if they don’t have a physical address. Some might say these issues have always been there. While that may be true, the isolation and distancing — and the desire for spiritual guidance right now — makes these realities all the more complex.

As one pastor of a United Methodist Church in Los Angeles said, “The pandemic crystallizes our mission. We have to focus on what’s most essential for our respective communities.” It also provides a clearer vision of a leaner but kinder church — one capable of bending toward change. The recognition of love and truth-telling in a community setting should have been the mission of the church a long time ago, and for some clergy and congregations, it has been. But the takeaway is clear: People are in need of community, and though they can’t gather like they wish, they still wish to gather.

Perhaps soon those mourners in North Carolina can give their loved one the send-off they deserved. Until the moments of gathering return, communities of faith will continue forward into the unfolding future creatively — but only if they accept and embrace the possibility the innovation of this moment holds.

"['Emily Stewart', 'Apr']",2020-04-02,11 questions about the coronavirus economic crisis you were too embarrassed to ask,"Evidence-based explanations of the coronavirus crisis, from how it started to how it might end to how to protect yourself and others.

The American economy seems to have transformed in a matter of weeks as the coronavirus has brought activities across the country to a grinding halt. Not only did the US fail to anticipate the public health crisis caused by coronavirus, but it appears to be unprepared for the economic consequences of getting the pandemic under control.

Most Americans already know they are in a very different economic reality than they were in February. Restaurants are closed or only doing takeout or delivery. Clothing boutiques are shuttering. Americans across the economy have lost their jobs. Even workers whose jobs might be more stable probably don’t want to look at their 401(k)s.

Government officials have made a conscious decision to lock down parts of the economy and implement strict social distancing guidelines to try to better respond to the pandemic. President Donald Trump initially said he’d like to reopen the economy by Easter to avoid further damage — perhaps thinking it’s better to just keep the economy going and let the chips fall where they may — but people aren’t going to be falling over themselves to go to restaurants if there’s a deadly virus spreading. Trump ultimately backed off, and extended social distancing measures to the end of April. After all, the point of the economy is to serve people, not for people to serve it.

“There seems to be a segment of society that’s lost track of the purpose of markets,” said Aaron Klein, the policy director at the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. “Humanity created markets to efficiently distribute goods and services to serve humanity; markets did not create humanity to efficiently serve the will of the markets.”

We’re stuck in dual crises for the foreseeable future — one that’s health-related, and one that’s economic. Eventually this will end, but there’s no telling when. It’s a confusing time, including when it comes to the money-related end of things. So here are some answers to questions about the economic crisis that you were perhaps too embarrassed — or too afraid — to ask.

1) What is an economic crisis?

An economic crisis is a steep and sudden downturn of the economy. In terms of data, it shows up in a lot of places — GDP growth, unemployment numbers, productivity, and more. Data often lags behind real-time events, but what we already know paints a dire picture: an enormous spike in jobless claims and an economic contraction projection of disturbing proportions.

The US is definitely in an economic crisis right now, albeit a distinct one from crises past, including the one in most recent memory: the financial crisis and Great Recession in the late 2000s. “The prior recession started in the financial markets and affected the real economy; this will start in the real economy and affect the financial markets,” said Klein.

The problem right now isn’t subprime mortgages and banks and hedge funds making bets they shouldn’t — it’s that the US in the midst of a global health crisis and is taking extreme economic measures in an effort to protect the public’s well-being. Public officials have ordered shut wide swaths of the economy, including restaurants, travel, and hospitality, and it’s had a severe and immediate effect. Jobless claims have seen an unprecedented spike, with more than 16 million new claims being filed over the last three weeks alone. During the Great Recession, the highest week of losses was about 600,000, and 8.7 million total jobs were lost over the course of many months. Factories across the country have shut down, businesses are shuttered, and not only do people have less money to spend, they have fewer ways to spend it.

“Everything this time is happening bigger and faster,” Jason Furman, who served as an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, told Vox’s Li Zhou and Ella Nilsen recently in a piece laying out the differences between the 2008 crash and this one.

The question now is if and when the US will be able to get the virus under control so that the economy can start to open back up. “What we need is for everybody to stay home and not go broke doing it,” said Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton and former member of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. “The faster we can get this pandemic under control, the faster we can snap back.”

The longer the crisis goes on, the more challenging the recovery becomes, and the longer it will take.

2) What’s the difference between a recession and a depression?

There’s a well-known line among economists that a recession is when your neighbor loses their job, but a depression is when you lose yours, which perhaps gets at the air of difference between the two: A recession feels bad, a depression feels very bad. But the line between recession and depression can be a little fuzzy.

Traditionally, a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, but the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has a broader definition of a “significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy” that lasts for more than a few months and shows up in places like GDP, income, employment, production, and retail sales. In the US, a group within the NBER is officially charged with “calling” when a recession starts and ends — and it usually takes them some time after a recession begins for them to say it’s happening.

A depression, on the other hand, is a more severe and prolonged version of a recession. The Great Depression that lasted from 1929 to the early 1940s included not one but two major economic downturns — one from 1929 to 1933, and another from 1937 to 1938. Output fell sharply.

The coronavirus recession could indeed become a depression. The US is in uncharted territory in what’s going on in the economy — Americans have stopped working, stopped producing, and stopped consuming almost at the drop of a hat. The stock market is volatile, and business investment is slowing. Much of the country has been ground to a halt.

Whether or not the US slips into a depression depends in large part how well Americans are able to weather the storm while the coronavirus portion of the crisis gets figured out. Officials don’t want the economy to become so broken that it can’t be fixed.

“Ultimately, the economy will rebound when the pandemic is under control. The question is, how many businesses will be able to weather the storm, and how many workers will be able to?” Klein said. “The longer the shutdown goes on, the greater effects on the economy, particularly if businesses can’t reopen.”

It’s also important to note that, whatever you call it, not everyone will experience the economic fallout in the same ways. For some people, it will be catastrophic. For others, it will be an inconvenience. Older, low-income, and homeless people and those in other vulnerable communities will also likely experience the economic crisis in more harmful ways, regardless of how the downturn is defined formally.

3) What does the stock market have to do with any of this?

The stock market has been all over the place amid the coronavirus crisis. Major indexes plunged as the gravity of the situation began to take hold in February and March, and stocks have become pretty volatile. But does it matter what the stock market does? Well, yes and no.

The stock market right now is signifying underlying turmoil in the economy. It can also be a leading indicator, albeit a noisy one, of where the economy might be headed, and amid coronavirus, its take appears to be ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. As stocks plunged at the takeoff of the crisis in the US, a lot of investors appear to have pulled out their money and parked it in cash, and uncertainty has created an enormous amount of volatility.

The stock market will likely start to recover before the economy does — that’s what happened after the financial crisis, when it turned up in March 2009 and the recession ended three months later in June — but we won’t know if or when that will be. What happens in the stock market can have a “wealth effect” as well that is largely behavioral — consumers spend more in a bull market. A small majority of Americans own stocks, but the richest Americans own most of the stocks.

But the average person shouldn’t focus too much on what’s going on in the markets, especially in the short term. There’s a saying from legendary investor Benjamin Graham that the market is a voting machine in the short run but a weighing machine in the long run. A stock’s particular price might be up or down on a given day, but ultimately, the underlying fundamentals of a business are what matters.

“What we know about anything that is bought and sold is that price is dictated by price and demand. What helps determine stock prices over the long run, of course, is earnings, it’s fundamentals, but in the short run, panic can create very significant mispricing,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.

There have also been questions about whether the US could halt stock market trading altogether, beyond the temporary “circuit breaker” stops that are triggered when stocks drop too much. Greg Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics, told me that theoretically it could — after all, there are stock market holidays — but that wouldn’t necessarily solve the volatility problem. “The question is, what happens when it reopens?” he said. “You close the market, reopen it, and it falls by 30 percent, was it worth it?”

4) If I have investments, like a 401(k), what should I be doing?

The best advice right now on what to do on your investments, per finance experts, might also be the hardest to follow: Do nothing.

“Most people are horrible at making long-term investment decisions generally, and that’s exacerbated when they try to make decisions under emotionally intense circumstances,” said Zach Teutsch, a financial adviser at Values Added Financial.

While it may be tempting to look at your 401(k) or stock portfolio right now, it might not paint a pretty picture and could prompt you to make decisions you might later regret. That’s part of what happened in 2008, Hooper said, when average Americans paid too much attention to the stock market, pulled their money out, and then missed out when stocks started to come back. “One of the biggest mistakes in the financial crisis was that the average American did focus on it, and many of them changed their asset allocations as a result,” she said.

Remember, before the current crisis, Americans were in the midst of the longest economic expansion in US history and a multi-year bull market.

To be sure, the advice around this changes with age — people who have years before they plan to retire can wait out the recovery, while those close to or in retirement might not be able to. The experts I spoke with said older people have hopefully shifted their investments toward less risky places — more bonds than stocks, for example — with age. (There’s a reason your 401(k) investment plan often has a target retirement date attached to it.)

For younger people, or those with some money to spare, down markets can be a good time to get in. If you can afford to kick up your 401(k) contributions, consider it. Or if you have cash on hand, a lot of stocks might be trading at a discount. “If you needed to buy a new pair of shoes and all the shoes in the world were 40 percent off, you wouldn’t say, oh, no, there’s a terrible shoe crisis, you’d say, terrific, I can get the shoes I need for cheaper?” Teutsch said.

“Young people make a fortune on stock market crashes, because they’re adding every couple of weeks in bad markets at lower prices; you just don’t get to see it or appreciate it until years down the line,” said David Bahnsen, a portfolio manager and financial commentator.

It’s important to remember investing has inherent risks, there are no guarantees, things could get much worse before they get better, and the market is next to impossible to time — Warren Buffett once bet the S&P 500 would outperform a basket of hedge funds for a decade. And he won.

5) How does unemployment insurance work?

The first thing to know about unemployment insurance is that it’s a state-federal program that provides cash benefits, but in terms of administration, it goes through the state. In other words, it’s pretty patchy. So to apply, you need to go through your state unemployment agency, and guidelines for who qualifies and what benefits are awarded vary. You can find information about your state’s requirements and processes here.

First, we’ll go through the typical scenario for unemployment insurance, and then through the changes in the pandemic and how the stimulus package fortifies the program.

If you have been laid off or fired by an employer and have a “substantial history” of working, then you can apply to collect unemployment insurance benefits on a weekly basis.

Once you start the application process online or by phone, the unemployment insurance office contacts your employer to confirm that your explanation of why the job ended matches up. If the explanations for the separation are in agreement, then the claim generally moves forward quite quickly. If not, then there’s a dispute, and the state makes a judgment of what happened. It is worth noting that people who quit their jobs can also file for unemployment — for example, in cases of sexual harassment — but those workers are likelier to lose in the dispute.

Related Coronavirus could lead to the highest unemployment levels since the Great Depression

“When there are disputes over what happened, if people are laid off, they collect benefits 70 percent of the time. If there’s a dispute and they quit, they get benefits about 25 percent of the time,” said Wayne Vroman, a labor economist at the Urban Institute.

The amount you’re eligible to receive is calculated based on what you were earning at your job, and maximum and minimum amounts vary by state. Many states allow you to collect benefits for a maximum of 26 weeks, but again, that varies. Vroman estimates that the average across the system is about $385 a week. Across 52 weeks, that would add up to about $20,000 under the pre-stimulus system — in other words, it’s not a replacement for a full-time job, plus you can’t use it for a full year anyway. Typically, there are limits on how much you can earn while you’re collecting benefits. In other words, no side gigs or freelancing.

Unemployment insurance is funded through payroll taxes paid by employers, and when there are a lot of claims, states can run out of money to pay benefits out. During the last recession, three dozen states wound up having to borrow from the federal government to cover unemployment insurance.

Because so many people are filing for unemployment amid coronavirus, doing so is extra challenging right now, and many state offices are overwhelmed. That may translate to delays for those filing.

The late March stimulus package puts unemployment insurance on steroids. It includes a $600 per week increase in unemployment benefits on top of state benefits for four months. It also expands unemployment to people who aren’t usually covered — gig workers, freelancers, contractors, the self-employed, and workers who are furloughed or have reduced hours — and allows for 13 weeks to be tacked on to each state’s maximum.

“If you lose your job, if your hours are cut, and even if it doesn’t feel like you’ve lost your job but you’ve been put on a zero-hour schedule, you can still apply for unemployment benefits even if your employer tells you you can’t,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation.

Vox’s Dylan Matthews has an explainer on how the stimulus bill changes unemployment insurance.

6) How do I pay for health care if I’m laid off?

In the United States, health coverage is tied to employment. Now, large parts of the economy have been shut down in order to respond to a health crisis, resulting in millions of Americans losing their jobs in the middle of said health crisis and, therefore, many of them losing their health insurance.

“The joy of picking — or keeping — your health insurance is really predicated on you having a job,” said Mike Konczal, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute.

Linda Blumberg, a health system expert at the Urban Institute, talked Vox through what to do if you are laid off and lose your employer-based insurance.

The first step for people who can afford it is to look into the potential for getting COBRA coverage, which basically means you get to hold on to your insurance but pay for it yourself. But COBRA can be expensive and translate to thousands of dollars in premiums. For people whose incomes have fallen significantly, and especially for those who live in Medicaid expansion states, Medicaid is another place to look. You can see if you qualify for Medicaid in your state based on your income here. For children, you can look into CHIP as well.

People who lose their jobs can also enroll in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces for a certain period, because losing your health insurance, as well as having a baby or getting married, is considered a “qualifying event.” And there, you may be eligible for subsidies, too. Blumberg cautioned people should be thorough in looking for options for enrollment, and they should presume their loss of income is going to persist when inputting information into the system. “If for some reason they get their job back or their hours come back up, they can then report that at the time and have the subsidy reduced,” she said.

Even if you’re not eligible for a subsidy, it’s an especially critical time to have health insurance, given the coronavirus outbreak.

Blumberg warned against nongovernment, non-marketplace plans and “short-term, limited-duration” plans allowed under the Trump administration. “Those other policies, it’s very difficult, often, to figure out what’s excluded from them,” she said. “Be very cautious of something that looks too good to be true.”

For those who are uninsured already, it’s worth noting that some states have reopened their marketplaces in light of the crisis, so you may be able to get insurance now. “Debt is better than dead,” Blumberg said.

Vox’s Dylan Scott has an explainer on health insurance amid coronavirus and the different mechanisms for coverage. He also notes that the CDC said in a statement to Vox that the agency believes it has the legal authority to cover Covid-19 testing and treatment, in collaboration with other federal and local agencies. In a separate statement, a CDC spokesperson told Vox that there are “provisions that allocate funding for testing and treatment of the uninsured, which will continue to be announced” and noted that federally qualified health centers are an important resource for those who lack insurance.

7) What other mechanisms are there to help me if I can’t pay my bills?

Beyond unemployment and health insurance, there are other ways out there to help people make ends meet.

For example, there are multiple options for food assistance, including SNAP benefits (more commonly known as food stamps) and specific services for pregnant or postpartum women and children and seniors. In the case of food stamps, they’re managed by the states, and you can find a directory here. Food stamps, like other assistance programs, are pegged to your income.

“It’s possible that you have, even with unemployment insurance, an income that’s low enough that you would be eligible for SNAP,” Vroman said.

You can also find an outline of government benefits here.

Stettner advised that people should start signing up for benefits and assistance programs as soon as they can. “Start the process, because it can take some time. Don’t wait around to the last minute to reach out for help,” he said. He added it’s also worth reaching out to utility companies in the case of hardships to see if they’ll work with you on a plan to pay your bills. (The same may apply for rent payments or mortgages, too.)

Unfortunately, a lot of the safety net in the US has been whittled down over the years. “It’s for the most needy people in our society, so we don’t have a lot of room for people just getting by,” Rouse said.

8) How does the stimulus work, and what else is the government doing to help the economy?

On March 27, the president signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, the CARES Act, to help stabilize and boost the American economy in the time of coronavirus. Vox’s Li Zhou and Ella Nilsen have a full explainer of what’s in the bill, and here’s a brief overview:

A $500 billion loan program for businesses to be administered by the Treasury Department. Basically, a bailout fund for big business.

Boosted unemployment insurance that increases benefits by $600 a week per four months and expands who can apply for and collect benefits

Funds for hospitals, medical equipment, and protection for health care workers totaling $150 billion, $1 billion of which will go to hospitals, $1 billion to the Indian Health Service, and the rest to increased medical equipment capacity

Roughly $150 billion in aid to state and local governments, including $5 billion for tribal governments

About $377 billion in small business loans

The other plank of the stimulus, which has gotten perhaps the most attention is the direct payments to be sent to Americans across the country — in other words, those checks from the government you’ve probably been hearing about. (Vox’s Dylan Matthews has an explainer on the stimulus checks.)

Single adults who make up to $75,000 annually will get a one-time $1,200 check, and married couples who make up to $150,000 will receive $2,400. The government will also distribute $500 per child. The payments decrease as incomes go up and phase out by $99,000 for singles and $198,000 for couples. The calculations will be made using 2019 taxes for those who have filed (the deadline is now July 15) and 2018 taxes for those who have not. There are several calculators online you can use to figure out how much you’ll receive.

For those who don’t file taxes because they earned so little they weren’t required to, collecting the cash will be more complex. The IRS says people will need to file a “simple tax return” with basic information to collect money, and low-income taxpayers, older people, Social Security recipients, some veterans, and individuals who otherwise don’t need to file a tax return will not owe tax. Note that people in households with members who are unauthorized immigrants may be ineligible for the direct payments.

Beyond the stimulus bill, Congress has passed two other coronavirus-related pieces of legislation, and the Federal Reserve has taken steps to help stabilize markets and the economy. Democrats are pushing for a fourth coronavirus bill, but thus far, it’s not clear how much buy-in there is from Republicans.

As for what else the government could be doing, the answer is plenty, if there’s political will. Americans are facing a health and economic crisis of staggering proportions, and the greater risk is doing too little than in doing too much. Vox’s Matt Yglesias recently laid out some possibilities:

The US needs to take the analogy of wartime mobilization that’s been used by many leaders much more seriously and deliver trillions more in tax cuts and spending increases to stimulate demand. Much of that spending should be aimed at mobilizing workers and industry to provide the goods and services the US needs to continue coping with a virus that, even if successfully contained, is not going to vanish soon. To cope with the twin crises of economics and public health, the US will need substantial investment in the production of personal protective equipment for health care workers, but may also need production of masks and gloves for the public. It will need a huge infusion of funds to state and local governments so they can continue to provide — even expand — needed services. It will need medical research in spades, and we’ll need income support for households and businesses as they struggle to adapt to a new world of doing things in less efficient, more socially distant ways. And to support it all, the US needs a creative and flexible Federal Reserve willing to adopt a wartime mentality to finance.

“Does anybody regret how much debt we went into to win World War II?” said Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan and former Obama administration official. “People rarely complain about how much Congress is spending to fight a war, and they need to be thinking about that right now as we fight this pandemic.”

9) Which industries are being hit hardest by this?

Not every person — or every sector — is being impacted equally by the coronavirus crisis.

“This recession is going to be, for some people, more devastating than the financial crisis, for some less,” Klein said. “This one is going to start further down on the income spectrum.”

Restaurants, bars, stores, and nonessential businesses have been forced to close across much of the country. Airlines have seen an enormous decline in business, as has the travel and hospitality industry across the board. Schools have been shut down and live entertainment brought to a stop.

The stimulus bill is meant to bring some relief to both small businesses and major corporations, which both got bailout funds as part of the $2.2 trillion package. But, again, it really depends how long this lasts to see how hard the economy to be hit.

Ultimately, businesses and industries translate to people, as in, workers, and the workers who will be hardest hit by layoffs and shutdowns are those who can’t afford it. According to estimates from the US Private Sector Job Quality Index, more than 37 million jobs in the US are vulnerable to layoffs in the near term, 35 million of which are considered low-income.

There will likely also be disparities by race and ethnicity.

“We know that blacks, Latinx, and native people, in terms of race and ethnicity, they have lower levels of reserves, and we also know that their employment is more precarious than that of white people,” said Darrick Hamilton, the executive director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University.

10) How can I spend money to help?

If you have extra cash on hand right now and aren’t concerned about parting ways with it, there are plenty of things to do with it to try to help — order delivery from local restaurants and grocery stores, or buy gift certificates for local businesses that you can use at a later date. Amazon is one company not worried about its business right now, so maybe get toilet paper from the market down the street instead. Tip the delivery person generously. Instead of ordering through a delivery app, try calling the restaurant instead. Lower-wage service workers are going to be the ones hurt the most the fastest.

“A lot of small businesses that tend to work on fairly small margins to begin with are going to be very hard hit,” Rouse said.

If you employ people, such as a child care provider or cleaning service, you can always keep paying them, even if you ask them not to come.

There are plenty of charities willing to take your money, including GiveDirectly, which is providing cash assistance to families. You can also contact local food banks and other social service organizations to figure out how you can help. Another grim reality is that there are plenty of GoFundMe accounts set up to provide economic and medical aid.

But the fact of the matter is, there is only so much that private individuals can do.

“Fundamentally, this needs to be a government solution. Individual acts of charity or trying to keep the economy afloat are not sufficient at this moment,” Konczal said. “The recession is ultimately a collective problem, and the government will be the one who determines what happens to small business, self-employed people, and so on down the line.”

11) When will things get better? Is there a chance any of this brings about positive change to the economy?

At the moment, the likeliest scenario is that the economy gets better when the coronavirus crisis gets better, and unfortunately, nobody knows when that will be. As Dartmouth College economist Bruce Sacerdote put it, “It’s all about getting the damn virus under control.”

There has been some debate about whether the “cure” — as in the economic shutdown — is worse than the disease that is coronavirus. And some people have suggested government officials open the economy back up and start to ease restrictions on social distancing even before the health plank of this is under control. But is it really worth sacrificing tens of thousands of people so that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will go back up? And is it really likely that with a deadly virus spreading, people are going to be eager to go eat at the diner down the street?

Billionaire Bill Gates recently weighed in: “It’s very tough to say to people, ‘Hey, keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner. We want you to keep spending because there’s maybe a politician who thinks GDP growth is all that counts.’”

Vox’s Ezra Klein also recently did a deep dive:

You can suppress the virus now and deal with a terrible economy six months from now, or you can wait two more months to suppress the virus, find yourself forced into yet more extreme quarantine measures because the virus is pervasive and the death toll overwhelming, and find yourself in an even more horrendous economy on the other side.

So for now Americans are in a waiting game with the virus, and once that’s under control, the recovery will depend on the mitigation measures the US has taken and will take. “The debate is if we end up in a V-shape or a U-shape recovery, and anyone who pretends to have the answer to that is wrong,” Bahnsen said.

As to whether this will bring about positive change in the economy, it’s hard to tell. On the one hand, policies and government actions that would have seemed almost unimaginable just weeks or months ago — a check going out to nearly every American household, expanding unemployment insurance — are now a reality. And in such a scenario where so many Americans are losing health coverage in the time they need it most, it has to make some at least think about the value of Medicare-for-all, or at the very least, a public health insurance option. The Great Depression resulted in a dramatic expansion of the social safety net.

“We’re considering this use of public power to address our calamity in ways that the public imagination didn’t consider in the past. The sobering reality is that it’s not enough,” Hamilton said. “You can’t tell people that this stuff is impossible, because it happened.”

This could also foster a discussion about how Americans treat and think about the workers deemed “essential” during times of crisis, which includes not only doctors and nurses but also home health care workers, grocery store clerks, and service staff.

On the other hand, there’s always a tendency to revert to the mean, and recessions and economic crises don’t usually make Americans more generous. “In general, recessions make people very zero-sum and very hesitant to want to collectively provide security. We saw that in the Great Recession,” Konczal said. “We should not understand this as an obviously political moment.”",vox,https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/4/2/21201905/coronavirus-economic-crisis-recession-depression-stimulus-checks-covid-19

Part of the Pandemic Issue of The Highlight, our home for ambitious stories that explain our world.

The flaws in America’s health system have been evident for decades to anyone who cared to look, but the coronavirus pandemic has left no more room for doubt: People will die because the US refuses to treat health care as a public good and a universal right. They already are.

Our decentralized system, with independent providers and many different payers, was not nimble in responding to this stealthy pathogen. These problems weren’t the only reason more than half a million people in the United States have contracted Covid-19 and tens of thousands have died. But America was particularly fertile ground for a virus to run wild.

Only in America could a man and daughter placed under mandatory government quarantine then be hit with a $4,000 hospital bill. Only in America could somebody without health insurance — a situation, all on its own, foreign to other rich countries — receive a bill for Covid-19 treatment that tops $30,000. Only in America would a dying patient ask in his final breaths who will pay for the care that could not prevent his death. The US is the richest country in the world, and yet millions are uninsured or have insufficient benefits. It has fewer hospital beds, doctors, and nurses per capita than its economic peers.

Related Dylan Scott answers 9 key questions about universal health care around the world

The response to the current pandemic has been portrayed by President Trump and journalists as a war-like mobilization effort. Historically, wars lead to reconstruction. But for decades, the US’s slipshod system has resisted efforts to build a more universal and socialized model, with the government guaranteeing coverage for everyone and overseeing costs for the whole country, as seen everywhere else in the developed world. Even the coronavirus may not be traumatic enough to change that underlying reality.

Nonetheless, the pandemic will leave its mark on US health care long after the immediate threat passes. There is no doubt about that. Vulnerable hospitals are being drained of their reserves, patients are embracing health care from the socially distant safety of home, and Congress and the White House are desperately trying to patch up holes in America’s safety net.

Change is already well underway.

Some hospitals will probably close. A lot of primary care doctors could also be in trouble.

Hospitals of every type — private and public, urban and rural — are paying a heavy price to Covid-19. Not only are they trying to keep their patients and doctors healthy despite a shortage of supplies, but many have canceled or postponed elective surgeries, such as heart surgery or even cancer treatments. Those procedures typically account for much of their annual revenue, and without it, hospitals are laying off staff (temporarily, for now) to keep afloat.

Rural hospitals especially depend on outpatient services for much of their revenue — about three-quarters of it on average, according to a Chartis Center on Rural Health analysis. Most of those services are now on hold. Making matters worse, hospitals in rural communities generally had only a month’s worth of cash on hand for a crisis like this — and the extension of social distancing guidelines until at least the end of April will “increase the likelihood that we will see rural hospitals run out of cash,” the Chartis researchers wrote.

Before Covid-19 reached the US, one in four rural hospitals was already vulnerable to closure. Congress is funneling tens of billions of dollars to hospitals, and elective surgeries will resume at some point. But it still might not be enough to save some of these institutions.

“Even with all of that, there are going to be hospitals that close because of this,” says Susan Dentzer, senior policy fellow at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy.

The hospitals that will be best positioned to weather the crisis, on the other hand, are larger hospitals and those that are part of a system with several facilities.

“They typically are better capitalized and have more access to capital, have deeper reserves, and have endowments, and investments ... that while currently losing value, will almost certainly rebound,” says Karen Joynt Maddox, co-director of the Center for Health Economics and Policy at the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.

Primary care has also taken a massive, if less-noticed, drubbing during the pandemic, says Andy Slavitt, who oversaw the repair of HealthCare.gov in 2013 and later took over as Medicare and Medicaid administrator for President Obama. Patients are no longer going in for routine check-ups, and doctors aren’t reaping the income they normally would if they perform surgeries at a hospital.

“What happens to the structure of primary care? I fear you could end up with a very different-looking structure, with many [practices] shuttered. Many of them could be bought by insurance companies,” Slavitt says. “I could see a real decimating of independent primary care, and specialists impacted, as well.”

Telemedicine will finally go mainstream

The most obvious effect of the pandemic might paradoxically be the most mundane and the most significant. Telemedicine has struggled for years to realize its full potential, hindered by a combination of bad policies (limited Medicare coverage, states’ restrictions on practicing across state lines) and patients’ attachment to the old-fashioned “laying on of hands” kind of medicine.

But as government officials have sought to keep otherwise healthy seniors away from doctor’s offices and hospitals where they might be exposed to the coronavirus contagion, telehealth has experienced a boom. Those visits surged by 50 percent in March as social distancing went into full effect, and the total number of phone or video interactions is expected to exceed 1 billion total by year’s end. Estimates from 2019 had indicated only about one in 10 Americans were taking advantage of telehealth in the pre-pandemic era.

The Trump administration has relaxed Medicare rules — which previously only covered phone or video calls between doctors and seniors in rural areas — to pay for telehealth visits for all seniors insured through the program. Many private health insurers have done the same, boosting their payments for telemedicine consultations; previously, doctors would often be reimbursed less for virtual visits, discouraging its practice.

“In terms of many of the encounters people need for their daily lives and how many of them can be done through telehealth,” patients will begin to find telemedicine more convenient, says Nancy DeParle, who oversaw Medicare and Medicaid in the 1990s, when the strict rules for Medicare’s telehealth coverage were approved by Congress. “I just don’t see that going back.”

For a permanent paradigm shift, however, insurance companies will have to commit to continuing to covering telemedicine as they are now.

“If providers can get paid for it, then I think it’s reasonable you’ll see a huge bump,” Austin Frakt, a Boston University health economist, says. “It’s more convenient. People like it.”

We’ll invest more in public health preparedness and surveillance

Cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and related surveillance programs that monitor nascent outbreaks around the globe made it harder for the US to anticipate the coming crisis and develop plans to combat it. Congress tends to invest money in preparedness after a crisis like this; after the Zika virus outbreak of 2015, lawmakers set aside more emergency funding so federal outbreak response could launch quickly when the next pathogen arrived on the scene.

But those investments can also be fleeting. Public health tends to be first on the chopping block when the fiscal hawks take power; the cuts under the Trump administration are a grim reminder.

“One would hope that public health will be less of a neglected stepchild in our health care system coming out of this crisis,” says Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “At least for a while, there may be lasting investments in public health, until memory of the pandemic fades and we go back to underfunding it.”

Slavitt says the US should be investing in a new “sentinel system” that would help to detect emergent outbreaks where they are rising.

“We should end up building some more sophisticated intelligence systems to detect and monitor disease outbreaks,” he says.

The pandemic “is a case study in how it’s detrimental that we can’t do anything close to real-time surveillance,” Frakt says. “I could see movement. It’s very weedy. Nobody is going to go to a presidential debate and talk about how we need better data-sharing. But there are tech nerds who would love to figure this out.”

We could rethink how drugmakers and the federal government handle urgent needs

When Covid-19 appeared on the world stage, it triggered a race to find vaccines and treatments.

Academic researchers and for-profit pharmaceutical companies have rapidly scaled up clinical trials in search of breakthroughs that could alleviate the pandemic’s human toll and allow society to begin returning to normal.

But antiviral (and antibacterial) research investment historically has not been a priority for the major drugmakers whose participation is necessary for the mass production of any new medication. The Wall Street Journal reported Pfizer had to reestablish its antiviral research department for its Covid-19 work because the unit was disbanded in 2009. Novartis ended its antiviral and antibacterial research in 2018. The market has been dominated by Gilead (best known for its hepatitis-C cure) and GlaxoSmithKline.

One systemic review of the last 30 years of antiviral research found “only a few drugs were approved to treat acute viral infections” in that time.

“Antibiotics and antivirals are both areas that haven’t seen a tremendous amount of new drug development because the economic incentives haven’t justified significant R&D in this area,” says Caroline Pearson, senior fellow with NORC-University of Chicago. “I wonder if the FDA might consider new ways to encourage and promote pharmaceutical innovation in areas with high public health value but relatively lower market value.”

Another option, Pearson says, is for Congress to seek to expand federal authorities allowing the government to require drug and device manufacturers to produce drugs and supplies in an emergency.

There will be a push to expand health coverage

The elephant in this proverbial room is America’s embarrassingly high uninsured rate — above 10 percent before the crisis started and significantly higher now that millions are unemployed and losing their health insurance.

This is the fundamental immorality of US health care that the coronavirus has exposed again: How can anybody in the richest country in the world lack financial protection in a medical emergency?

Related Everybody Covered

A crisis like a worldwide pandemic historically has been an opportunity to repair such structural problems.

“Many of the biggest coverage expansions both in the US and in similar countries happened in the context of wars and social upheavals, as well as financial crises. One theory is that those circumstances redefine social solidarity, thus expanding views of the role of government,” says Cynthia Cox, director of the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker. “I think one factor that will determine the permanency of these changes is how long this disruption continues. The longer this goes on, the more likely this social solidarity becomes ingrained.”

Targeted fixes passed by Congress now cover the costs of Covid-19 testing and treatment for uninsured Americans, and some health insurers have waived cost-sharing for their customers during the pandemic. But that only raises the question: If those costs should be waived for an acute viral outbreak, then why should somebody diagnosed with cancer or heart disease have to fork over thousands of dollars for the care they need?

If Joe Biden becomes president, empowered with a Democratic Congress, he would likely have a mandate to pass another health reform that patches up holes revealed by the recent crisis. Any legislation would have to be negotiated in Congress, but during the campaign, Biden has proposed a new public insurance option that would be available to uninsured people, people who live in states that don’t expand Medicaid, and people who buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. People with employer-sponsored coverage would also be permitted to buy into the new government plan, if they choose.

But any significant expansion of health coverage probably depends on the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

“The answer to that question,” says Jacob Hacker, a Yale University political scientist who has studied how traumatic social events change political attitudes, “is gonna influence what’s possible in terms of large-scale health policy changes as much as anything else.”

Even if President Trump were to be reelected, it is conceivable that Republicans will have less appetite for their preferred proposals that pare back health coverage. Already, some GOP-led states have put Medicaid work requirements on hold, given the crisis and the surge of Medicaid enrollment resulting from high unemployment.

But more structural changes would require the right political environment. What nobody knows for sure, not even the people who have followed US health policy closely for years, is whether the coronavirus pandemic leads to any permanent political realignment.

“In more normal times, I’m a very staunch ‘nothing ever matters, nothing ever changes’ kinda guy,” Frakt says. “This is such a rare event with no comparable experience in 100 years, and I don’t think it’s fair to compare anything that happened 100 years ago to now. Basically, we don’t know.”

Toby Ord on existential risk, Donald Trump, and thinking in probabilities

April 9, 2020 | Oxford philosopher Toby Ord spent the early part of his career spearheading the effective altruism movement, founding Giving What We Can, and focusing his attention primarily on issue areas like global public health and extreme poverty. Ord’s new book The Precipice is about something entirely different: the biggest existential risks to the future of humanity. In it, he predicts that humanity has approximately a 1 in 6 chance of going completely extinct by the end of the 21st century. The coronavirus pandemic is a reminder that tail risk is real. We always knew a zoological respiratory virus could become a global pandemic. But, collectively, we didn’t want to think about it, and so we didn’t. The result is the reality we live in now.

But for all the current moment’s horror, there are worse risks than coronavirus out there. One silver lining of the current crisis might be that it gets us to take them seriously, and avert them before they become unstoppable. That’s what Ord’s book is about, and it is, in a strange way, a comfort.

This, then, is a conversation about the risks that threaten humanity’s future, and what we can do about them. It’s a conversation about thinking in probabilities, about the ethics of taking future human lives seriously, about how we weigh the risks we don’t yet understand.

Elizabeth Warren has a plan for this, too

April 6, 2020 | In January, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the first presidential candidate to release a plan for combatting coronavirus. In March, she released a second plan. Days later, with the scale of economic damage increasing, she released a third. Warren’s proposals track the spread of the virus: from a problem happening elsewhere and demanding a surge in global health resources to a pandemic happening here, demanding not just a public health response, but an all-out effort to save the US economy. Warren’s penchant for planning stands in particular stark contrast to this administration, which still has not released a clear coronavirus plan. There is no document you can download, no web site you can visit, that details our national strategy to slow the disease and rebuild the economy.

So I asked Warren to return to the show to explain what the plan should be, given the cold reality we face. We discussed what, specifically, the federal government should do; the roots of the testing debacle; her idea for mobilizing the economy around building affordable housing; why she thinks that this is exactly the right time to cancel student loan debt; why America spends so much money preparing for war and so little defending itself against pandemics and climate change; whether she thinks the Democratic primary focused on the wrong issues; and how this crisis is making a grim mockery of Ronald Reagan’s old saw about “the scariest words in the English language.”

What social solidarity demands of us in a pandemic

April 2, 2020 | There is no doubt that social distancing is the best way to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But the efficacy of social distancing (or really any other public health measure) relies on something much deeper and harder to measure: social solidarity.

“Solidarity,” writes Eric Klinenberg, “motivates us to promote public health, not just our own personal security. It keeps us from hoarding medicine, toughing out a cold in the workplace or sending a sick child to school. It compels us to let a ship of stranded people dock in our safe harbors, to knock on our older neighbor’s door.” Klinenberg, a sociologist by trade, is the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. His first book, Heat Wave, found that social connection was, at times, literally the difference between life and death during Chicago’s 1995 heat wave. Since then, he’s spent his career studying trends in American social life, from the rise of adults living alone to the importance of “social infrastructure” in holding together our civic bonds.

This conversation is about what happens when a country mired in a mythos of individualism collides with a pandemic that demands social solidarity and collective sacrifice. It’s about preventing an epidemic of loneliness and social isolation from overwhelming the most vulnerable among us. We discuss the underlying social trends that predated coronavirus, what kind of leadership it takes to actually bring people together, the irony of asking young people and essential workers to sacrifice for the rest of us, whether there’s an opportunity to build a different kind of society in the aftermath of Covid-19, and much more.

Coronavirus has pushed US-China relations to their worst point since Mao

March 30, 2020 | The COVID-19 pandemic is a grim reminder that the worst really can happen. Tail risk is real risk. Political leaders fumble, miscalculate, and bluster into avoidable disaster. And even as we try to deal with this catastrophe, the seeds of another are sprouting.

The US-China relationship will define geopolitics in the 21st century. If we collapse into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism, the results could be hellish. And we are, right now, collapsing into rivalry, conflict, and politically opportunistic nationalism.

The Trump administration, and key congressional Republicans, are calling COVID-19 “the Chinese virus,” and trying to gin up tensions to distract from their domestic failures. Chinese government officials, beset by their own domestic problems, are claiming the US military brought the virus to China. The US-China relationship was in a bad way six months ago, but this is a new level of threat.

Evan Osnos covers the US-China relationship for the New Yorker, and is author of the National Book Award winner, The Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New China. In this conversation, we discuss the past, present and future of the US-China relationship. What are the chances of armed conflict? What might deescalation look like? And we know what the US wants — what, in truth, does China want?

Is the cure worse than the disease?

March 26, 2020 | “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself!” That was President Donald Trump, this week, explaining why he was thinking about lifting coronavirus guidelines earlier than public-health experts recommended. The “cure,” in this case, is social distancing, and the mass economic stoppage it forces. The problem, of course, is COVID-19, and the millions of deaths it could cause.

This is a debate that needs to be taken seriously. Slowing coronavirus will impose real costs, and immense suffering, on society. Are those costs worth it? This is the most important public policy question right now. And if the discussion isn’t had well, then it will be had, as we’re already seeing, poorly, and dangerously.

March 25, 2020 | Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya talks with Recode’s Kara Swisher about how long it will take to recover from the coronavirus crisis, its impact on startups, and how the US government should and will react — including by tracking individuals via their technology and repatriating cash from tech companies like Apple. Palihapitiya says businesses should make sure they have at least 36 months worth of cash on hand to weather this recession and its slow recovery period and predicts the US will need to devote an entire year’s GDP to combat covid-19. He criticizes the corporate “shenanigans” that will make economic recovery harder says he’s done investing for at least nine months, because anyone trying to do deals now will be “decapitated.” Plus: What we can all learn right now from the histories of the Great Depression and the 2008 financial crisis, and which industries will come out of this crisis stronger than before?

An economic crisis like we’ve never seen

March 23, 2020 | “What is happening,” writes Annie Lowrey, “is a shock to the American economy more sudden and severe than anyone alive has ever experienced.”

It’s also different from what anyone alive has ever experienced. For many of us, the Great Recession is the closest analogue — but it’s not analogous at all. There, the economy’s potential was unchanged, but financial markets were in crisis. Here, we are purposefully freezing economic activity in order to slow a public health crisis. Early data suggests the economic crisis is going to far exceed any single week or quarter of the financial crisis. Multiple economists have told Ezra Klein that the nearest analogy to what we’re going through is the economy during World War II.

“I have a secret advantage when trying to understand moments of economic upheaval. I’m married to Annie Lowrey,” writes Ezra Klein. “I can give you the bio — staff writer at the Atlantic, author of Give People Money (which is proving particularly prophetic and influential right now) — but suffice to say she’s one of the clearest and most brilliant economic thinkers I know. Her viral piece on the affordability crisis is crucial for understanding what the economy really looked like before Covid-19, and she’s been doing some of the best work on the way Covid-19 will worsen the economic problems we had and create a slew of new ones. But this isn’t just a conversation about crisis. It’s also a conversation about how to respond. I wouldn’t call it hopeful — we’re not there yet. But constructive.”

March 19, 2020 | Ron Klain served as the chief of staff to vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden. In 2014, President Barack Obama tapped him to lead the administration’s response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. He successfully oversaw a hellishly complex effort preparing domestically for an outbreak and surging health resources onto another continent to contain the disease.

But Klain is quick to say that the coronavirus is a harder challenge even than Ebola. The economy is in free fall. Entire cities have been told to shelter in place. And there’s no telling how long any of this will last. In this conversation, Klain answers Ezra Klein’s questions about the disease and how to respond to it, as well as questions many of you submitted.

She also discusses CDC director Anthony Fauci’s “unimpeachable” credibility vs. President Trump’s trust problem, how Vice President Pence is doing at the helm of the coronavirus task force, and how this period could have a bigger impact on Trump’s re-election chances than previous crises. Plus: Who is actually running things at the White House right now, and can Trump operate his campaign without mass rallies?

March 13, 2020 | Epidemic co-host Ron Klain, who led the White House’s ebola response under President Obama, talks to Recode’s Kara Swisher about how the COVID-19 outbreak will strain America’s healthcare system; how President Trump downplayed the crisis, rattling public confidence and delaying the country’s response; and the way people who work in the gig economy — including Uber drivers and food delivery workers — will be especially hurt by the situation. He also discusses the logic behind travel bans and limits of their efficacy, why it’s impossible for the US to completely cut itself off from China, and what Trump didn’t say in his Oval Office address, but should have. Klain, an adviser and former chief of staff to Joe Biden, also talks about the ex-vice president’s surprisingly successful presidential campaign and how it’s reckoning with Biden’s history of verbal flubs.

"['Dylan Scott Rani Molla', 'Dylan Scott', 'Rani Molla', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-03-13,How the US stacks up to other countries in confirmed coronavirus cases,"The United States has the most confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world, with more than 11 times the number of cases reported in China and more than four times as many cases as Italy and Spain, other epicenters of this global outbreak. Confirmed infections in the US make up nearly a third of the world’s coronavirus cases.

America started off testing people for the coronavirus at a slower rate than most other developed countries, but the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US has risen more quickly than the country’s peers abroad. We don’t yet know the full extent of the outbreak, but America remains a focal point of the coronavirus pandemic.

The US health system was less prepared for a pandemic than those of other wealthy nations. A high uninsured rate, high out-of-pocket health care costs, and low medical system capacity combined to make the country more vulnerable to a pathogen before the coronavirus ever came to our shores. America’s lax response in the early days of the outbreak only compounded those structural problems.

“Everyone working in this space would agree that no matter how you measure it, the US is far behind on this,” Jen Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told Vox in mid-March of the initial coronavirus response.

Here’s how the number of confirmed cases in the US compares to select other countries, based on days since each country reached 100 confirmed cases, according to data we analyzed from the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus dashboard.

Note that the chart uses a log scale, meaning that the Y-axis goes up in equal distances between 100, 1,000, and 10,000 to mimic the exponential rate at which a contagion like the coronavirus spreads.

Here’s that same chart on a traditional linear scale.

As of April 27, the Johns Hopkins research data shows more than 2.9 million confirmed cases worldwide, about 965,000 of which were in the US. The actual number of cases is likely much higher. About 207,000 people have died across the world from Covid-19, including nearly 55,000 in the United States. There are signs that social distancing measures in the US are making an impact, but the country surpassed Iran, Italy, and China to have the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.

As the Wall Street Journal has reported, Chinese health officials have acknowledged they did not include 1,500 asymptomatic cases in their previous national tallies, but said that such cases would be counted starting on April 1. Based on reporting by the South China Morning Post, China may be undercounting asymptomatic cases to an even greater degree. But remember, most countries’ numbers are probably low because people who have no or mild symptoms often don’t get tested.

Case numbers in the US have also far outpaced places like South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore, where the governments mobilized more quickly and certain cultural norms (like mask-wearing) may have helped slow the spread. (Early signs of a second wave of cases have recently appeared in Singapore, however; this was a fear among public health experts who worried societies would be too quick to reopen.)

Japan’s case numbers have started rising more quickly in recent weeks, and the government has been criticized over not having enough tests to properly judge the number of cases.

As America implements dramatic measures to control the spread of Covid-19, with schools and businesses closing and general social distancing underway, the country is still struggling to understand the full scope of the outbreak because of the slow start of testing. It has undeniably hindered the US response.

“The testing failure is putting additional strain on our already challenged health system,” Cynthia Cox, director of the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, said in March. “The combination of all of these factors will make the US worse off than similar countries.”

Testing is not only important because it gets people diagnosed and appropriate treatment if they have an infection, it also establishes how widespread a virus actually is. Experts know the size of the problem, they know the rate at which people are being hospitalized or dying, and they can follow its movements.

But the United States faltered in rolling out coronavirus tests, initially putting America behind its economic peers in tracing the outbreak. A manufacturing problem with the test kits that were initially sent out in the field, and a delay in approving commercial tests, set the nation back in stopping or slowing down Covid-19.

Even as testing capacity has ramped up in the US, as of April 27, America is still lagging behind other places in the world hit hardest by the virus in the share of its population being tested. The US has tested about far fewer people per million residents as Italy, a focal point of Europe’s outbreak, and Germany, considered a model of rapid and widespread testing.

There have been nearly 5.4 million tests conducted in the US for its population of 329 million, but the number of tests per capita conducted varies greatly by state.

The US has finally started to catch up to the rest of the developed world in responding to Covid-19. But as case numbers and deaths continue to increase, we’re still learning the full scope of the crisis.

"['Dylan Scott Rani Molla', 'Dylan Scott', 'Rani Molla', 'Apr']",2020-03-26,"Coronavirus chart: Number of cases, deaths, and tests by US state","The coronavirus outbreak first erupted in the United States in Washington state, and while New York has become the American epicenter of the pandemic, there are Covid-19 cases in all 50 states.

The pathogen is spreading across the country, along with positive tests and death counts. Getting control over the outbreak depends on each state’s ability to engineer an effective response, to slow the virus down and eventually contain it. What plans for physical distancing are put in the place — and how well are they followed? Can the state health system survive an influx of infected patients?

“Each region has its own socio-cultural reasons that contribute to the rate of spread and its own approach to dealing with that rate of spread,” says Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington who has been modeling infectious disease outbreaks for 20 years.

For now, the coronavirus appears more concentrated in urban centers, primarily New York City and its surrounding suburbs. That’s where the virus first landed and it could flourish in those places because they are densely packed with people, exposing them to a stealthy virus that takes several days for its symptoms to show up. Metro centers all over the US — Detroit, New Orleans, Miami, and many more — continue to see increases in coronavirus cases.

At the same time, the US is still almost certainly undertesting in other parts of the country. To give one example, Connecticut has done more than twice as many tests per capita as Texas and Georgia. Yet all three states have roughly the same number of positive test results, despite the latter two testing far fewer people per capita. Such a high positive test rate suggests that the real number of cases may be much larger than the official count.

As of April 27, New York has the most confirmed cases (about 288,000) and it has also conducted the second most tests per million people (about 41,000), having only been recently surpassed by Rhode Island.

Here’s how states, territories, and Washington, DC, compare based on the number of confirmed cases and deaths, and the number of people tested, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. Using the latest available Census Bureau numbers, we also calculated the number of tests per million people in a population, to give a better sense of a state’s efforts in tracking the disease.

(Note: We have updated the chart to display “tests conducted” instead of “people tested” because some states are reporting a raw count of the number of tests performed, which may include multiple tests for the same person.)

State health systems have different capacities to handle the surge of Covid-19 cases. Some started the crisis with higher uninsured rates, particularly in the South, because they have refused to expand Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act. Now millions of workers are newly unemployed as the coronavirus economic crisis sets in, suddenly uninsured during a public health emergency. Some states have younger and healthier populations; others are older. Certain states have more hospital beds per capita than their neighbors, and funding for public health differs considerably among states.

“One thing that always strikes me about the American system is effectively there are, like, 51 American systems,” Ellen Nolte, professor of health services and systems research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Vox last year.

The coronavirus pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge for states

New York, Washington, and California were forced early on to take measures to curtail the Covid-19 outbreak, and some states quickly followed their lead. Others were reluctant to impose strict distancing guidelines, worried about the imposition on daily life and especially businesses. As of April 20, at least 42 states had statewide stay-at-home directives.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo moved to expand hospital capacity in his state; he also waived out-of-pocket costs for health insurance, and the state put out a call for retired doctors to volunteer their services to avert a hospital staffing shortfall. New York set up “containment zones” to contain local hot spots, where all the area schools were closed, and religious gatherings and other large gatherings were halted. The state has also radically reorganized its hospitals into effectively one statewide system, in the hopes of better managing staff, supplies, and patients. However, New York, like many other states, initially hesitated to put out “stay at home” guidance, before instituting that policy on March 22.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee quickly ordered the state’s schools to close until the last week of April after the Everett nursing home outbreak. He also appeared uneasy about issuing a statewide “stay at home” order, though he’s since done so. California Gov. Gavin Newsom was the first governor to issue such an order (after several major metropolitan areas in his state had taken that step), and he helped convince some of the big tech companies in his state to donate much-needed protective masks for medical staff.

Other governors adopted more lax attitudes toward the crisis, at least initially. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt tweeted out (and then deleted) a picture of him and his family eating at a restaurant even though other states were starting to shut down nonessential businesses. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at first shrugged off calls to issue a stay-at-home order after pictures of college-age beachgoers in his state stirred up fears they would become vectors for spreading a virus that is generally milder for young people. On April 1, he changed his mind and finally issued a statewide stay-at-home order. However, some beaches in the state have already started reopen as of April 20.

Hospitals are relying on states to increase the health system’s capacity of hospital beds, ICUs, and ventilators, as well as the personnel to staff them. States, in turn, will need support from the federal government, as their tax revenue takes a hit in the economic downturn. The stimulus bill passed by Congress provides money to hospitals as well as funding for states, although experts say much more is needed.

The relationship between the states and the White House has been a fickle one in the crisis. President Donald Trump has insinuated states should treat his administration kindly in order to win more federal support. Governors have contradicted Trump over his speculation in mid-March that Americans could return to normal life soon; he has somewhat backed off such claims. And many states say that they are still not getting enough supplies from the federal government to make up for expected shortfalls.

States are depending on federal aid to increase testing capacity, too, so they can actually trace the outbreak. New York so far is testing people at the highest rate of any state, while there are other states with a growing number of cases (like Texas and Georgia) where the testing rates still remain low.

"['Umair Irfan', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-03-30,How Covid-19 immunity testing can help people get back to work,"Testing to see who has the Covid-19 coronavirus has become one of the most crucial elements of slowing the global pandemic. And it may also hold the key to a return to normal.

“Everyone staying home is just a very blunt measure. That’s what you say when you’ve got really nothing else,” Emily Gurley, an associate scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told NPR. “Being able to test folks is really the linchpin in getting beyond what we’re doing now.”

In particular, serological tests, also known as “immunity tests,” for antibodies to the virus could reveal the true extent of the pandemic and help scientists answer basic questions about Covid-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2: How many people have been infected with the virus? Who may have spread it without knowing it? Why do some people have mild illness while others become gravely ill? How deadly is the disease? What tactics are actually working to slow its spread?

Serological tests could also potentially allow people who have immunity to return to work. That could be a huge boost to front-line health workers who may have been exposed to the virus but are desperately needed back in action.

Countries are now racing to acquire more of these tests. The United Kingdom ordered 3.5 million serological tests. Germany is considering using these tests to issue immunity certificates to people who have survived Covid-19.

In the US, the Food and Drug Administration on April 2 granted first approval to a serological test for Covid-19, with an Emergency Use Authorization. The test, made by Cellex, can generate results in as little as 15 minutes. Other companies and labs are jostling to develop serological tests in the US as well.

Related 6 things to know about the coronavirus testing disaster in the US

But scientists are also still learning how long immunity from Covid-19 can last and whether there is a chance that people could be reinfected. Filling in these blanks will be critical to the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Let’s walk through what we know.

Serological tests can reveal who has defeated Covid-19 and may now be immune

In patients who have recovered from Covid-19 or may have carried the virus without realizing it, a serological test can show who carries antibodies, even if the virus is no longer present. Antibodies are proteins that help the immune system identify and eliminate threats. Once they’re made, they help the body neutralize future infections from the same threat.

Establishing who is immune is important for figuring out who can safely return to work. For example, health workers are facing staffing shortages as Covid-19 spreads through their ranks, and serological tests may soon become necessary to keep hospitals and clinics running.

These tests are also a forensic tool, tracing the spread of the virus through a population. This can solve some of the unknowns of the Covid-19 outbreak and help scientists get ahead of the next pandemic. Countries like China and Singapore have already used serological tests for contact tracing to see how the virus has spread.

Serological tests use blood serum, the liquid part of blood, excluding cells and clotting proteins. Even though SARS-CoV-2 isn’t typically present in blood, an infection causes white blood cells to make antibody proteins that help the immune system identify viruses and stop them, or mark infected cells for destruction.

Although these proteins can be detected in the bloodstream and blood serum, it can take several days for someone to make these antibodies after an infection. So a serological test isn’t always useful for finding an active infection — and can yield a false negative, showing that someone doesn’t have the virus when they actually do. The results of these tests can also be trickier to interpret than results from the more common RT-PCR tests used to diagnose Covid-19, which detect the virus’s genetic material.

But antibodies can linger long after an infection has faded. That’s why serological tests for antibodies can identify past cases of the virus.

“That’s a great screening tool to figure out what proportion of our patient population had it or what proportion of our hospital staff has been exposed to it,” said David Pride, associate director of microbiology at the University of California San Diego.

Researchers are also studying how to use antibodies collected from previously infected patients to treat current cases of Covid-19. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is now allowing doctors to use blood plasma from recovered patients that contains antibodies to treat emergency cases of the disease, and serological tests can identify potential antibody donors. (Potential donors can sign up here.)

Serological tests are also cheaper to run than RT-PCR. An RT-PCR test costs about $50 at Medicare rates. A serological test can be less than $10.

It’s faster, too, using techniques like ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Here, a tiny piece of the virus is stuck to a plate. If an antibody to the virus is present in a blood sample, it will attach to the virus on the plate. Then a second antibody with an enzyme attached will stick to the virus antibody. The enzyme then accelerates a reaction that changes the color of the solution, indicating that the patient has at some point mounted an immune response to the virus.

There are other serological testing systems in development as well, including a fingerstick test that can deliver results in as few as 10 minutes. Meanwhile, RT-PCR tests can take several hours to run, and if samples have to be shipped to an outside lab, it can take days to get results. (The FDA recently approved a new rapid genetic test that can give a positive result in five minutes.)

However, as with RT-PCR tests, serological tests are also facing supply shortages and bottlenecks. And right now, the main task for combating the Covid-19 outbreak is figuring out who currently has the virus, which makes RT-PCR tests the priority. But as the US heads deeper into the pandemic, serological tests will become essential to finding a path out.

Researchers still aren’t sure how long Covid-19 immunity will last

If serological tests are deployed even more broadly, health officials can trace the spread of the illness. Coupled with widespread RT-PCR tests to find active cases of Covid-19, scientists could identify hot spots, and governments can more precisely target their tactics. Rather than blanket shelter-in-place orders, officials could see which cities, neighborhoods, and people are most at risk and start to relax quarantines, curfews, and other control measures in some areas.

Widespread testing alongside social distancing can slow the spread of the virus and eventually help restart idled economies and bring countries closer to where they were before the pandemic.

But there are some caveats.

To safely return to work, a patient would have to ensure that they have immunity and that they are no longer spreading the virus. Since a serological test can only confirm the former, a patient may still need an additional RT-PCR test to establish the latter. That is, they need to test positive for immunity and negative for the virus itself.

SARS-CoV-2 is also a new virus, so researchers aren’t certain how long immunity will last. The virus could mutate and render past immunity ineffective, although scientists have found that it is mutating slowly, indicating that the protection from a past infection is likely to be effective for a while.

“You’re going to have some degree of durable immunity,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Doctor Mike YouTube show. “It may not be 50 years, but it’s certainly going to be a matter of a few years.”

Resolving these questions about immunity is essential to determining whether it’s safe to go back to work, particularly in health care. “We need to check to make sure the protection is real before doing that on a large scale, but I do think [serological testing] will be an important part of the strategy because we’ll need to keep health care workers in action,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University.

The possibility of protection from the pandemic — and a test to show it — should also not be an incentive to try to get infected in the hope of building immunity. Covid-19 is a dangerous illness. While older people are generally most at risk, people of all ages have become seriously ill and have died from it. Infected people can also spread the virus to others more at risk, even if the infected person has no symptoms.

And there are still not nearly enough materials for either widespread RT-PCR or serological testing. There are also critical shortages in protective equipment for medical staff conducting these tests. That’s making hospitals and clinics think carefully about who needs to be tested right now and moving serological tests for people who aren’t sick anymore to the back burner.

Getting the amount of testing needed to end the pandemic is also no trivial task. It would demand an extraordinary coordinated effort of not just deploying tests but training a workforce to do them. In addition, people would have to maintain strict social distancing measures until all the requisite testing is completed, which could take months. “It would take a sort of moonshot-level effort,” wrote Vox’s Brian Resnick.

As manufacturers ramp up production to meet the surging testing demand, these supply shortfalls will likely fade. But in the meantime, some difficult decisions lie ahead.

“In the US, we’re not accustomed to being in a resource-limited environment, but when it comes to testing for Covid, we still are in a resource-limited environment,” Pride said.

Ultimately, the threat will fade when enough people are immune to the virus that it can no longer spread easily, or if pockets of Covid-19 are contained until they burn out. Getting immunity from exposure is a costly and dangerous approach, so the best strategy remains not getting infected in the first place and buying time until researchers can develop and deploy a vaccine. And in the meantime, test, test, test.",vox,https://www.vox.com/2020/3/30/21186822/immunity-to-covid-19-test-coronavirus-rt-pcr-antibody
"['Dylan Scott', 'Mar']",2020-03-23,"The Covid-19 risks for different age groups, explained","Nobody’s risk is zero when it comes to the Covid-19 coronavirus.

Anybody can get sick in this pandemic. But different people have different risks of getting severe symptoms that require hospitalization or intensive care — and the chances of dying from Covid-19 vary widely across age groups.

The conventional wisdom says kids and young people may be fine even if they get infected, with the risk of a case being more severe increasing with age. It’s the older folks, we need to worry about, this thinking says, given death rates reach 20 percent or more among people 80 and older. Public health experts have seemed exasperated by the social media images of younger Americans who continue to socialize or even take a spring break vacation, worried that the perception a young person has little to fear from the coronavirus has given them a false sense of security.

To be clear, nobody should feel invulnerable to the coronavirus. Young people are going to contract the disease, a not-insignificant percentage of them are going to get very sick, and a smaller number will die. The rates of severe and deadly cases might not be nearly as high as the older generations that we are worried about, but the data already show that age alone does not make you invincible.

There are two other things about risk to keep in mind about who’s at higher risk. One, there is some indication that men could be at a higher risk of severe symptoms and death than women. In the initial Wuhan, China, outbreak, for example, men were dying at a notably higher rate than women. We’ve seen the same trend in Italy. But we will need more research and data to be sure about the effect of gender on a patient’s prognosis.

Second, we know that people who have underlying medical conditions face higher odds of getting really sick or dying from Covid-19, particularly those with heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, lung disease, and cancer. Having one or more of those conditions increases a person’s risk of severe symptoms beyond what their age alone would suggest.

To review everything we know on age and the Covid-19 risk, I’m going to draw from a few sources that we’ll keep coming back to: the World Health Organization report on the initial Wuhan outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new report on the early cases in the US, Spain’s breakdown of its pandemic by age group, and two Vox articles on the risks to children and older people.

One caveat: Overall infection rates increase with age (kids seeing lower infection rates, seniors higher). But it’s hard to know if that’s because young people actually get infected less or simply because they are less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention, and so their cases are being underreported. A second caveat: The data we have so far are preliminary, and what we know will change as more information from different countries’ outbreaks come in.

We’ll therefore stick to the data we have both good numerators and denominators for to answer an important question: What are your risks if you do get infected with the coronavirus?

Now let’s run through the different age groups and what we know about their risks.

Kids under 10 years old

The important stats on our youngest:

In Spain (with 28,600 total cases as of March 21, nearly as many as America’s 31,000), 34 out of the 129 cases among children 0 to 9 years old resulted in hospitalization, a rate of 26 percent; one child was put in the ICU (a 0.8 percent rate); and there have been no fatalities.

Across Italy, South Korea, and China, there have so far been no reported fatalities among children under 10 years old, according to data compiled from public sources by the widely followed anonymous biotech investor and former scientist who goes by AndyBiotech on Twitter.

#COVID19 Crude case fatality rate age distribution chart updated with Spain data



(Wish can add CDC prelim data here too only if they also use decade cutoff like everyone else...) pic.twitter.com/IpoRrL7p6i — Andy Biotech (@AndyBiotech) March 22, 2020

In the United States, there had been no ICU admittances or deaths reported among people under age 20 as of late last week; only a small percentage (1.6 percent) had been hospitalized. (I am using the lower bound of the CDC estimates because they cover all reported US cases, to be consistent with other data sources.)

So far, the data does bear out the idea that kids are not uniquely at risk of Covid-19, which is both surprising (because they usually are more vulnerable to the flu) and a relief.

But this age group obviously covers everybody from infants to kids approaching middle school. And we do have evidence that the youngest of these can see more severe cases than their older brothers and sisters in elementary school, as Vox’s Umair Irfan reported:

A study published March 16 in the journal Pediatrics of more than 2,100 children in China found that children of all ages were vulnerable to Covid-19, though the vast majority experienced mild symptoms, and some experienced none at all. A caveat for this study is that only one-third of the children in the sample were tested and confirmed to have the Covid-19 virus, SARS-CoV-2. The rest were presumptive Covid-19 cases, which means there’s a possibility that another pathogen could have caused the observed symptoms. Zeichner, who co-authored a commentary article about the findings, noted that the worst outcomes in children were often among infants. The study showed that about 30 percent of childhood Covid-19 cases deemed “severe” and more than half of Covid-19 cases deemed “critical” were among children less than 1 year old. Though the overall numbers were small — 7 infants had critical illness and 33 suffered severe illness — it did show that younger children faced a higher likelihood of more dangerous outcomes.

The other complication is that these younger people could still spread the disease to older generations, who are more at risk of critical illness.

Bottom line: Infants appear more vulnerable than toddlers and elementary school kids. Overall, though, only a small number of children under 10 years old are requiring hospitalization because of Covid-19 and, as of March 21, nobody in this age group has died.

Tweens and teens (10 to 19 years old)

The important stats on adolescents and just-turned-adults:

In Spain, out of 221 cases for people 10 to 19, 15 of them have been hospitalized, a 7 percent rate; none have ended up in intensive care. One person in this age range has died, a 0.4 percent fatality rate.

Italy and South Korea have reported no fatalities for this group; China reports that 0.2 percent of cases for these young people end in death.

In the US, there had been no ICU admittances or deaths reported among people under 20 as of late last week; only a small percentage (1.6 percent) had been hospitalized.

With the younger generations, same as the older generations, underlying medical conditions add to a person’s vulnerability. But the absence of health problems does not mean the absence of risk: CNN reported Sunday on a 12-year-old girl in Atlanta with Covid-19 who has no known health conditions and who is nevertheless on a ventilator.

Bottom line: Older kids and teenagers may be more resilient than their younger peers in some ways (lower hospitalization and ICU rates in Spain, the only country we have data to separate the 0-9 and 10-19 cohorts), but there is still a small risk of serious complications or death.

Young adults (20 to 29 years old)

The important stats on young adults:

In Spain, out of 1,285 cases for people 20 to 29 (a much bigger sample size than we have for children), 183 of them have been hospitalized, a 14 percent rate; eight have ended up in intensive care, a 0.6 percent rate, and four people in this age range have died, a 0.3 percent fatality rate.

Italy and South Korea have reported no fatalities for this group; China reports that 0.2 percent of cases for these young people end in death.

The CDC covers a huge 20-44 age range in its data, but here’s what we know about that entire group: 14.3 percent hospitalized, 2 percent in the ICU, and 0.1 percent fatality rate.

Bottom line: We are seeing a higher hospitalization rate among young adults compared to the teens directly behind them in age, and comparatively more of them wind up in the ICU. Fatality rates are still low, but deaths do happen. The trends that will carry through the rest of this article — the older you get, the higher the risk — are starting to show up.

Adults up to middle age (30 to 49 years old)

The important stats on this working-age population:

In Spain, out of 5,127 cases from this cohort, 1,028 people have been hospitalized, a 20 percent rate; 55 went to the ICU, a 1.1 percent rate; and 12 people ages 30 to 49 have died, a 0.2 percent fatality rate.

Italy (0.3 percent death rate), China (0.2 percent), and South Korea (0.1 percent) have reported deaths in this age range.

As mentioned above, the CDC covers one huge 20-44 age range in its report, but here’s what we know about that group: 14.3 percent hospitalized, 2 percent in the ICU, and 0.1 percent fatality rate.

For people 45 to 54, the CDC reports 21.2 percent have been hospitalized, 5.4 percent were put in the ICU, and 0.5 percent have died.

To prevent these numbers from becoming too abstract, the story of Jeffrey Ghazarian is a sad warning for this population. Ghazarian, a 34-year-old who lived near Los Angeles, died Thursday from Covid-19 after five days on a ventilator. He was a cancer survivor, which fits with what we know about the disease: People with past health problems and compromised immune systems are more at risk.

Bottom line: For this demographic, a significant number of people are being hospitalized, upward of one in five cases. And those final numbers from the CDC are a good example of how risk can vary within these age groups: Odds of hospitalization, intensive care, and death seem to increase from one’s early 40s to late 40s. We’ve seen the same trend in Spain: The rates of hospitalization jumped from 17 percent for ages 30 to 39 to 23 percent for ages 40 to 49.

People nearing retirement age (50 to 69 years old)

The important stats on the people entering their golden years:

In Spain, out of 6,045 cases from this cohort, 2,166 people have been hospitalized, a 36 percent hospitalization rate; 221 went to the ICU, a 3.7 percent rate; and 83 people ages 50 to 69 have died, a 1.4 percent fatality rate.

Taken collectively, Italy, China, and South Korea have reported fatality rates from 0.4 percent up to 3.6 percent for people in this group.

For people 45 to 54, the CDC reports 21.2 percent have been hospitalized, 5.4 percent were put in the ICU, and 0.5 percent have died. For people 55 to 64, 20.5 percent have been hospitalized, 4.7 percent ended up in the ICU, and 1.4 percent died. For the oldest folks in this group, ages 65 to 74, hospitalizations (28.6 percent), ICU stays (8.1 percent) and deaths (2.7 percent) continue to trend upward.

For folks over 50, the risks steadily grow, both due to their age and because they are more likely to have a preexisting medical condition that exacerbates their risk. Almost half of Americans ages 55 to 64 have at least one preexisting condition, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

That’s a problem when an unknown pathogen strikes. More from Vox’s Brian Resnick:

The longer we live, the more likely our cells are to replicate in dangerous ways, the more damage they accumulate, and the more likely our organs are to stop functioning normally. This puts us at a heightened risk of chronic health conditions, like cancer or diabetes. Along with already weakened immune systems, these underlying diseases can make it harder for the body to ward off infections. The takeaway: It’s not just age alone that endangers people; it’s being older with one or more chronic diseases. Among the 105 patients who had died in Italy as of March 4, two-thirds had three or more preexisting conditions. The most common was hypertension, followed by ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. These chronic illnesses can leave organs degraded and more vulnerable to infection. Additionally, the treatments for these conditions can suppress the immune system, leaving the body susceptible to pathogens.

Bottom line: All of these folks are in the high-risk category. A substantial minority are being hospitalized, and a handful of people out of every 100 have died. The dangers increase if they have heart or lung problems, or if they have diabetes or a cancer diagnosis.

Seniors (70 years old and older)

The important stats on older individuals:

In Spain, out of 6,152 cases from this group, 3,388 people have been hospitalized, a 55 percent hospitalization rate; 199 went to the ICU, a 3.2 percent rate; and 705 people ages 70 and older have died, a 11.4 percent fatality rate.

Italy, China, and South Korea have reported fatality rates from 6.2 percent up to 20.2 percent for people in this age range.

I’ll use the 75-and-older numbers from the CDC: For ages 75 to 84, hospitalizations (30.5 percent), ICU stays (10.5 percent), and deaths (4.3 percent) are already high, and the key metrics go up even higher for people 85 and older; 31.3 percent hospitalized, 6.3 percent in the ICU, 10.4 percent fatality rate.

One note: The ICU stays could be lower for the oldest people if the disease progresses so quickly that they don’t even have an opportunity for intensive care.

Bottom line: There is no need to belabor the point, as I think one thing most people know about Covid-19 is it hurts older people the most. The data bears this out: People in this age group are the most likely to be hospitalized and to ultimately die during this pandemic.

For the rest of us, the risk is less severe but far from zero, and every person should be mindful of how their current health might make them more susceptible. And all of us, no matter our age or health status, should do our part to protect the most vulnerable through social distancing.

"['Julia Belluz Umair Irfan Brian Resnick', 'Julia Belluz', 'Umair Irfan', 'Brian Resnick', 'Mar']",2020-03-04,A guide to the vaccines and drugs that could fight coronavirus,"The global race to make a vaccine and treatment for the Covid-19 coronavirus is well underway as the epicenter of the pandemic is now shifting toward the United States.

The virus has already shown it has the potential to kill — particularly vulnerable groups, like older adults and people with underlying health conditions. But people of all ages are at risk of severe illness and death.

The virus is also highly contagious. And there’s a lot we don’t know about it since it was only discovered mere months ago. For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a global public health emergency back in January (and later said it had become a pandemic).

As this new virus makes its way around the globe, the public health tools we have to control its spread are blunt, often not implemented correctly or fast enough. They’re already having big economic and social side effects. Health officials are relying on tactics like quarantines and social distancing while hospitals (which fear equipment shortages) are using oxygen and fever reducers, like ibuprofen, to treat people.

The good news is that the world is in better shape to come up with a medical solution — a coronavirus drug or vaccine — than it’s ever been. Within a couple of weeks of discovering the outbreak, Chinese scientists sequenced the virus’s genome and shared it with the world. The structure of the virus was revealed shortly thereafter. These developments now hold the key to creating what could end this outbreak for good: vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments.

Many of the vaccine and drug development efforts are building on past efforts to deal with other viral outbreaks, including coronaviruses like MERS and SARS — which means researchers had a head start with Covid-19. In the US, a phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine is already underway.

The bad news is that these efforts will likely face the perennial hurdles of medical innovation: long timelines (particularly for vaccines, since they’re used in healthy people), fickle funding, and changing political priorities. On March 6, international researchers put out an “urgent call” to raise $2 billion for vaccine development against Covid-19. It’s all a reminder that we need a better way to keep up consistent pressure against sporadic but deadly threats.

In the meantime, here’s the state of play for some of the most promising approaches. We’ll walk through key vaccines and drugs in development, the new technologies and collaborations behind them, and how far they are from reaching humans.

We’ll be updating this story as progress evolves.

There are dozens of vaccines in the pipeline to prevent Covid-19. These are some of the most promising ones.

One of the most important funders of international vaccine research is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, a public-private partnership that launched in 2017. Its raison d’être: to award grants for swift vaccine development targeting emerging threats that the pharmaceutical industry might otherwise ignore.

Only three months into this outbreak, CEPI is a large part of why there are already dozens of Covid-19 vaccine candidates making their way through animal and human trials as well as platforms to develop more. US government funding — in particular through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) — has also been streamlining the process for many manufacturers.

As public health efforts try to mitigate the spread of disease, it may take a vaccine to bring the outbreak under control. “If we can have an effective vaccine that is rolled out to the population at some point,” Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University, says, “the level of [infection] in the population then would probably drop precipitously.” The relatively slow mutation rate of the coronavirus so far may be a promising sign for vaccine research. Among the potential vaccines with the most buzz:

1) After MERS and SARS emerged, “It was clear coronaviruses were going to be a threat,” says Barney Graham, the deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Over the past few years, NIAID has been studying the molecular structure of this family of viruses, he says, and devising plans to quickly create vaccines against them.

It’s paid off: A CEPI-funded contender is mRNA-1273, from the NIAID and the biotech company Moderna. Theirs is an mRNA vaccine; mRNA is short for “messenger ribonucleic acid,” the molecules that instruct cells to make particular proteins.

This mRNA technology injects snippets of genetic code into a person’s muscle so that the muscle cells start producing the viral protein themselves. “The mRNA is just delivering the instructions for how your cell can make that [virus] protein,” Graham explained. “And once it’s made, then the immune system takes over and does its thing.”

A phase 1 clinical trial to demonstrate the safety of the vaccine is now underway.

The hope is that mRNA vaccines can be more potent than older approaches and lead to rapid, cheaper manufacturing. And because they don’t use live viruses, they’re potentially safer, too. So if approved, mRNA-1273 would be the first mRNA vaccine licensed in humans and mark the debut of a new, fast-to-develop vaccine technology.

Graham points out that the speed of development isn’t an accident: The National Institutes for Health (NIH) has been preparing for coronaviruses. But if “it was some other type of virus, like a bunyavirus or an arenavirus, something that we did not have as much information on ... we could not have responded this fast,” he says.

2) The biotech company Inovio Pharmaceuticals and its partner Beijing Advaccine Biotechnology were awarded a CEPI grant to develop a Covid-19 vaccine candidate, INO-4800. Inovio is notable because it already has a promising (and CEPI-supported) vaccine for MERS — a coronavirus that’s closely related to Covid-19 — going through human trials.

INO-4800 is in the preclinical phase of testing, meaning it hasn’t yet been tried in humans. The company is aiming to test on people later this year. It also uses a “DNA vaccine” approach. The company also received a $5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a device to deliver the vaccine through the skin.

3) The biotech firm CureVac is also working on a CEPI-funded mRNA vaccine, which would work in a similar fashion as the one being developed by Moderna and NIAID. “We are very confident that we will be able to develop a potent vaccine candidate within a few months,” said CureVac CEO Daniel Menichella in a press release.

That confidence comes from the fact that the company has tried a rabies mRNA vaccine in humans. “We were able to immunize all participants with a very low dose,” Menichella said. “On this basis, we are working intensively to achieve a very low dose for the CoV vaccine as well.” But this candidate is still in the preclinical phase of development.

Company officials also said that they expect their vaccine could be available as soon as this fall. CureVac recently made headlines when the Welt am Sonntag reported that President Trump offered the company money to move to the United States and gain exclusive rights to their work. German government officials confirmed the reports, but the US government and CureVac denied that such an offer was ever made.

4) Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen is exploring a less experimental approach to prevent the Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. With help from BARDA, it’s developing a vector-based vaccine, a method that led to the effective Ebola vaccine.

Essentially, it’s built off a nonreplicating virus (or viral vector) with a bit of coronavirus genetics added in. The vaccine would be injected into a person’s muscle, where the injected virus generates a protein. If that protein folds correctly (and achieves the correct shape), it can provoke an immune response. And the virus that’s used as a vector cannot get anyone sick — though this vaccine is still in the preclinical research phase, meaning it hasn’t yet been tried in humans. “We expect to start human trials in autumn of this year,” says Hanneke Schuitemaker, head of viral vaccine discovery at Janssen. The company expects to begin phase 1 trials of its vaccine before the end of the year.

5) Yet another approach comes from Sanofi Pasteur, which is also working with BARDA. Instead of taking a viral protein produced in the human body and injecting it, Sanofi is manufacturing a version of the protein. Sanofi already produces a flu vaccine in this manner, so it could potentially ramp up production of a coronavirus vaccine quickly — though the company expects it might be some time before it could be tested in people. “We hope to be in human [trials] within a year,” said Sanofi’s head of global vaccine research and development John Shiver.

6) GSK is sharing its proprietary adjuvants — ingredients added to some vaccines to boost their effectiveness — with a Chinese biotech company called Clover Biopharmaceuticals and the University of Queensland, through a collaboration with CEPI. These partnerships aim to get Covid-19 vaccine candidates “into clinical testing as quickly as possible,” GSK said in a statement.

7) With the help of an NIH grant a few years back, the vaccine research center at Baylor College of Medicine developed a vaccine candidate for SARS — again, another coronavirus that’s closely related to the virus that causes Covid-19. In 2016, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research even manufactured the shot. But “by then, interest in a coronavirus vaccine was basically gone,” Baylor’s Peter Hotez explained. So the vaccine never made its way through clinical trials and onto the market.

When Hotez and his colleagues began watching the Covid-19 outbreak unfold in early January, they realized there might be a new use for their vaccine. SARS and the novel coronavirus are “about 80 percent similar in their amino acid and genetic code, and they bind to the same receptor,” Hotez said. He and his colleagues are now appealing for funding to move the vaccine into phase one trials to test for safety in healthy volunteers. “Then you’d move it to an area where there’s community-level transmission” to test whether it makes a difference in stopping an outbreak.

What might slow down Covid-19 vaccine research

One of the hard-learned lessons of the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic, which killed 11,000 people, was that lifesaving vaccines for diseases affecting low-income people can languish in development. With Ebola, there had been work on experimental vaccines, but there was no business incentive for companies to actually complete the testing and produce one. The eventual development of an Ebola vaccine, approved in 2019, happened, thanks to generous donors and a big push by the WHO; it’s now being used to fight outbreaks.

These lessons drove the creation of CEPI. But Baylor’s experience shows that even if vaccine development for emerging threats has sped up dramatically, it’s still not quite fast enough. Ideally, we would have had a coronavirus vaccine ready in time for this outbreak and there would be a process in place to test in areas where the virus is circulating.

“Now that we’ve got all this technology, in theory, we should be able to make a vaccine in response to an imminent pandemic threat,” Hotez said. “But we still don’t have a lot of experience doing this.” So some of the dozens of vaccines in the pipeline are still going to be held back by delays in getting funding and getting approvals for testing, not to mention the ebb and flow of political interest.

Even without these challenges, developing vaccines is an intensely hard science. All the different approaches are trying to do the same thing: Introduce a tiny piece of coronavirus protein into the human body so that the immune system can learn what a coronavirus “looks” like. If a vaccine can tell the immune system to seek out and destroy this protein, the body is immune to the virus. But actually finding the perfect immune trigger — and then proving it is safe enough to use in healthy people — can take years.

That brings us to an additional stumbling block all these vaccines will face: a problem called immune enhancement, or vaccine enhancement. It was discovered in the 1960s when a vaccine candidate for a different respiratory virus — RSV — was being tested and researchers found it actually worsened the disease after people were exposed to the virus, even killing two test subjects. “This soured a generation of research into RSV vaccines,” Hotez said. And it raised questions about whether other vaccines for respiratory diseases might pose the same threat. While there’s now a push to understand the immune enhancement phenomenon, it might pose a problem for new Covid-19 vaccines.

“Everyone talks about [having a vaccine] 18 months or a year from now,” Hotez said. “We just have to proceed with caution and convince the regulators [in the US, the Food and Drug Administration] this isn’t going to be an issue.”

Still, if a vaccine arrives a year or so from now, it could still be useful. “We don’t know what’s going to happen with this virus,” Graham says. “We don’t know if it will go away like SARS did, or we don’t know if it will be coming back around every winter. So our job is to try to develop interventions that could be used if it gets worse. ... We need ways of protecting ourselves.”

Funding could be another obstacle. Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, said that there have been fresh cash injections into the vaccine research effort, but they aren’t enough. “[T]hese funds will be fully allocated by the end of March and without immediate additional financial contributions the vaccine programs we have begun will not be able to progress and ultimately will not deliver the vaccines that the world needs,” he wrote in a statement Friday.

Research on new drugs is underway to treat people who have contracted Covid-19

It could be a year or more before a Covid-19 vaccine is cleared for use. But that doesn’t mean other treatments won’t arise sooner.

As with vaccines, scientists are investigating dozens of drugs to treat Covid-19, building on past work treating other viruses and diseases, from SARS to HIV. The current approach is a bit like throwing lots of things at a wall and seeing what sticks. According to the Milken Institute, there are 75 treatment protocols for Covid-19 in development.

Some of these drugs and treatments have already gone through human testing, so they may arrive sooner than if researchers started designing new drugs from scratch.

There are a couple of main drug-based treatment approaches to Covid-19: attacking the virus directly and boosting the body’s immune response. Let’s walk through them.

1) Antivirals: These are drugs that fight off viral infections, usually by attacking the viruses themselves.

By attacking different parts of the virus, antiviral compounds can prevent a virus from entering cells or interfere with its reproduction, slowing or stopping an infection, explained Pei-Yong Shi, a biochemistry and molecular biology professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch.

One new drug that might be able to do this is called remdesivir, under development by Gilead Sciences. There are five different clinical trials underway for the drug. In the United States, remdesivir is undergoing a clinical trial at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, sponsored by NIAID. And it has already been administered under compassionate-use guidelines that allow some patients to use experimental drugs if no other options are left.

Remdesivir works by interrupting the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it copies its genetic material, which in turn stops the virus from reproducing. What’s clever about remdesivir is that it disrupts the virus but not the human cell, so it has a targeted effect.

The WHO is bullish about this approach. “There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy, and that’s remdesivir,” said WHO Assistant Director-General Bruce Aylward at a press conference. But remdesivir still needs to go through clinical trials before it can be used widely.

2) Immune system boosters: The human body has powerful built-in infection fighters, but a virus can still cause a lot of damage and spread to other people before the body can spool up its natural defenses. So researchers are investigating treatments that help the human immune system quickly lock on to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and mount a counterattack.

When a virus invades the body, a type of white blood cell known as a B cell generates antibodies. These are proteins that bind to specific parts of an invader or an infected cell, flagging the target for destruction by other cells. They can also block a virus from infecting a host cell.

Regeneron, a biotech company, is developing a set of therapeutic antibodies that can be administered to a patient and help their immune system counteract SARS-CoV-2 right away. These antibodies are generated from mice engineered to have genetically human immune systems, which means they produce human antibodies.

“It’s a very robust approach,” said Christos Kyratsous, vice president for infectious disease research and viral vector technologies at Regeneron.

Kyratsous added that the premade antibodies can be used prophylactically to prevent infection as well as therapeutically to treat the disease. The recipient can also retain protection from the virus for several months, but the treatment does not lead to lifelong immunity.

Right now, Regeneron is screening thousands of antibodies made from its engineered mice to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is aiming to start human trials by the end of the summer. The company is also partnering with Sanofi in phase 2 and 3 trials of an antibody drug known as sarilumab.

Vir Biotechnology is another company also investigating antibodies to treat Covid-19. But rather than drawing on engineered mice, the company is sorting through antibodies collected from people who survived related coronavirus infections like SARS.

Some old treatments may get a new life with Covid-19

There are trials underway using existing drugs as well. The key advantage of using an off-the-shelf therapy is that it’s already gone through testing to show it’s safe for human use and just needs to be tested for effectiveness against a new target. That means these treatments could potentially get deployed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus even faster than a new drug.

Japan is looking into using HIV drugs to treat Covid-19. These include antivirals like lopinavir and ritonavir. Doctors in Thailand reported success in treating patients using a combination of HIV drugs alongside oseltamivir, a drug sold under the brand name Tamiflu to treat influenza.

Like coronaviruses, HIV uses RNA as its genetic material, so these different viruses may be using similar enzymes to function and reproduce. It’s possible the drugs that inhibit HIV could do similar things to SARS-CoV-2 — but it’s not certain, which is why scientists are testing to see if they work on the new virus. A recent study in China in 199 patients cast doubt on the promise of HIV drugs, finding that “no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.”

There are also general treatments for viruses that are not specific to Covid-19, but they come with trade-offs.

To boost the immune system, physicians can use drugs like interferons. These are signaling proteins that serve as alarm bells in the body, activating an immune response. Interferons have been used to treat autoimmune diseases and viral hepatitis. “It’s a double-edged sword,” said Shi from the University of Texas Medical Branch. “If you activate them at the wrong time or if you activate it too much, it causes a lot of inflammation, which can cause disease.”

So to treat a virus, doctors have to balance attacking the virus directly without causing any collateral damage to the body, or they have to strengthen the body’s defenses while preventing the virus from causing even more harm. Interferons have already been used to treat Covid-19 cases in China, but it’s unclear how effective they are on their own.

Some scientists think interferons combined with other drugs could be more effective against Covid-19. For instance, researchers in the United Kingdom are investigating interferon treatments coupled with anti-inflammatory medicines. In Saudi Arabia, scientists are testing interferons alongside lopinavir and ritonavir.

On the other hand, Covid-19 can trigger an immune system overreaction, leading to dangerous symptoms like severe lung inflammation, so scientists are investigating drugs that can tamp down the immune response. For example, China’s National Health Commission said that it is testing the anti-arthritis drug Actemra in Covid-19 patients to help treat inflammation from the virus.

Recently, anti-malaria drugs have received a lot of attention as potential Covid-19 treatments. In particular, President Trump took to Twitter to promote hydroxychloroquine, a derivative of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine may have anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, but testing has been sparse. A French study seemed to show that it shortened the recovery time in patients, but the drug was only administered to 26 patients in the study, and the trial wasn’t randomized. A randomized trial of hydroxychloroquine in China did not find a difference in recovery rates.

Hydroxychloroquine can also have dangerous cardiac and psychiatric side effects, so it isn’t something that can be simply given to everyone. And Trump’s boosting has helped fuel a shortage of the drug, which is also needed by patients to treat arthritis and lupus. Nonetheless, there are at least 13 clinical trials of the drug to treat Covid-19 that are pending or underway.

We need to start preparing for the next big, deadly outbreak now

The race to develop a treatment and vaccine for the novel coronavirus illustrates just how much science builds on past efforts, like the responses to MERS, SARS, and the Ebola virus.

But it also shows that persistent research attention matters even after an outbreak dissipates. A disease that spreads to thousands of people in days can do a lot of damage in the months or years it takes to create a treatment or vaccine, so an existing body of research can save lives.

“What needs to be done for the viruses that we don’t understand as well — that still have pandemic potential — is just fill in the database, to study those viruses, understand the structure of their proteins, understand the way antibodies work against them,” NIAID’s Graham says. At the very least, researchers and drug companies should “develop one prototype [vaccine] within each [viral] group all the way through a clinical trial. And then either it goes on the shelf or it’s recorded in the literature, so that you have that information available when things like this happen.”

Again, with Covid-19, research on treatment and vaccines had a head start: Because of the SARS and MERS outbreaks, scientists had previously dedicated themselves to studying how to build a coronavirus vaccine and treat the diseases.

However, preparing for a future epidemic is a tough sell to a for-profit drug company, even with new funders like CEPI. Companies must invest huge amounts of money and time in coming up with a response and then somehow recover that investment, even if the outbreak never arrives. Planning for pandemics takes political will and foresight.

“At least in most of the world, vaccine and antiviral development is done by for-profit companies,” Vincent Racaniello, the Columbia University immunologist, says. “They will not make a vaccine or an antiviral if they don’t have a sufficient market. And I think that that’s the wrong model. And so we have to change their models. We have to have government-supported research that will bring the vaccine to a point where if there is an outbreak, it can be quickly manufactured and used.”",vox,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/4/21154590/coronavirus-vaccine-treatment-covid-19-drug-cure
"['German Lopez', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,"The 4 plans to end social distancing, explained","If there is any agreement with the coronavirus pandemic, it’s this: Everyone is looking forward to ending social distancing and reopening the economy. President Donald Trump has loudly advocated for it, sometimes in defiance of public health experts. Other officials, like former Vice President Joe Biden, and experts agree that they want the economy to reopen, but they’re more cautious with making any promises about when and how.

Several experts and think tanks have released plans for what this might look like. The right-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and left-leaning Center for American Progress (CAP) put out detailed proposals. Nobel Prize–winning economist Paul Romer did as well. Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, which has worked on bioethics issues in the past, has put out several white papers about confronting the crisis. (Biden also laid out a plan in a New York Times op-ed, but it’s pretty vague.)

The plans are grim. They do suggest there’s a way back to normal life, but they make clear that it will likely take a long, uncomfortable, even painful time to get there. The CAP and AEI plans in particular suggest the US won’t be able to fully end social distancing until 12 to 18 months from now — with a true end requiring a vaccine or some other therapeutic to prevent or treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

To put it in terms my colleague Ezra Klein did, these plans are a bit scary. They show the US is likely stuck with some level of social distancing for at least months and possibly a year or more. That’s going to lead to a significantly weaker economy, with lost wages and higher levels of unemployment. That’s less time people can spend with friends and family. It’s less time with favorite hobbies and activities. It’s a formula for a loneliness epidemic.

But that’s all necessary, according to the plans, to slow and halt the spread of the coronavirus, which could lead to hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths if left uncontrolled.

While they differ in important ways, the plans suggest the US will go through the crisis in three phases:

In the first, and current, phase, America does widespread social distancing. The idea is the country needs broad, untargeted physical distancing measures to flatten the curve of new coronavirus cases. Until cases drop to a certain point, it’s just not safe to go out. This will likely last at least a few more weeks.

In the second phase, the US relies on surveillance, particularly more widely available testing, to ease social distancing measures. This would not mean a total end to physical distancing. The proposals mostly still call for prohibiting large gatherings and limiting socializing for vulnerable populations, such as those who are older or have compromised immune systems. There’s also a possibility the country or parts of it will have to go back to much more widespread social distancing if coronavirus cases increase. This phase could end up to 12 to 18 months from now.

In the third and last phase, a vaccine or other treatment that can reliably prevent or treat Covid-19 is developed. This allows the country to end social distancing entirely — though hopefully it establishes policies to better mitigate future disease outbreaks.

The plans, however, really begin to differ when it comes to how social distancing can be eased during that second phase — with different views on what kinds of tools should be used.

AEI and CAP lay out a framework through which the US phases into more testing and less social distancing, although CAP focuses much more on digital surveillance and contact tracing through a phone app. Harvard’s Safra Center explicitly calls for much more testing than CAP and AEI, but it also envisions a wartime-like mobilization that seeks to, in essence, make the best out of the country’s time social distancing. Romer’s plan is perhaps the most aggressive and single-minded on testing, calling for a scale of testing that no one else does.

A big caveat: These plans carry some assumptions, because there’s still a lot about Covid-19 and the coronavirus we simply don’t know. It’s uncertain if the virus could burn out in the months ahead or if hotter temperatures could slow its spread, which may cut the need for social distancing in the future. It’s unclear if people can become reinfected. Scientists are still figuring out all the ways the virus spreads and how deadly it truly is.

These plans, then, are about trying to put forward the best ideas with the best information available.

One thing they don’t address is political feasibility, and it’s not clear the US could actually follow any of these plans successfully. America has already struggled with its response to Covid-19 — failing to prepare for a pandemic, botching the rollout of tests, and suffering shortages in health care supplies. It’s been slow to fix these problems. Even as cases and deaths have grown, some leaders, including the president, have suggested that reopening the economy is a top priority. All these factors should cast doubt on how well any of this will be handled.

But the plans, at least, offer a way out — as grim and potentially unfeasible as the path may be.

The plans rely on extreme social distancing now and much more testing

The plans generally all say that extreme social distancing, as most parts of the US are practicing now, is needed to get Covid-19 cases low enough that it’s safe to resort to softer measures. The CAP plan even suggests the US needs to lock down further, arguing that all states should issue and enforce stay-at-home orders — which hasn’t happened so far — for 45 days.

The US needs extreme social distancing in part because it let the outbreak get so out of control before taking proper action. As a recent New York Times investigation concluded, Trump received warnings from his administration’s officials and experts for weeks that the outbreak was getting bad and required quick action, but he ignored such warnings. Some local and state officials, like New York’s, were also relatively slow to act. That amounted to, in one example, weeks in delays in getting coronavirus tests out — what the Times dubbed “the lost month.”

“What social distancing is doing is reversing — of course, with the cost of tens of thousands of Americans dying — the losses of two months of inaction,” Ashish Jha, the faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told me.

Every plan is clear that ending social distancing will require widespread testing — several times larger than the amount of testing the US is doing now — to track and control new clusters of outbreaks.

Though the plans agree on that, they differ on how much testing is needed. CAP doesn’t set an exact target, explaining “the number of tests needed should be guided by conditions on the ground.” AEI initially set a target of 750,000 per week, but the report’s authors clarified that was a bare minimum for when there are no more regional outbreaks and that as many as 3.8 million tests a week, or more than 500,000 a day, could be needed. The Safra Center suggests at least millions of tests a day. Romer is the most aggressive on testing, calling for more than 20 million tests a day.

The US is not there yet. Over the week of April 6, the country averaged about 150,000 tests per day. That’s an improvement from early March, when daily tests numbered below the dozens and later the hundreds. But the daily total hasn’t improved much compared with the week of March 30, when the US completed an average of more than 130,000 tests a day. And it’s a far cry from what any of these plans are calling for.

Early on, there were regulatory hurdles to testing people and private labs doing Covid-19 tests. Today, the problems are largely focused on supply: There aren’t enough swabs, test kits, reagents, personal protective equipment, staff, or machines to run the specific tests required, with different places experiencing one, some, or all of these problems on a day-to-day basis.

“Any one link in the chain of supply, any restriction in the chain of supply, can suddenly create a bottleneck,” Louise Serio, a spokesperson for the American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA), which represents the private labs, told me. “No labs have, really, the predictable, consistent access to all the supplies we need.”

The tests themselves could also be better. More accurate, faster tests and ones that check for potential immunity could all help if they become widely available. For now, these other kinds of tests are still in development or scarce.

According to all the plans, the US will need to fix its testing shortfall to safely ease social distancing anytime soon.

The plans differ on what comes after today’s social distancing

Even with more testing, the plans generally agree, or at least imply, that there will not be a return to normal anytime soon. At the very least, building the testing capacity required will take weeks if not months. Getting Covid-19 cases down to a safer level, without that testing, will require weeks if not months. The ultimate point of relief will be a vaccine, which is likely at least 12 to 18 months away.

Even once testing is scaled up, the CAP and AEI plans agree that the country will need at least some level of social distancing until a vaccine or effective treatment is developed. Both make it clear that, for instance, gatherings of 50 people or more should be restricted or banned, and people who are more vulnerable to coronavirus, like older adults or those with underlying health conditions, will have to remain vigilant and continue social distancing.

One way to think about the plans: They’d likely let you visit friends or family in small gatherings in their homes, but you probably won’t be able to go to a stadium, concert, or movie theater anytime soon, even with these plans in place. Restaurants and bars will likely operate at limited capacity. Schools could open as well, but with some physical distancing measures in place.

CAP’s proposed air travel rules are instructive: “Airline passengers must download the Contact Tracing app, confirm no close proximity to a positive case, and pass a fever check or show documentation of immunity from a serological test.” So air travel would technically be possible, but it would look very different from how it worked before Covid-19.

Still, all the plans do suggest easing social distancing to at least some degree as time goes on. The difference is how, exactly, this is done.

AEI calls for a soft reopening, with specific goals that have to be hit, including 14 days of a reduction in new reported coronavirus cases and enough capacity to test all people with Covid-19 symptoms, to move to the next phase. It suggests states will need to slowly build up contact tracing and health care capacity to ease social distancing. They should also be ready, the plan indicates, to shift back to stricter social distancing if Covid-19 cases rise. This gradual move toward less social distancing will play out state by state — and eventually the whole country should be able to fully open back up.

CAP calls for a soft reopening that similarly relies on more testing and health care capacity. But CAP puts more emphasis on digital surveillance, particularly a phone app that would track people’s movements to help notify them if they’ve come into contact with someone infected with the coronavirus. (Apple and Google recently partnered to help make such an app possible.) CAP acknowledges that this could raise significant civil liberties issues in the US, outlining several safeguards — like putting a nonprofit group in charge and automatically deleting data after 45 days — to mitigate those concerns.

The AEI and CAP plans also offer ideas for making it easier to social distance when it’s necessary. For example, they both suggest repurposing hotels, dormitories, and other currently unused living areas to offer space to people who don’t want to risk infecting family members when they get sick.

Generally, the AEI and CAP plans — which are the two plans put together primarily by public health experts — follow a similar structure: scale up testing and contact tracing; build health care capacity; ease social distancing over time; and remain vigilant for another wave of Covid-19 cases. They caution that at least some level of social distancing may be needed for as long as 18 months.

The Safra Center’s plan calls for millions of tests each day — far more than CAP or AEI explicitly propose — and a kind of wartime economic mobilization to confront the outbreak.

The goal of the mobilization is to minimize the economic damage of social distancing, do things to help take on the outbreak now, and address longstanding social and public health issues elevated by the pandemic. It includes, for example, a dramatic buildup of the health care workforce, production of personal protective equipment (such as masks), more digital infrastructure (to allow better surveillance and working from home), widespread cleaning and sanitation services, and support for elder care.

“Freezing in place idle workers, empty spaces, and unused equipment at a time of such acute need would be costlier not just in narrow economic terms, but also in our ability to support and perform the most critical lifesaving functions,” economists Glen Weyl and Rajiv Sethi wrote.

Romer’s plan, meanwhile, focuses entirely on testing — tens of millions of tests every day. He envisions the US running more than seven times the Covid-19 tests in a single day than it has during the entire duration of the coronavirus pandemic as of April 13.

Using an economic model he developed to gauge the effects of widespread testing, Romer argued a very high level of testing would make it possible to stop most if not all the current social distancing measures.

The idea: If the US tests just about everyone, and retests people every one or two weeks to make sure their conditions don’t change, the nation would be able to isolate a much smaller fraction of the population — just those confirmed to be infected — instead of taking blanket social distancing measures. Romer’s model accounts for false negatives and false positives, which he finds aren’t a real drawback if testing is aggressive enough.

The catch here, of course, is this requires dramatically scaling up testing — to roughly 150 times the current capacity. This is, to put it lightly, extremely ambitious; Romer compared it to building the US’s interstate highways, which took years. Testing at such a level would also take a massive investment in labs and supplies. Even if it’s possible down the line, it’ll take time — months, if not years — to scale up to that point, during which at least some level of social distancing measures will be necessary.

But if Romer’s modeling is to be believed and if such a level of testing proves possible — and those are very big ifs — it’s a way out of widespread social distancing even before a vaccine or other treatment is widely available. At the very least, it shows how valuable it would be to simply test many, many more people.

It’s unclear if any of these plans are politically feasible

There is good empirical evidence that doing what these plans are calling for would work. One of the big lessons from the 1918 flu pandemic, which was linked to up to 100 million deaths globally and about 675,000 deaths in the US, is that early, aggressive, and layered social distancing works — not just to save lives, but to help economies recover after a disease outbreak. In a modern context, South Korea managed to control its coronavirus outbreak with the kind of aggressive testing-and-tracing strategy that all these plans propose.

What’s less clear is if any of these plans are practical or sustainable.

These plans require at least weeks of extreme social distancing, followed by months of reduced but still significant social distancing and potentially new waves of lockdowns if coronavirus cases rise again. In total, people could be forced to do a year and a half — or more — of at least some social distancing. That’s … a lot.

Less than a month since states issued stay-at-home orders, there have already been cracks in the process. Trump backed down from his hopes of reopening the country by Easter, but he has reportedly continued to push opening the economy soon, even as his experts advise against it. In the middle of an election year, Trump seems particularly eager to get the economy back on track.

The general public and other leaders may come to side with Trump as social distancing drags on for months and months. “I don’t think people are prepared for that and I am not certain we can bear it,” Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, previously told Vox. “I have no idea what political leaders will decide to do. To me, even if this is needed, it seems unsustainable.” She added that while she may just be feeling pessimistic, “it’s really hard ... to imagine this country staying home for months.”

Further complicating matters is that the benefits of social distancing are largely invisible while they’re occurring — because there’s no clear indication when a coronavirus case or death is avoided. “It’s the paradox of public health: When you do it right, nothing happens,” Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University, previously told me.

It’s the kind of situation that requires clear leadership from the top. But the US is dealing with this in a fragmented federalist system, with states largely on their own when it comes to public health policy and particularly mandating social distancing. Trump could offer some guidance here, but between denying that coronavirus was a major threat early on and more recently calling for a return to normal, he hasn’t shown he can reliably do that. (To this end, both West Coast and East Coast states have been forced to put together their own regional plans in lieu of a federal strategy.)

All of this is likely to fuel greater demand to end social distancing, especially among risk-averse politicians eyeing their reelections. We know the risks: Cities saw resurgences in flu cases in 1918 when they pulled back social distancing measures, and several countries in Asia are seeing second waves as they’ve eased restrictions. But people can be very good at convincing themselves, especially when they’re already suffering, that maybe this time will be different.

Meanwhile, the only plan that offers a quicker solution is Romer’s, but it proposes a level of testing that’s hard to imagine. The US has taken months to get to 150,000 tests a day. To get to 20 million would require a massive investment in labs, machines, and testing supplies — which Romer himself compared to building the interstate highway system, one of the most expensive infrastructure projects in US history. It also requires retesting people every two weeks, which a lot of the population just might not be up for.

No federal policymaker has called for this level of testing — and some experts are skeptical it can happen. “I’ve talked to some people who want to do 5 million [tests] a day,” Jha, of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said. “I’m like, ‘Okay, let’s calm down.’ I would love to do 5 million a day too, but let’s learn if we can walk before we can run.”

That’s the unsatisfying conclusion from reading these plans: While the US can do things to make the situation better, things likely are not going to be okay or normal for months and months. How the country deals with those circumstances and all the uncertainty involved isn’t something any plan can predict.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Ella Nilsen', 'May']",2020-05-02,Trump’s purge of inspectors general continues. It’s an assault on good governance.,"President Donald Trump’s purge of officials who question his leadership continues — this time targeting another watchdog, one who accurately described America’s dearth of medical supplies and tests as the country works to confront the coronavirus crisis.

Late on Friday, the Trump administration announced it had nominated Jason Weida — an assistant US attorney in Boston — for an inspector general position at the Department of Health and Human Services, one of the agencies tasked with responding to the country’s outbreak.

The problem is that position is already filled by Christi Grimm, who before the nomination had not publicly expressed a desire to step down as the department’s principal deputy inspector general.

So why the sudden change? The answer is easy enough to divine: her report released last month laid bare Trump’s feckless coronavirus response.

Why Grimm’s coronavirus report made Trump so angry

In late March, Grimm surveyed over 300 hospitals in nearly 50 states and territories to better understand what they faced as an influx of coronavirus patients flooded their facilities. What she found was “their most significant challenges centered on testing and caring for patients with COVID-19 and keeping staff safe. Hospitals said that severe shortages of testing supplies and extended waits for test results limited hospitals’ ability to monitor the health of patients and staff.”

“They also reported that widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) put staff and patients at risk,” she also wrote. “In addition, hospitals said that they were not always able to maintain adequate staffing levels or to offer staff adequate support.”

While the report didn’t directly question the federal government’s response, it made clear hospitals still had serious concerns about their ability to care for patients many weeks after the first coronavirus case was detected in the US.

Trump was asked about this report during an April 6 press conference with the government’s coronavirus task force. He fumed at the conclusions.

“It’s just wrong. Did I hear the word ‘inspector general’? Really? It’s wrong. And they’ll talk to you about it. It’s wrong,” he asserted. And then he wanted to know exactly who wrote the report. “Where did he come from — the inspector general? What’s his name? ... No, what’s his name? What’s his name? ... If you find me his name, I’d appreciate it.”

When it became clear to him that Grimm served in the Obama administration, he derided the report as “a typical fake-news deal.” But, Grimm is a career official who’s been in government since the Clinton administration and has worked for two Democrats and two Republicans, including Trump. She took over her current role as acting inspector general after the last person in that position left.

None of that information seemed to sink in for Trump, as just one day later he assailed Grimm on Twitter.

Why didn’t the I.G., who spent 8 years with the Obama Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, V.P. & others in charge, before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2020

It’d be one thing if Trump’s ire was reserved only for Grimm and her eventual dismissal was a one-off thing — as disturbing as such a one-off would be. But this is clearly a pattern for the president, one that’s a troubling sign about the health of good governance in America.

Ethics experts call Trump’s recent staffing changes “a war on accountability”

In early April, Trump went on a firing rampage.

He pushed out Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, the oversight official responsible for forwarding the Ukraine whistleblower’s report to Congress and triggering Trump’s impeachment. Days later, after attacking Grimm, news broke that Trump removed another inspector general, Glenn Fine, from his job overseeing coronavirus relief spending — abruptly and without explanation.

Vox’s Zack Beauchamp last month described what all of this really meant:

Atkinson’s firing was not merely revenge for impeachment. It was a warning that, during the coronavirus crisis, Trump would not tolerate similarly vigorous oversight of his conduct. Official watchdogs are on notice: Doing your job too effectively could be career suicide. This is a war on the very concept of oversight — and a sign that the United States is not immune from a global trend of creeping coronavirus authoritarianism.

This was perhaps the logical end point after Trump pressured Ukraine into opening investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden’s family last year without an indictment from the Senate. The president has surely concluded he can now get away with anything, including punishing those who dare point out his presidency is anything other than a roaring success.

That, experts note, is scary. “This is a war on accountability,” tweeted Walter Shaub, the former White House ethics chief who stepped down over Trump’s actions, “and [it] won’t end until Trump destroys every last institutional safeguard against corruption.”

Based on Trump’s decision to replace Grimm, it’s a war the president seems to be winning.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Ella Nilsen', 'May']",2020-05-02,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s failed coronavirus response, in one video","Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has mishandled his country’s coronavirus outbreak so badly that it’s possible over 1 million people in Brazil have contracted the disease. Despite this crisis, he’s continued to downplay Covid-19’s severity and his own powers to do anything about it.

Bolsonaro has referred to the novel coronavirus as the “little flu” and scoffed at social distancing measures intended to slow the spread of the virus, proclaiming in late March that “we’ll all die one day.” He’s called on citizens to go back to work, directly contradicting the orders of state governors and the recommendations of his public health experts. His minimization of the problem has saddled the country of more than 200 million people, South America’s largest, with the continent’s worst outbreak.

It’s no surprise, then, that people inside and outside of Brazil have noticed his disastrous and dangerous performance. The Brazilian Report, an online news outlet focused on the country, released a video Friday afternoon starkly showing just how bad it really is.

Over 90 seconds, the video tracks the exponential growth of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths in the country. As the curve grows, some dates are punctuated with Bolsonaro’s quotes, highlighting his indifference to public health concerns.

“It’s overstated,” he said of the threat on March 9. “We can’t do more than we’re already doing,” he stated on March 23. “Everyone will die someday,” he proclaimed on March 29. And, as if in self-parody, he brushed off calls for him to act by quipping on April 28, “So what? I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?”

VIDEO: Bolsonaro's response to #Covid19 as deaths pile up pic.twitter.com/BoaBfWG9NC — The Brazilian Report (@BrazilianReport) May 1, 2020

The larger tragedy still: Bolsonaro is unlikely to change his approach to the crisis — in part because his attention is divided.

He’s embroiled in political scandals that threaten his presidency. The president’s son Flávio, a state senator, has been under investigation for some time for an alleged money-laundering scheme in which he is accused of using public funds to pay nonexistent employees, including at a chocolate shop in Rio de Janeiro. And popular Justice Minister Sérgio Moro resigned after Bolsonaro fired the chief of the federal police, Maurício Valeixo, without a clear reason.

During his exit speech, Moro accused Bolsonaro of trying to meddle in law enforcement, saying the president had fired Valeixo because he wanted “a person he could be in touch with personally, whom he could call directly, from whom he could receive information, intelligence reports.”

That roiling political fire will likely distract Bolsonaro for weeks, not that he’d taken the crisis seriously before then. Which means the people of Brazil may continue to suffer under their president’s poor leadership in the days to come — in which case any updates to the above video may have a steeper curve and more damning quotes.

"['Dylan Matthews', 'Mar']",2020-03-12,11 coronavirus pandemic charts everyone should see,"Editor’s note, April 1: Please note that details about the coronavirus pandemic are changing rapidly — visit our coronavirus hub to read all our up-to-date coverage. Click here for the CDC’s current public health guidance.

The outbreak of Covid-19, a coronavirus-caused illness that originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to most of the world, is one of the most serious public health crises in decades. It has spread far wider than Ebola did in 2014, and the World Health Organization has designated it a pandemic. Johns Hopkins’s tracker is worth bookmarking with case number counts in the US and worldwide as the crisis progresses.

The situation on the ground is evolving incredibly quickly, and it’s impossible to synthesize everything we know into clean, intelligible charts. But we do know a fair bit about how bad the outbreak is, what the disease does, and what controlling and ultimately ending the outbreak will look like.

With that in mind, here are nine charts that help explain the Covid-19 coronavirus crisis.

1) The virus is spreading rapidly

The confirmed Covid-19 caseload has risen rapidly day to day, but here’s where things stood as of March 15. This is almost certainly a substantial underestimate, as testing capacity varies widely from country to country and many if not most people infected with the virus have not been diagnosed yet.

Many of the reported cases are still from the earlier peak in China. But while the number of new cases in China has fallen, the number of new international cases is rising, indicating that the epicenter of the problem has shifted from China to new places like Europe and the United States.

Note that the huge spike in new cases was due to improved data reporting from China; there was not one particularly bad day in the middle of February.

2) Know the symptoms

The symptoms of Covid-19 vary from case to case, but the most common ones in China, from February data, are fever and dry cough (which are each seen in a majority of cases), fatigue, and sputum (the technical term for thick mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract).

3) This is much more severe than an ordinary flu

It is tempting to compare Covid-19 to a more familiar disease: the seasonal flu. After all, the flu also has mild symptoms for most people, and can be dangerous and lethal among vulnerable populations like the elderly. President Trump even made this comparison recently.

But as the case fatality data shows, there’s no real comparison. About 6 percent of people 60 or older infected with Covid-19 die, according to the data from China we have so far; that’s over six times the fatality rate in the US for older people infected with the flu. The overall Covid-19 fatality rate may be 12 to 24 times the flu death rate. (Estimates for the fatality rate for Covid-19 vary, and they vary by region depending on response to the outbreak.)

4) Experts also think Covid-19 is more contagious than the ordinary flu

There’s another way that Covid-19 is a tougher adversary than the seasonal flu: Its R0 (“R nought”) is over 2, indicating that it’s more contagious than the typical flu. R0 estimates the number of people an average infected person spreads the disease to. “R0 is important because if it’s greater than 1, the infection will probably keep spreading, and if it’s less than 1, the outbreak will likely peter out,” the Atlantic’s Ed Yong explains. Covid-19’s R0 is substantially higher than 1, giving more reason for concern.

5) Older people in China have been at the greatest risk of dying from Covid-19

The Spanish flu of 1918-’19, the most horrific pandemic in modern times, focused mainly on the young. It had biological similarities to a flu pandemic in the 1830s that gave some older people in the 1910s limited immunity.

Covid-19 is not like that. So far, deaths in China have been concentrated among older adults, who have weaker immune systems on average than younger people and have a higher rate of chronic illness. People of all ages with chronic medical conditions are also at higher risk. The risk of death is real for younger people as well, but older people are most at risk.

6) Death rates in China have declined over time

One glimmer of hope in this story is that Chinese medical authorities appeared to get better at treating infections and preventing death as the outbreak proceeded. “Even the first and hardest-hit province, Hubei, saw its death rate tumble as public health measures were strengthened and clinicians got better at identifying and treating people with the disease,” Vox’s Julia Belluz explains.

The rate didn’t go down on its own; China took drastic, even authoritarian measures to lock down affected areas and contain the virus’s spread so that the medical system was not overwhelmed.

7) But the US pandemic is looking like Italy’s so far

This chart, adapted by my colleagues Dylan Scott and Rani Molla from work by John Burn-Murdoch of the Financial Times, compares how the confirmed caseload in each country has evolved since the 100th case. Note that the scale is logarithmic: 10,000 is as far from 20,000 as it is from 5,000. Straight lines actually show exponential growth.

Singapore and Hong Kong seem to have managed slow exponential growth, as has Japan to a degree. But the US seems to be following the trajectory of Italy, whose outbreaks have forced the country to adopt a dramatic quarantine policy, and Iran, which has declined a quarantine and is only seeing worsening outcomes. The good news is that South Korea was on this trajectory too but appears to have slowed the disease’s spread; time will tell if South Korea is able to maintain those results, or if it faces another wave of the virus.

8) The US is not testing enough people

The Trump administration’s slow rollout of testing for coronavirus has become something of a national scandal, and it’s easy to see why when you compare the US testing rate to that of other affected countries. South Korea stands out for its rapid rollout of extensive testing, including through innovative drive-through testing programs.

Drive-through testing is being piloted in some parts of the US, like New Hampshire, but we still have a long way to go before we match South Korean and Chinese testing levels. For the most up-to-date data on this issue, check here.

9) Why canceling events and self-quarantining is so important

Covid-19 has quickly made large-scale gatherings and conferences unpopular if not socially frowned upon. This change arrived quickly, and may seem jarring, but it’s easier to see the logic when you understand the theory behind this kind of “social distancing” policy. The key is to “flatten the curve”: slowing the rate of increase in infections so that you spread out the cases, even if the total number doesn’t change.

Flattening the curve slows the rate at which new cases arrive in hospitals, easing the burden on health care infrastructure and improving the odds that individual patients will survive.

Read more from Eliza Barclay and Dylan Scott here.

10) Social distancing really works to flatten the curve

This chart, building on a model by entrepreneur Tomas Pueyo, is a potent illustration of how social distancing — avoiding bars/restaurants and big gatherings, staying inside and working from home if at all possible, etc. — right now can help “flatten the curve” and slow the virus’s growth. The chart compares how a single day’s delay in social distancing can increase the peak of the outbreak significantly, by 40 percent using the parameters Pueyo opted for. Note that this is merely a theoretical projection, but we need to rely on theory to generate predictions during fast-moving crises like this. For more, see Umair Irfan’s piece here.

11) Just because you don’t feel sick doesn’t mean you’re safe to move around

Social distancing isn’t just about protecting yourself. It’s primarily about protecting other people by slowing transmission. To see how this works, consider the above chart showing the March 10 estimate by a group of scientists, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, of the incubation period of the virus.

As Vox’s Brian Resnick explains, “you can see that nearly everyone who develops symptoms of Covid-19 shows them around 10 to 15 days after the infection, and the majority get symptoms by around five days.” That means that many patients are asymptomatic for days after being infected. That means that “not feeling sick” isn’t a good enough reason to break social distancing norms. You could just be incubating the virus and spreading it inadvertently.

"['Brian Resnick', 'Mar']",2020-03-27,"Ventilator vs. respirator, quarantine vs. isolation: Covid-19 pandemic terms, defined","With the Covid-19 pandemic, there are so many new things we need to grow accustomed to. We’re physically avoiding many of the people and places we love, and too many are now being burdened by the sudden economic crisis that has arisen alongside the pandemic.

But there are also a lot of new, and confusing, terms we’re hearing about.

It’s okay if you’re unsure of the difference between a respirator and a ventilator, or the distinction between isolation and quarantine. We hope this glossary of pandemic terms will help.

We’ll update this as new confusing terms start popping up in the news.

Virus and outbreak terms

SARS-CoV-2 — The formal, scientific name of the virus that’s causing this pandemic. (It’s short for “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.”)

Covid-19 — The disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. If you’re sick, you have Covid-19. You were infected by SARS-CoV-2. (If you’re still confused, think about how the HIV virus causes AIDS.)

Coronavirus — This is a family of viruses that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to (technically they are known as betacoronaviruses, but you can just say coronavirus). The 2003 SARS outbreak was a coronavirus, as was MERS in 2012. They are named coronaviruses because of their shape. When viewed through a microscope, the individual virus looks like a sphere surrounded by a spiky crown (or corona).

Endemic — A disease that regularly infects humans, like the flu, strep throat, or any common illness. There are four coronavirus strains that commonly infect humans, usually manifesting as colds. It’s possible that SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, too.

Pandemic — A worldwide spread of a new disease. Most famous, perhaps, is the 1918 flu pandemic that is believed to have infected one in three people on the planet. Pandemic diseases can become endemic. The World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Epidemic — A disease that’s spreading over a wide area. An epidemic is a less severe designation than a pandemic, but there is an overlap between the two terms. And yes, it’s a bit confusing: “While a pandemic may be characterized as a type of epidemic, you would not say that an epidemic is a type of pandemic,” Merriam-Webster explains. The 2015-2016 spread of the Zika virus through South and Central America and the Caribbean was an epidemic.

Herd immunity — Herd immunity occurs when enough people become immune to a disease — either through exposure or via a vaccine — that the spread of the disease begins to slow, or stop, within a population. Right now, immunity to Covid-19 is not well understood. In time, researchers will be able to test the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19 in the weeks and months following their infection and see if they still are immune. And those studies will teach us about whether we, collectively, can develop herd immunity to Covid-19.

Zoonotic disease — A illness that can pass between animals and humans. Covid-19 is a zoonotic disease. It’s believed SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats. HIV, Ebola, Zika virus, and even measles (which jumped from cows to humans a very long time ago) are all believed to have originated in animals, in some form, before spreading to humans.

R0 — Pronounced r-nought, R0 is the statistic that describes how contagious a disease is. “The figure refers to how many other people one sick person is likely to infect on average in a group that’s susceptible to the disease (meaning they don’t already have immunity from a vaccine or from fighting off the disease before),” Vox’s Julia Belluz explains. An R0 of 2, for example, means each infected person is expected to spread the virus to two others. The exact R0 for Covid-19 is still being determined, but it’s currently believed to be between 2 and 2.5.

Confirmed cases — The number of Covid-19 cases that have been confirmed by diagnostic testing. Due to a shortage of tests, the actual number of cases that exist is likely much higher.

Case fatality rate (CFR) — The death rate. This figure explains what percentage of Covid-19 cases are fatal. It varies by country and age group, and the final figure will depend on figuring out the true number of cases (which is hard to estimate without widespread testing).

Modes of transmission — How a virus spreads from one person to another. Scientists are still working out how exactly this virus spreads. The main mode of transmission appears to be via droplets. These are bits of virus-laden fluid a person spews out when they cough or sneeze. Researchers are still working out the conditions under which the virus can be airborne, meaning how long viral particles can linger in the air under some environmental conditions. It’s also possible that the virus can spread via the fecal-oral route, meaning the virus can be transmitted through feces, which can then contaminate water or food if good hygiene is lacking.

Public health measures

Social distancing — A slew of tactics meant to keep people from congregating, with the goal of keeping people 6 feet apart from one another. Six feet of distance helps keep droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth from hitting another person. These tactics include canceling schools, public events, closing down restaurants, and banning events of 10 or more people.

Quarantine — Restricting the movement of, or isolating, people who might have been exposed to an infection but who aren’t yet sick. Usually, quarantine restricts a person’s movement to their home.

Isolation — Separating people with confirmed or probable infections from other healthy people, so that they can get better without infecting anyone else. One member of a household could be in isolation (perhaps in a designated room that others do not enter), while the other members of the household are in quarantine (free to move around the home but not enter the isolation area).

Lockdown — “The term ‘lock-down’ isn’t a technical term used by public health officials or lawyers,” Lindsay Wiley, a health law professor at the Washington College of Law, explained in an email. “It could be used to refer to anything from mandatory geographic quarantine (which would probably be unconstitutional under most scenarios in the US), to non-mandatory recommendations to shelter in place (which are totally legal and can be issued by health officials at the federal, state, or local level), to anything in between (e.g. ordering certain events or types of businesses to close, which is generally constitutional if deemed necessary to stop the spread of disease based on available evidence).”

Cordon sanitaire — The restriction of movement in and out of a region or city. China imposed one on the city of Wuhan during the early days of the outbreak.

Shelter in place — An order requesting people stay at home, except for trips to the grocery store, pharmacies, and other essential errands. Each state or city might define “shelter in place” slightly differently. (Like “lockdown,” this term can refer to a variety of guidelines.) Each local government could also enforce these orders differently — from just asking citizens to do it on a volunteer basis to enforcing orders with police citations. The important thing is to check with your local authority for details on what is allowed, and what is not, when the local government tells you to shelter in place. Some cities, like Washington, DC, are not using this term but are instead telling people to “stay home.” It’s effectively the same thing.

Medical equipment and pharmaceuticals

Ventilator — A machine that moves air in and out of the lungs in the case that a patient cannot, or is having trouble breathing on their own.

PPE — Personal protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, face shields, and other gear that keeps health care workers from catching an infection.

Respirator — A face mask that seals around the mouth and filters out particles from the air before they are breathed in. An N95 respirator, for example, filters out “95 percent of very small (0.3 micron) test particles,” the Food and Drug Administration explains. Doctors, nurses, and hospital workers are facing shortages of this essential protective facewear.

Surgical mask or face mask — These are loose-fitting masks that don’t filter out as many particles as a respirator. But they do stop a wearer from spreading droplets of contagion when they sneeze or cough. They’re also helpful in preventing a wearer from touching their face with dirty hands.

Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine — Antimalarial drugs hyped by President Trump (despite weak evidence) as being potentially useful in treating Covid-19. Clinical trials of these drugs are underway, but early evidence is still not clear they prove useful. These aren’t the only drugs currently being tested to treat Covid-19: Doctors are also testing antiviral medication and some HIV drugs. These drugs are also used to treat arthritis and lupus, as they also have anti-inflammatory properties.

Fever — Generally, a fever is when the body temperature exceeds 100.4°F, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But there is some variability here. Human bodies tend to be coldest when we wake up. So a 100.4-degree fever in the morning might grow a little hotter throughout the day. Some people also run a little hotter or colder than others. The CDC advises “fever may be considered to be present if a person has not had a temperature measurement but feels warm to the touch, or gives a history of feeling feverish.”

Pneumonia — When the small air sacs of the lungs (alveoli, the structures where gases from the atmosphere are exchanged with the blood) become inflamed and fill up with fluid. It’s a possible symptom of Covid-19.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) — A technology used for Covid-19 diagnostic testing. It looks for the virus’s genetic signature.

Serological tests — A diagnostic test that looks for antibodies (a blood protein built to help fight off a specific virus or pathogen), could tell if someone has ever been infected with Covid-19, and could suggest they are possibly immune. These tests are still being developed for Covid-19.

Vaccine — A formulation to stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies for a pathogen in the hope of providing immunity to that pathogen. Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being tested, but it could be a year or more before they are approved. A safe and effective vaccine can stop this pandemic in its tracks.

Therapeutics — Drugs that lessen the severity of disease symptoms. The World Health Organization is currently facilitating a multinational clinical trial, testing medicines — and combinations of medicines — to treat Covid-19. Therapeutics won’t necessarily stop the outbreak, though. They may keep people from getting severely sick or dying. Even with therapeutics, the virus could still spread, infecting millions.",vox,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/27/21190774/ventilator-respirator-quarantine-isolation-definitions-covid-19-pandemic-terms

"['Zeeshan Aleem', 'Alex Ward', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Ella Nilsen', 'May']",2020-05-02,3 California counties are defying state orders on reopening businesses,"Three counties in California have announced they’re reopening segments of their economy in defiance of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s statewide restrictions on nonessential business, which were put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus.

The announcements, which came as anti-lockdown protests sprang up across the state this week, raise questions of how much Newsom can expect voluntary compliance with social distancing restrictions as unemployment skyrockets, cabin fever sets in for people stuck at home, and quarantine measures become increasingly politicized.

Modoc County was the first county to make the move. On Thursday it announced it would reopen many kinds of venues on Friday, including restaurants, bars, and churches. Modoc County is a small, rural, and conservative district on California’s border with Oregon — it has 9,600 residents and no confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of May 2.

There, some county officials framed their decision to disregard the statewide order as nothing more than the early adoption of future reopening plans — and they argued the fact they’ve seen no confirmed cases means the safeguards required in a place like Los Angeles aren’t needed in Modoc County.

“We’re not in this at all to defy anything. We align with the plans. We’re just at a different phase in this because of where we are and how we live,” Heather Hadwick, deputy director of Modoc County’s Office of Emergency Services, told Politico.

The county’s plan does call for some limited restrictions — for example, restaurants and bars are expected to cut maximum capacity by half, and officials recommend that people who are over the age of 65 or have underlying health conditions remain at home.

Since March 19, California has been under shelter-in-place orders which call for residents to stay at home. That order says only essential services such as grocery stores and pharmacies can remain open. (Restaurants can offer take-out and delivery.) On the state’s website, there is a section explaining how local orders should be seen in relation to the statewide order; the site simply notes, “This is a statewide order” — which suggests the directive is meant to override local orders.

Despite this, on Friday, two other counties — Sutter and Yuba — announced that they too will be reopening venues as of Monday.

“The purpose is to continue to mitigate the spread of the virus to the greatest extent possible while addressing the need to gradually reopen the economy in order to ensure vital services are resumed in a safe manner,” Phuong Luu, who serves as the health officer for the two adjacent counties, said in the news release.

Luu described the reopening as intending to comply with the state order, even though it blatantly diverges from it. The counties will allow restaurants, shopping malls, gyms, hair salons, tattoo parlors, and many other venues to reopen.

Unlike Modoc County, these counties have substantial populations (around 170,000 combined) and dozens of confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of May 2.

As Politico reports, state lawmakers in the region have praised the move. Assemblyman James Gallagher said “there is no longer any justification for [Newsom’s] executive order as it pertains to our communities,” and that he’s “optimistic that other counties will soon follow soon.”

It’s unclear what measures Newsom could or would take to enforce state orders. But what’s plain is that he’s coming under increasing pressure to relax his stay-at-home measures. And some people — particularly conservatives who are more skeptical of policies to curb the spread of coronavirus — are inclined to go rogue.

Protests are spreading in California

Some of that pressure is coming from areas of the state that have seen far greater confirmed Covid-19 case counts.

As in many other states across the US, small demonstrations protesting lockdown measures have surfaced across California in recent weeks. On Friday, those protests appeared to escalate, with demonstrations in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, and Orange County’s Huntington Beach. City police estimated that nearly 3,000 people showed up at the Huntington Beach protest alone.

Many demonstrators framed Newsom’s orders as unacceptable government overreach, and formed tight crowds that violated social distancing guidelines.

“I served in the army and fought tyrants and dictators overseas and this has gone too far,” a protester at Huntington Beach told the Los Angeles Times. “I didn’t do that to come back here and live under a tyrant in my own country.”

Thousands of people — many not wearing face masks — showed up at the state capitol in Sacramento to call for, among other things, an end to restrictions on business. Some of them held signs questioning whether coronavirus is real, and arguing against vaccines.

At a Friday news briefing, Newsom attempted to walk the line of acknowledging rising tension and anxiety without coming across as yielding to political pressure.

“We’re all impatient and we’re deeply anxious and deeply desirous to start to turn the page and turn the corner,” he said. “The data is starting to give us more confidence.”

He also suggested that the schedule for reopening he’s discussed earlier might be accelerating.

“We’re getting very close to making very meaningful augmentations to that stay-at-home order,” he said. “We said ‘weeks, not months’ about four or five days ago. I want to say ‘many days, not weeks.’ As long as we continue to be prudent and thoughtful in certain modifications, I think we’ll be making some announcements.”

"['Sam Ellis Mac Schneider Joe Posner Estelle Caswell Melissa Hirsch Adam Freelander', 'Sam Ellis', 'Mac Schneider', 'Joe Posner', 'Estelle Caswell', 'Melissa Hirsch', 'Adam Freelander', 'Mar']",2020-03-16,Why fighting the coronavirus depends on you,"In March 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as a pandemic. That means the disease no longer constitutes just an outbreak or even an epidemic; the coronavirus has now spread around the world, and will continue to reach into other countries and communities.

That’s in part because of how contagious the virus is. When you’re infected with the flu, it takes about two days before you start to show symptoms. But coronavirus symptoms take an average of five to six days to appear, so it’s easy to spread well before you notice that you’re feeling sick. Many people are spreading it while going about their daily lives as usual.

The risk is that once coronavirus starts to spread in a community, about 20 percent of cases are severe and may require hospitalization. As those cases multiply, hospitals can fill up quickly. And people with severe cases of Covid-19 who can’t receive proper medical attention are at a much higher risk of dying.

Ideally, we would be able to stop the virus from spreading entirely. We can’t do that right now. What we can do is slow it down, so that the severe cases get spread out over a longer period of time, and hospitals are less likely to be overwhelmed on any given day. And that’s where each one of us comes in. The best way to slow down the spread is for everyone — healthy, sick, young, old — to limit social contact as much as possible, immediately. This is called social distancing, and it only works if enough of us do it. But if we do, it could mean the difference between the life and death of someone you know.

Watch the video above to see how social distancing can work.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Ella Nilsen', 'May']",2020-05-02,Can children spread the coronavirus? It’s complicated.,"As most of the world continues to socially distance because of the coronavirus, Switzerland’s infectious disease chief wants to loosen restrictions for children — so they can hug their grandparents.

It’s a poignant move, as it was made in part to benefit older people’s mental health. But it’s also very risky, as it’s unclear whether or not young children, who generally seem to get mild cases of Covid-19, transmit the disease to others at similar rates as adults.

As that scientific debate rages, Daniel Koch, the Swiss infectious disease chief, firmly planted his flag on one side of it Wednesday. “Young children are not infected and do not transmit the virus,” he told reporters, referring to a study released this month as well as his conversations with Swiss health experts.

The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, where Koch works, says children under 10 years old rarely get the virus. “When they get sick, they often have only light symptoms,” spokesperson Yann Hulmann told me in an email. “They are apparently not big spreaders and are often infected by adults. So reopening schools does not seem to be a major problem.”

The risk of such a hug “is very low compared to the benefit for the mental health of the grandparents,” Hulmann added.

The views of Swiss officials didn’t come out of nowhere. They come amid a growing number of released reports from public health and infectious disease experts suggesting children spread the virus far less than adults. They form part of the justification for why Denmark reopened its schools earlier this month and why Spain this week allowed children 13 years old or younger to play outside.

But the science is far from settled. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says kids “can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions.” And other studies show children continue to display similar transmission abilities as adults, leading experts to caution against trusting kids not to spread the disease.

“What we don’t know yet is the degree to which children can transmit the virus,” Dr. Danielle Zerr, an infectious disease expert at Seattle Children’s Hospital, told me.

This isn’t some trivial debate. World leaders face hard choices over which parts of society to reopen, when, and how quickly. Plus, staying home from school could curb children’s educational progress, while disrupting the work-life balance for adults. If children can head back to school with minimal health risks, then that could prove a major benefit for the child, their parents, and society at large.

But at the moment, the only thing that’s clear is that there’s no real clarity on this issue. Still, it’s worth looking into the science for each case, and what the data does and doesn’t say about coronavirus transmissibility from young children.

The evidence for why kids rarely transmit the coronavirus

It’s not entirely clear why, but so far, children don’t seem to be getting Covid-19 as often as adults. As Business Insider pointed out on Thursday:

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1.7% of 150,000 American COVID-19 cases affected people under the age of 18. Globally the amount of children with COVID-19 is under 2% of all cases, from Korea to Spain to Italy.

And there is a growing body of scientific literature showing young children may not be as likely to spread the virus to others as older people.

Take this April 22 study from the government of New South Wales, the Australian state that contains one-third of the country’s population and the city of Sydney. Researchers looked at five primary schools, with kindergarten through seventh grade (in US terms), from March to mid-April of this year. Schools prove a valuable testing case, not only because there are many children to observe, but also because they allow experts to gauge when the right time to restart normal schooling might be.

As the chart below shows, they found that only one person out of 168 in close contact with an infected person got sick with the virus.

Which led to the following conclusion: Covid-19 “transmission in children in schools appears considerably less than seen for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza.”

Top Australian officials, including Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, are now citing this report to say social distancing measures don’t need to be followed in schools as the country considers reopening them fully in the near future.

But Dr. Kristine Macartney, the study’s lead author, pushed back on such conclusions. “We did see low transmission, we didn’t see no transmission,” she told me. “I think children can still transmit coronavirus. That’s certainly the case. We’ve seen that.”

Macartney also noted the study is still a preliminary finding — it will go through the peer review process soon — and that more research is required. Her team “didn’t actually evaluate” whether the observed schools followed social distancing guidelines or not, and class attendance dropped considerably in April, meaning new cases of community spread among her study’s population could have emerged after its conclusion. “I don’t think our findings should be used as a single piece of evidence in anybody’s policy,” she said.

What she does emphasize is: “It’s not that transmission can’t happen, it’s just that evidence is suggesting ... that [transmission among children] happens at a lower rate than does transmission between adults.”

Other evidence for that claim includes a March non-peer-reviewed study from experts in China and Australia. Between December 2019 and March 2020, researchers looked at 31 households with coronavirus infections in China, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Iran.

What they found was someone 18 years or younger brought the disease into the home in just under 10 percent of cases. That’s remarkable, since previous studies had shown children were responsible for infecting their families with H5N1 bird flu in about 50 percent of cases.

The preliminary evidence for the claim that children don’t transmit the coronavirus at high rates also led the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) to be optimistic about kids and transmission on their website: “Data from population-based and cross-sectional studies indicate that children are unlikely to be primary source cases.”

However, when I followed up with the ECDC, spokesperson Alexandru Niculae told me in an email these and other studies “cannot be considered as ‘enough evidence’, this is still considered limited data; so we need to take this with a pinch of salt for the time being.”

Remain skeptical of low child transmission claims, at least for now

Despite all those studies, multiple experts told me it’s still completely possible that kids could be significant spreaders of the disease. Seattle Children’s Zerr is one of them. “If we document high levels of virus in their nose, I don’t know why they would be less likely to transmit,” she told me.

In other words, a child doesn’t necessarily have to be very ill to spread the virus. As long as a kid is near others with a load of virus in the nose or mouth — symptomatic or not — they could be a carrier and a transmitter.

A study released by Germany’s chief virologist Christian Drosten and others this week backs Zerr’s skepticism. Here’s what they found: “Analysis of variance of viral loads in patients of different age categories found no significant difference between any pair of age categories including children,” the researchers wrote. “In particular, these data indicate that viral loads in the very young do not differ significantly from those of adults.”

“Based on these results, we have to caution against an unlimited re-opening of schools and kindergartens in the present situation,” they concluded. “Children may be as infectious as adults.”

You can see a chart from the report below, which Drosten tweeted out Wednesday. What it makes clear, though, is the study looked at fewer cases of infected children than other age groups, which may have skewed the results. The paper also hasn’t yet been peer reviewed.

Viral loads by PCR as seen in our laboratories. No significant difference between children and adults.

All this means there’s no scientific consensus on the infectiousness of children — and that has many health officials urging caution.

The US CDC’s website, for example, says:

Because persons with asymptomatic and mild disease, including children, are likely playing a role in transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the community, social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors are recommended for persons of all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system from being overloaded, and protect older adults and persons of any age with serious underlying medical conditions.

And Beth Riggs, a spokesperson for the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, told me they continue to ask visitors — including young people — to follow “universal masking policies in place to help limit the potential spread of the virus and protect our patients, their families and our staff.”

Which makes the Swiss case — allowing health children to hug their grandparents — all the more troubling. It’s not that the country’s health officials say kids can roam free, but suggesting they effectively pose no risk is too absolute for experts like Zerr. “We have so much evidence of children with infections,” she told me after I read her the Swiss infection disease chief’s statement to the press. Koch’s statement, she told me, is “just not true.”

Covid-19 is a new disease, and as such, scientists have a lot more replicable research to do before the world can begin to even come close to understanding how children may spread it. And this uncertainty has many still taking necessary precautions until there’s more and confirmed evidence about whether children are actually rare spreaders of the disease.

In times like these, then, the cautious approach might be the best one.

As governments take drastic measures to enforce social distancing, restaurants are changing their menus and sanitizing habits, reducing capacities or closing entirely, or shifting to pickup and delivery (including “no-contact” options). The dining scenes in the biggest cities in America have been stopped in their tracks.

U.S. states — including Washington, Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio — have ordered all bars and restaurants to temporarily shut their doors for dine-in service.

"['Nathan Nichols', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Ella Nilsen', 'May']",2020-05-02,"I offered free rent because of the pandemic. Other landlords should do what they can, too.","I made my very first social media post on any platform on March 13, just as the first cases of the coronavirus hit the United States and uncertainty swept the nation. I wrote on Facebook that I wasn’t collecting rent for the month of April, asking other landlords to look at their own situations to see what, if any, relief they could offer, too. The post went viral and within a few days, the story was in the local and national media, a small offering of hope in an uncertain and frightening time.

It was only the night before that post that the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic hit me — not because of some government action or news story, but because of a chorus of Italian citizens all making the same plea: act now. As my sister and I scrolled through videos of Italian citizens calling for action, we started to worry about what a prolonged lockdown in our home city of Portland, Maine, would mean. She correctly predicted that the restaurant where she worked would close; she’d be out of work, with no way to recuperate her lost income. As a computer programmer, I would be able to work from home, but I quickly realized that my tenants wouldn’t be so lucky.

I own a two-unit apartment building in neighboring South Portland. Three roommates live in one unit; they are musicians and artists who work at venues in the city, and I figured they were having the same fears that my sister was. A young family with only one working parent lives in the second unit. They have had trouble paying rent on time in the past, and I knew they were probably freaking out.

I know what that stress is like. I grew up below the poverty line, with a single mother on food stamps, working two jobs. Even so, my family was never in any real danger; we owned our own home and we knew that if we got desperate, my grandparents could bail us out. A year ago, my mother gave me some of the inheritance she had gotten when they died, which I used to make a down payment on a rental property. I wanted to make a safe, long-term investment for my eventual retirement, and an income property seemed like the perfect choice. I put in enough to cover the down payment and other initial costs, and my tenants pay the mortgage, taxes, and upkeep. In 20 years, I can sell the building and get four to five times my initial investment.

Since I bought the building for the equity and not the income, giving up one month’s rent felt like a pretty simple thing to do. After I told them, I decided to post about it in hopes that some other landlords would be in a position to do the same. I never expected the thousands of shares and hundreds of comments that followed.

Many comments came from renters, worried that they wouldn’t be able to pay rent, but certain their landlords (mostly corporate) would be collecting as usual. Other comments came from landlords themselves, worried about their own finances if their tenants didn’t pay rent. Although not surprising, it was crushing to see so many Americans, in different economic situations, living month to month. The majority of the comments, however, came from ordinary people who were moved by my action. I was called a hero and a saint; I even got a marriage proposal. I was astonished, but even more so, I was saddened by these comments. If my action was truly as rare as these comments would indicate, then we are living in an epidemic of disempowerment.

Over the last decade, as I grew into financial security, I’d often think, “I worked hard for this. I earned this. I deserve this.” Maybe these thoughts were true, but really they were a way for me to avoid discomfort. By focusing on my right to “the good life,” I avoided any guilt or sense of responsibility.

Then, two years ago, my thinking changed. It happened after listening to season one of the DISSECT podcast, which closely examines an album by devoting each episode to a different song. This season detailed the rapper Kendrick Lamar’s internal struggle with fame and fortune as told on his album To Pimp a Butterfly. His story pushed me to see that I had power and responsibility I could no longer ignore.

Despite what some commentators have told me, this realization did not turn me into a saint. I still make decisions that primarily benefit myself and the people I love. But when possible, I try to make choices that benefit others. I’m lucky enough to have the option to do that. So many others simply don’t have options at all.

Across the nation, states are offering different forms of mortgage relief. If they qualify, landlords should be able to give their tenants some rent relief. In addition, many banks are offering interest-only mortgage payments, or waiving fees for missed payments. Most importantly, landlords should communicate with their lender, their state and local government, and their tenants to find solutions.

An early comment on my post was from a landlord who asked, “What are you going to do in May?” Last week I sent messages to my tenants so they would know what to expect this month. I told them that half their rent would cover my immediate expenses, two-thirds would also cover taxes and insurance, and anything else would go toward projects on the building. I said, pay what you can. The three friends paid 90 percent of their rent. The family not only paid their full rent, but insisted on paying an extra $50.

I don’t know what’s going to happen to our economy or my situation as this pandemic unfolds, and I don’t have the answers on how to fix so many of the deep issues of inequality that this crisis has only accentuated. What I do know is that when you add up all the choices ordinary people can make, you end up with a tremendous amount of power. I ask that you take a serious look at your situation and see what you can do.

"['Ella Nilsen', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-02,The White House has blocked Anthony Fauci from testifying in front of a House committee,"White House officials have blocked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s top infectious disease expert, from appearing at a House of Representatives hearing on America’s coronavirus response. It appears, however, that he will be allowed to appear at a later Senate hearing.

After the House Appropriations Committee sought Fauci’s testimony for a May 6 hearing on coronavirus and the government’s efforts to combat it, they were rebuffed by the White House, a committee spokesman told Vox.

“The Appropriations Committee sought Dr. Anthony Fauci as a witness at next week’s Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee hearing on COVID-19 response. We have been informed by an administration official that the White House has blocked Dr. Fauci from testifying,” committee spokesman Evan Hollander said in a statement.

In a statement to the Washington Post, the White House said it would be “counterproductive” to allow Fauci to testify in front of Congress in the midst of the government’s efforts to fight coronavirus.

“While the Trump Administration continues its whole-of-government response to COVID-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at Congressional hearings,” White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said in the statement. “We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time.”

As of now, Fauci is still slated to appear in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on May 12. Rather than hearing from a current White House official, the House Appropriations Committee will instead hear from Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Obama administration.

“Congress and the American public deserve a clear-eyed view of the path forward for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said House Appropriations Committee Chair Nita Lowey (D-NY) and Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) in a statement. “The people of this country deserve a federal government that is up-to-date, modernized, and prepared to protect lives.”

There has been past tension between Fauci and Trump

Fauci is the White House’s top infectious disease expert. But he’s become known for his straightforward, no-nonsense approach to discussing coronavirus — even if that means contradicting statements made by President Donald Trump or saying the administration could have acted sooner. These admissions, of course, fly in the face of statements by the Trump administration, which argue it acted swiftly and decisively to limit the effects of Covid-19.

It isn’t clear whether these comments were a factor in the White House decision not to allow Fauci to testify. Given the topic of the hearing, however, it seems inevitable questions about the Trump administration’s failings in addressing coronavirus would be posed. It also remains to be seen whether Fauci will be deemed too busy to appear before the Republican-controlled Senate committee later in May.

Fauci’s time has been in high demand. Public polling shows his approval rating with the American public is much higher than Trump’s, and he has become a sought-after official, both for interviews with the media and congressional testimony.

Fauci’s standing with Trump himself, however, is harder to ascertain. Trump once retweeted a call to fire Fauci that came from a conservative former California congressional nominee, without directly echoing the sentiment himself.

Sorry Fake News, it’s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up. Thank you @OANN https://t.co/d40JQkUZg5 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2020

As Vox’s Sean Collins wrote, it’s hard to know how serious Trump is about firing his incredibly popular top public health official in the middle of a pandemic.

In this context, what Trump’s retweet means — if anything — is unclear. On one hand, he has a history of communicating displeasure with members of his administration on Twitter before firing them, once tweeting, for example about his dissatisfaction with former Inspector General Michael Atkinson four months before suddenly firing him. On the other hand, Trump has been effusive with his praise of Fauci, calling him “extraordinary” and a “good man.” Given the president’s unpredictability, any number of explanations for the tweet are possible, from Trump blowing off steam at a moment of frustration over the CNN interview to him retweeting before having read the whole of Lorraine’s post.

It is possible the White House will reverse its decision on the House testimony — Fauci and other top public health experts were reportedly banned from doing interviews on CNN for a time, a decision said to be quickly discarded. And as Congress ramps up its oversight of the Trump administration’s continued response to coronavirus, they may seek more details about why Fauci was not allowed to testify in front of members.

"['Rory Taylor', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Native tribes still haven’t received the stimulus relief money they were promised,"More than a month after the CARES Act was passed, the Treasury Department has yet to disburse $8 billion in coronavirus relief funds to Native tribes. And now tribes are suing the department over the delay.

On Thursday, tribes filed a lawsuit saying the Treasury Department missed its April 26 deadline to distribute funds, which was 30 days after the CARES Act passed. It’s one of two lawsuits tribes have filed over the administration’s handling of the stimulus money in recent weeks.

The other was over the Treasury’s plans to distribute the money to for-profit Native corporations that tribes say have no business being earmarked for the relief funds in the first place.

On Monday, a federal judge ruled in favor of the more than a dozen Indian nations that contested the Treasury’s move to give Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) money set aside for tribes in the $2.2 trillion CARES Act. The injunction ruled that ANCs did not meet the definition of a “tribal government” set out in the act.

But on Friday, even in the face of the tribes’ new lawsuit, the Treasury Department sent a status report to the court, saying it “has not yet arrived at a determination” as to how to distribute the funds, according to the New York Times. The Treasury Department has not responded to Vox’s request for comment about a timeline for disbursement or the court cases.

The funds are critical for many tribes struggling to combat the Covid-19 crisis. According to a new study from Indigenous researchers at UCLA and the University of Arizona, the rate of new Covid-19 cases per 1,000 people is four times higher on Indian reservations than in other parts of the US. Meanwhile, Gallup, New Mexico — situated within the Navajo Nation — has reported one of the largest surges of cases in the past two weeks.

For many Indigenous communities, where access to health care and other infrastructure like clean running water is limited, Covid-19 presents significant challenges. This is compounded by high rates of chronic illness among Native people that could lead to complications from the coronavirus.

Congress has also been putting pressure on the Treasury Department to act. On Wednesday, House Democrats wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin demanding the department distribute the funds, saying “the detrimental impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have had a disproportionate health care and economic impact on federally recognized tribes due to a chronic lack of essential resources.” Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also told Mnuchin in a press conference Thursday to release the money “now.”

Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), vice chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, has been demanding accountability for weeks. “It’s now been more than a month since Congress passed the CARES Act, and Tribes still haven’t seen a dime of the relief funding Congress directed Treasury to provide for Tribal governments,” he told Vox in a statement on Friday. “While Tribes have been working around the clock to provide emergency services and economic stability for their communities on the front-lines of the COVID-19 crisis, the Treasury Department is unnecessarily dragging its feet following the Court ruling earlier this week that cleared the Department to get this money out to Indian Country.”

In the meantime, tribes have been left scrambling to keep their governments running and protect their citizens. “We are 100 percent relying on these dollars,” said Aaron Payment, chairperson of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, on an Indianz.com broadcast earlier this month.

Why tribes went to court over stimulus money

While the funding crisis is urgent for many tribes in Indian Country, the question being considered in the ANC court case was whether these corporations are considered tribal governments — a question that became a concern after the Trump administration said these corporations could access the $8 billion in stimulus money designated for the 574 federally recognized tribes. And because of Alaska’s complicated history, the answer is not entirely clear-cut.

ANCs were created after the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971, which solidified control of 44 million acres for Alaska Native communities but also extinguished all other land claims tribes had in the state. While there were several reasons for its passage, one was abundantly clear: ANCSA paved the way for oil and gas exploration, which some ANCs have gone on to profit from in the years since.

“Oil and gas industry really drove ANCSA in the first place. [The federal government and industry officials] are the ones who said, ‘To put the [Trans-Alaska] Pipeline in, we need to go through Indian land; we want an Act of Congress to give us authority to do that,’” Matthew Fletcher, a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, a Potawatomi descendant, and director of the Indigenous Law and Policy Center at Michigan State University College of Law, told Vox.

When ANSCA was passed, both ANCs and Alaska Native communities did not have a government-to-government relationship like federally recognized Indian nations do. Only in 1994, 23 years after ANCSA was signed, were Alaska Native communities officially recognized under the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act. Today, there are 229 Indian nations in Alaska, which is over half of all federally recognized Indian tribes in the country. There are more than 200 ANCs.

This history creates a unique, bifurcated system of tribal governance in Alaska. While the 229 Alaska Native tribal governments maintain sovereign status, ANCs still own all the Native land in the state. Many Alaska Native communities have a federally recognized tribal government and either have a Native village corporation or belong to a regional corporation, both of which are ANCs. This means that if stimulus money went to both ANCs and Native tribes in Alaska, some communities would get money twice — which tribes both inside and outside Alaska say is unfair.

According to court documents, in a hypothetical scenario in which all tribes, including ANCs, received equal amounts of funding, each tribe would get $4 million less. For many tribes still grappling with federal neglect and broken promises, that $4 million could make the difference between keeping a town running and not.

ANCs argued in court that they provide services to the tribes, and that because of the bifurcated governance system in Alaska, leaving out ANCs would harm Alaska Native communities and peoples.

“Where a lot of complexity in this case comes from is that some of those corporations are nonprofit corporations that do governmental work,” said Fletcher. In other words, while they were not set up as governments, ANCs sometimes offer services like job training and scholarships and don’t always profit off tribes.

On Monday, the federal court sided with the tribes and ruled that ANCs did not count as tribal governments. While normally, discrepancies between Alaska Native tribal governments and Alaska Native corporations would be settled at the state level, considering ANCs are incorporated under Alaska state law, the Trump administration’s decision to include ANCs as tribal governments has turned what would normally be a state issue into a national one. It cannot be overstated how unique this situation is. “I don’t know of any other cases like this,” said Fletcher.

Regardless of the confusion in this case, one thing is clear: None of this needed to happen. By originally making the decision to consider ANCs part of tribal governing structures, the Trump administration created a crisis on top of a crisis, at the expense of Indigenous peoples both in and outside Alaska who are in desperate need of funds that have not yet arrived.

Unfortunately, that’s an all-too-common story in Indian Country.

The state of Covid-19 in Indian Country

This is not the first time the Trump administration has taken actions that have harmed Indian tribes during the coronavirus pandemic — in March, it revoked the reservation status of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribes in Massachusetts. But what’s clear from looking at the history of Alaska Native communities, and tribes throughout Indian Country, is that the problems being faced today have much longer histories than the current administration.

On one hand, the $8 billion in stimulus is significant for tribal governments. Even after adjusting for inflation, it is one of the biggest funding infusions to Indian Country ever, including ANCSA. Yet that $8 billion is still a drop in the bucket compared to coronavirus relief funding for other state and local governments.

For many tribes, this funding cannot even begin to fix the systemic disinvestment Indigenous communities have had to endure. In a sworn declaration in one of the cases, Cheyenne River Sioux Chair Harold Frazier noted that the only on-reservation health care facility had “8 inpatient beds, 6 ventilators...and zero respiratory therapists” for the tribe’s 10,000 residents. According to court documents, Akiak Native Community Chief Mike Williams noted that without more funding, the tribe would be forced to shut down its food bank and turn off water and sewer services for some tribal members. On the Navajo Nation reservation, many houses lack access to running water and electricity, making public health recommendations around hand-washing hard to abide by.

With such high levels of inequity already across Indian Country, $8 billion is like sending a sprinkler to a wildfire.

This, perhaps, is what makes the current funding fight so egregious. Tribes have had to make the hard choice to compete against other Indigenous peoples to secure desperately needed funds that are still inadequate to protect their communities. And they have yet to receive this money.

“This is an urgent situation, and Native communities cannot afford to wait for the administration to get its act together,” Udall said. “Treasury needs to follow the law and the intent of Congress and get this money out the door and into the right hands as soon as possible.”

As Indian Country looks at the Covid-19 pandemic, memories are triggered of not only historical pandemics — like the 1918 flu epidemic — but of the historical negligence of the government obligated to protect them. In remembering his tribe’s removal to their current reservation, Frazier said, “the supplies came late, if ever, and were often spoiled and contaminated. The legacy of those limitations lives on ... despite our best efforts to improve the quality of life of our people.”

"['Brian Resnick', 'Mar']",2020-03-20,The 9 most important unanswered questions about Covid-19,"It’s easy to forget that just a few months ago, the virus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic around the world was not known, at all, to science.

In the months and weeks since, researchers have been learning as much as they can about this pathogen — and at breakneck speed. Scientists have sequenced its genome and begun to create vaccines in the hope of making people immune to it. They’ve also learned, critically, that people can pass the virus on to others before they get symptoms themselves. That makes the virus hard to contain. But it also makes it clear that severe actions — like the social distancing measures in place in the US and around the world — are necessary in the fight to save lives.

We still don’t know how this pandemic will play out. That’s in large part because there are crucial unanswered questions about this virus and the disease it causes. For example, researchers don’t yet have precise estimates of how deadly the virus is or an exact understanding of how it spreads. The answers to these questions will provide key insights into stopping this pandemic in the least disruptive way possible.

Related Scientists warn we may need to live with social distancing for a year or more

It may be too easy to look at these uncertainties and the lack of data and feel cavalier: Maybe this all isn’t as bad as people are saying.

Do not take comfort in these uncertainties. Take caution.

“The way we deal with the uncertainty is we have to cover all of our bases,” Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College. “A year from now we’ll realize some of the things that we did may not have been necessary.” But we have to proceed with extreme vigilance due to the many unknowns of this virus and the serious risk it poses to so many around the globe.

These are the nine most important unanswered questions about Covid-19 that will help determine the course of this outbreak. Be humbled by this list. We are. And take care.

1) How, exactly, does Covid-19 spread?

The virus — known as SARS-CoV-2 — that causes Covid-19 has infected more than 222,000 people since its emergence. (Of them, at least 9,000 have died.) That’s just the confirmed cases. A great many more may have occurred (more on that later).

Why has it spread so fast? “The best explanation for this rapid spread is that the virus is being passed through droplets from coughing or sneezing,” Vox’s Julia Belluz explains. “When these virus-laden droplets from an infected person reach the nose, eyes, or mouth of another, they can transmit the disease.”

But it’s still unknown how significant other modes of transmission are in spreading the disease.

It’s possible that the virus can spread through feces. (The CDC says, though, “the risk is expected to be low based on data from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses.” But if you weren’t already washing your hands vigorously after defecating, please do so now.). There are also uncertainties over how long the virus can linger in the air after a person coughs or sneezes.

You may have heard that the new coronavirus isn’t “airborne” — meaning that unlike extremely contagious diseases like measles, it’s unlikely to linger in the air for hours on end. But that doesn’t mean the virus can’t linger in the air for some amount of time.

As Wired explains, although some experts say the new coronavirus isn’t airborne, that’s based on a narrow scientific definition of the term. The virus can possibly still linger in the air for some time and under some conditions. As the journal Stat reports, we don’t yet know precisely what those conditions are. It will definitely be in the air in the moments after an infected person sneezes or coughs, but it’s unclear when the particles eventually come to rest on the ground (or surrounding surfaces).

“The studies suggesting that [the virus] can be aerosolized [i.e., linger as small particles in the air] are only preliminary, and other research contradicts it, finding no aerosolized coronavirus particles in the hospital rooms of Covid-19 patients,” Stat reports. More research is needed.

So all three transmission routes — droplets, airborne, and fecal — are still possible contributors to the spread of the virus. “Almost certainly, one of these is probably the predominant one, and the others might be minor modes of transmission, but we don’t really understand this,” Hotez says. Some good news is that scientists are figuring out how long the virus can live on some surfaces. Here’s the latest: It’s around three days for plastic and steel, about a day for cardboard, and less than a day for copper. This information helps direct sanitation efforts to where they are needed most.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

2) Can people become reinfected? And, if so, after how long?

Another huge unknown: Can people become reinfected with Covid-19 after they’ve had it? There are some reports of people in China and Japan testing positive after recovering from the infection. Though, to be clear, it’s unknown whether those people were truly reinfected or still just had low levels of the virus in their systems after they felt better.

“I would say that the biggest unknown is how potent is the immune response generated in an infected person,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, writes in an email. “How long would [immune] protection last? ... The answers to these questions are key to understanding whether herd immunity is effective.“

Herd immunity is when enough people have contracted the virus and become immune that its spread can be slowed and potentially stopped. If reinfection is possible, however, herd immunity may not be an option. (Also, stopping the virus via herd immunity is not an ideal scenario. It would first mean millions upon millions of infections and potentially millions of deaths.)

Right now, there’s limited research on the question of reinfection in humans. It’s just too early. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, points to a hopeful, if small, study in Macaque monkeys. The monkeys had been infected with the virus and then, after they got better, exposed again to the virus. Good news: They didn’t get reinfected. The study, Rasmussen says, “bodes well for vaccine development, because that suggests the virus — or viral proteins — can elicit an immune response,” and protect monkeys at least from reinfection.

Studies on humans will come in time. Researchers will be able to test the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19 in the weeks and months following their infection and see if they still are immune.

But even if people do become immune, “one thing we don’t know about that still is how long that immunity would last,” Rasmussen says. “And that’s unfortunately not something we can determine until we wait months or years in the future, and test again and see if those antibodies are still there.”

For coronaviruses that cause the common cold (in the same family of viruses as the one that causes Covid-19), she says, reinfection is possible, but on a timescale of years, not weeks or months. Again, we’re going to have to wait and see if this also applies to Covid-19.

For now, at least, Rasmussen says, “I have not seen any data that is convincing that reinfection occurs.”

3) How many cases of Covid-19 are in the US, and where are we on the curve?

This is one of the scariest unknowns. Due to the continued lack of Covid-19 diagnostic testing in most of the US, we just don’t know how many cases are in the US.

“There’s speculation that there may be many mild infections who aren’t seeking care — or, even if they are, can’t be tested due to insufficient testing capacity,” says Harvard epidemiologist Maimuna Majumder. This obfuscates our knowledge of where the virus is, and how many vulnerable people may be in its path.

Repeating my plea to media: PLEASE stop saying ""there are now X number of cases in the US"" and start saying ""as of today X cases have been reported in the US. Because of limited testing, experts agree the real number is far higher."" We don't know how much higher but many times — Marc Lipsitch (@mlipsitch) March 15, 2020

As of March 19, the CDC said there were 10,442 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US. But viral genetic data suggests the real number could be much higher. Here is one estimate from a computational virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle (with a very wide range) from nearly a week ago;

I could easily be off 2-fold in either direction, but my best guess is that we're currently in the 10,000 to 40,000 range nationally. 11/13 — Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) March 14, 2020

Another problem with insufficient testing is that we don't know where we are on the epidemic curve. How do we know when the worst spikes in the number of cases are coming? It seems we’re early, but we don’t know how early or how big the wave of future cases is. We need to know this to make sure hospitals are prepared for a surge of patients.

If we know how many people are getting the disease without symptoms or getting it at a level that does not warrant medical attention, scientists can make better estimates for how deadly the virus is and for whom, and they can refine their assumptions about how contagious the virus is. More testing can also help researchers determine the true role asymptomatic transmission plays in the outbreak, and what factors make a person likely to transmit the virus before they feel sick.

4) How deadly, exactly, is Covid-19?

Knowing the true number of infections that exist in the US or around the globe (or at least getting a better estimate of the true number) will help researchers determine another crucial metric about Covid-19: its case fatality rate, meaning how deadly it is.

Right now, it’s looking like some countries have higher death rates for Covid-19 than others. These rates also keep changing. Now, the estimated death rate for Wuhan, China — the city where the outbreak began — is 1.4 percent, per a new study in Nature Medicine. In late February, the World Health Organization estimated the rate in Wuhan was 5.8 percent. South Korea, on the other hand, was estimated to have a death rate of less than 1 percent. Italy’s seems to be, for now, several percentage points higher.

Are these estimates different because the citizens of these countries are at different levels of risk for some yet-to-be-determined variables? Are their caregivers better at treating the virus? Or are their health care systems falling short in the testing of cases? All of these questions may be in play.

It’s also the case that the fatality rate can change over time, as Belluz explains:

CFRs do change over time. That’s exactly what happened in China, as you can see in this figure from the WHO. Even the first and hardest-hit province, Hubei, saw its death rate tumble as public health measures were strengthened and clinicians got better at identifying and treating people with the disease:

Crucially, it’s not just the overall CFR that matters but also the knowledge of who is most at risk for death. It does seem clear that older people — particularly those older than 80 — and those with chronic medical conditions are in the riskiest group for dying of Covid-19. But we need more knowledge on other subgroups so we can better protect them.

5) Is it seasonal?

For a variety of reasons, some viruses — but not all — become less transmissible as temperatures and humidity rise in the summer months. The viruses themselves may not live as long on surfaces in these conditions. The droplets that transmit the virus also may not spread as far in humid air. (When the air contains more water vapor, those virus droplets will collide with water molecules more frequently and may not travel as far. The humid air is kind of like a shield for virus-containing droplets.) Also, human behavior changes, and we spend less time in confined spaces.

“A lot of how the outbreak ends or at least how things progress in the next few months really depends on if this is seasonal,” Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, says.

There are actually two important questions here. The first: Will Covid-19 show seasonal effects? The second: Will those seasonal effects make a meaningful difference in slowing down the spread of the pandemic?

The answer to the first question, right now, is maybe.

Mauricio Santillana, the director of the Machine Intelligence Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, has been studying the potential seasonality of Covid-19 by looking at the best available data from China.

Before China instituted massive lockdowns, “we saw a signature that places that were colder and drier showed slightly larger transmissions before interventions,” Santillana says. Though he admits the data is limited, and it’s hard to analyze the exact impact temperature and humidity have on transmission. That’s because, once China locked down, it became hard to disentangle the effects weather has on transmission from the mitigation policies from the government. Santillana and his colleagues are still working out what exact effect the weather may have on transmissibility, and he says it’s too soon to report a specific number.

But be prepared to be disappointed on this. On the second question, Santillana is firmer: “We cannot rely on weather alone to take care of the outbreak,” he says, pointing to warmer and more humid climates — like in Singapore — where the virus has spread. “We think the spring temperatures will not be enough to mitigate the outbreak.”

It’s just too contagious — and too few people are immune.

That said, it’s not futile to keep studying seasonality effects. “This virus may be with us for the coming years,” Santillana says. Predicting spikes based on weather, however small, will give us “a more precise way to deploy resources around the world.”

6) What role do children play in the spread of Covid-19? And why aren’t they getting very sick with it?

“When there’s an influenza epidemic, kids are often some of the biggest community spreaders,” Hotez explains.

But with Covid-19, kids generally don’t seem to be getting severely ill. Which is leading researchers to ask: Are kids a big source of transmission of this virus? “When we’re talking about closing schools, we’re doing that under the assumption that kids are significant community transmitters,” Hotez says. “If we knew that one way or another, we could make a more informed decision.”

On this, the data is slowly coming in.

“We do know that children tend to have more mild infection, have more mild disease, but we have seen [at least one child] die from this infection,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 technical lead at the World Health Organization, said in a press conference on March 16. “We can’t say universally that it’s mild in children, so it’s important that we protect children as a vulnerable population.”

While kids usually seem to be spared the worst, so many questions remain, as Vox’s Umair Irfan explains: “A small percentage of younger people, from babies to young adults, have also suffered serious harm,” he writes. “Few children are being tested for the virus, so there still isn’t much good information about how many children are getting infected overall. And from there, it’s hard to gauge the rate of severe illness for the young.”

7) What leads some people to be at higher risk for the worst symptoms of Covid-19?

On the question of risk factors, there seems to be one clear answer for the most prominent factor: age. Older people appear to be dying in much higher numbers from Covid-19 than younger people.

But we still don’t know a lot about what else contributes to risk. Even among older people, there are unanswered questions. Like why do men appear to be dying at higher rates than women?

Though the risks to older people are being emphasized, young people are also being hospitalized. New data from the CDC now shows that while Covid-19 is currently less than 1 percent fatal among those ages 20 to 54, this group makes up 38 percent of the hospitalizations so far (with 20 percent of the hospitalization occurring among those ages 22 to 44).

“It’s really an open question to try to figure out why some of these younger people are getting really, really severe disease, and if there are other risk factors that we are not appreciating,” Rasmussen says. “Some of that will just have to wait until we have really detailed clinical data on all the cases that are coming out now in Italy and in the United States.” Knowing who is most at risk, she says, “will help in terms of flattening the curve.” If we learn how to protect the young people most at risk and keep them out of hospitals, we can decrease strain on our health care system.

And a big part of keeping the health care system working well is ensuring its workers — who are often in this 20- to 54-year-old group — remain healthy. “We don’t understand why hospital workers also seem to be at higher risk for severe disease than you would expect based on their age,” Hotez says. “Is it just that they get exposed to a large dose of the virus? Do they have some type of susceptibility that we don’t understand?”

Currently, we don’t know.

8) How, exactly, did it start?

This is still a little bit of a mystery. Scientists know this virus jumped from an animal to a human, but they are not sure exactly how or where. “If you don’t understand where it came from, then it’s hard to make policies, procedures, to prevent it from happening again,” says Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician and Emerging Leader in Biosecurity fellow at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.

It likely started with a bat — the genetics of the novel coronavirus suggest that it did. As Vox’s Eliza Barclay reported:

What researchers have to figure out now is how exactly the coronavirus jumped to humans: perhaps through a human eating an infected animal, or through humans being exposed to infected feces or urine. “All we know [is] its likely distant source was bats, but we don’t know who was between bats and people,” said Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia and host of the This Week in Virology podcast. “It could be a direct infection [between bats and humans] as well.”

A lot of the evidence points toward the outbreak either starting or significantly gaining steam at a live animal market in Wuhan, China. The more we know about how this virus made the jump from animals to humans, the more authorities can help make sure an outbreak with this origin doesn’t happen again.

9) When will it end? And how? Will it become endemic?

The response to the Covid-19 pandemic is infiltrating every aspect of life, and we’re already longing for it to end. But this fight may not end for months or a year or even more. It’s also possible that Covid-19 will become endemic, meaning it becomes a disease that regularly infects humans and never really goes away.

But there are so many unknowns that will determine how long we have to live with this:

Could a pharmaceutical treatment emerge that will prevent people from dying from Covid-19? (Many drugs, including HIV-fighting antivirals, and common, cheap ones — like those to ward off malaria — are being tested right now, or may be tested soon.)

Will one of the many vaccine formulations that have been created in recent weeks (some of those trials are already underway) prove to be safe and effective?

If no drug works to treat the virus or stop its spread, we may need to live with strict social distancing for many months, if not a year or more, to prevent hundreds of thousands from dying. Will governments support that level of sustained disruption to the economy? Or could we find an alternative, like aggressive testing coupled with relentless contact tracing, quarantines of those exposed, and isolation of the sick?

As we learn more about this disease, our approach to fighting it will become more precise. We may be able to find a balance between protecting the vulnerable and letting our economy and society function again. But for now, we have to confront the possibility that this virus will disrupt life for a long while.

“I think this idea … that if you close schools and shut restaurants for a couple of weeks, you solve the problem and get back to normal life — that’s not what’s going to happen,” says Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and author of The Rules of Contagion, a book on how outbreaks spread. “The main message that isn’t getting across to a lot of people is just how long we might be in this for.”

But given that scientists have only known about this virus for a few short months, “it’s actually quite remarkable how much we’ve learned,” Hotez says. “We’ve learned more information about this virus in this short period of time than any other virus.”

The learning won’t stop. And because of that, hopefully, the spread of this pandemic someday will.",vox,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/20/21173472/coronavirus-pandemic-unknowns-questions-seasonality-reinfection-covid-19
"['Kelsey Piper', 'May']",2020-05-02,This coronavirus model keeps being wrong. Why are we still listening to it?,"This coronavirus model keeps being wrong. Why are we still listening to it?

Share All sharing options for: This coronavirus model keeps being wrong. Why are we still listening to it?

How many people are likely to die in the United States of Covid-19? How many hospital beds is the country going to need? When will case numbers peak?

To answer those questions, many hospital planners, media outlets, and government bodies — including the White House — relied heavily on one particular model out of the many that have been published in the past two months: the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

The model first estimated in late March that there’d be fewer than 161,000 deaths total in the US; in early April, it revised its projections to say the total death toll through August was “projected to be 60,415” (though it acknowledged the range could be between 31,221 and 126,703).

The model has been cited often by the White House and has informed its policymaking. But it may have led the administration astray: The IHME has consistently forecast many fewer deaths than most other models, largely because the IHME model projects that deaths will decline rapidly after the peak — an assumption that has not been borne out.

On Wednesday, the US death count passed the 60,000 mark that the IHME model had said was the likely total cumulative death toll. The IHME on April 29 released a new update raising its estimates for total deaths to 72,433, but that, too, looks likely to be proved an underestimate as soon as next week. Even its upper bound on deaths — now listed as 114,228 by August — is questionable, as some other models expect the US will hit that milestone by the end of May, and most project it will in June.

One analysis of the IHME model found that its next-day death predictions for each state were outside its 95 percent confidence interval 70 percent of the time — meaning the actual death numbers fell outside the range it projected 70 percent of the time. That’s not great! (A recent revision by IHME fixed that issue; more on this below.)

This track record has led some experts to criticize the model. “It’s not a model that most of us in the infectious disease epidemiology field think is well suited” to making projections about Covid-19, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told reporters.

But if that’s the case, how has it risen to such prominence among policymakers? Other models have done better than IHME’s at predicting the course of the epidemic, and many of them use approaches epidemiologists believe are more promising. Yet it’s the IHME model that has generally guided policymakers, for the most part, in the direction of focusing on a return to normal.

One potential explanation for its outsize influence: Some of the factors that make the IHME model unreliable at predicting the virus may have gotten people to pay attention to it. For one thing, it’s more simplistic compared to other models. That means it can be applied in ways more complicated models could not, such as providing state-level projections (something state officials really wanted), which other modelers acknowledged that they didn’t have enough data to offer.

Meanwhile, its narrow confidence intervals for state-by-state estimates meant it had quotable (and optimistic) topline numbers. A confidence interval represents a range of numbers wherein the model is very confident the true value will lie. A narrow range that gives “an appearance of certainty is seductive when the world is desperate to know what lies ahead,” a criticism of the IHME model published in the Annals of Internal Medicine argued. But the numbers and precise curves the IHME is publishing “suggests greater precision than the model is able to offer.”

The criticism of the IHME model, and an emerging debate over epidemiology models more broadly, has brought to light important challenges in the fight against the coronavirus. Good planning requires good projections. Models are needed to help predict resurgences and spot a potential second wave. Dissecting what the IHME model got wrong, what other models got right, and how the public and policymakers read these models is essential work in order to create the best pandemic plans possible.

What’s wrong with the IHME model of the coronavirus?

Models of disease spread are meant to help decision-makers in an environment where math will outperform intuitions. Most people have a hard time thinking about exponential growth, which is why many were taken by surprise in March as the virus spread. That’s why models can be useful.

Models usually lay out some foundational assumptions and offer projections based on those assumptions. The IHME model seeks to project death rates and hospitalization rates assuming widespread social distancing and strong measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Since testing is so unreliable at identifying the infection rate, the model uses only death rates as data (though evidence from all-cause mortality data suggests we’re undercounting coronavirus-caused deaths, too).

That projected hospitalization rate was one of the things that set it apart, IHME researcher Ali Mokdad told me. It was one of the few models offering that projection, and it was actionable information governments could grab on to and plan around.

Another reason it rose in prominence was IHME’s decision to model the effects of strong social distancing measures. That choice proved correct — strong measures were indeed taken across the US — and the lower death numbers the model churned out as a result reportedly led to it being received favorably by the Trump administration.

But as the weeks have passed, it has become clear that the IHME’s projections have been too optimistic, and slow to adjust to reflect the fact that deaths have plateaued rather than rapidly decreasing to zero. The IHME has been regularly updating its model as new data comes in, but the updates have often been slow enough that the numbers are absurd by the time they’re changed in an update. For example, in late April the model still stated the expected total death toll was 60,000, even as the US was clearly only a few days from that milestone.

Mokdad told me when we talked that a fix was in the works, and it went up a few days later: The model now projects 73,433 deaths by August. That, too, is probably an underestimate — most other models project that total will be reached next week.

In the IHME’s defense, it does offer a 95 percent confidence interval that is more accurate than the topline numbers. That range goes from 59,343 — significantly less than the number of people already dead of the virus — to 114,228. That might sound like a wide range, but it’s still optimistic, and the actual toll is on track to lie outside that range entirely. MIT projects the US will surpass that upper bound in mid-June, and the Los Alamos forecast, like the MIT one, predicts the country will burst through the IHME’s 95 percent confidence interval in around six weeks.

That’s one of the core complaints about the IHME model: its confidence intervals seem too narrow, both for its next-day and several-months-ahead predictions. For instance, when used to predict the number of deaths in a state the very next day (which doesn’t require any complex modeling of the long-term effects of uncertain policies), other researchers found the true deaths were outside of the 95 percent confidence interval given by the model 70 percent of the time. Those are embarrassingly poor results.

The day-to-day numbers are jumpy because some counties don’t report numbers every day, Mokdad told me. “The model is kind of confused because states are not reporting deaths consistently,” he said, adding, “The model assumes deaths will increase and then come back down,” and so it reacts poorly when deaths instead vary day to day. Smoothing over the course of a week — the latest update the IHME team made — means the model should be more predictive.

Indeed, the latest update to the model solves the problem where the next-day deaths are usually outside the model’s confidence interval by giving the model extremely wide confidence intervals. That’s commendable. It is better to be honest about your extremely high uncertainty than to claim certainty you don’t have.

That might lead to unsatisfying models with extremely wide ranges — 176 to 3,885 deaths today — but if that’s an accurate reflection of the state of uncertainty, then so be it. It’s better to have a wide confidence interval, acknowledging your uncertainty, than to have a narrow one that is usually wrong. And if next-day deaths are usually wrong, as IHME’s are, that undermines confidence in the long-term predictive value of the model.

(But while the IHME has made its day-to-day confidence intervals larger, it still has very narrow confidence intervals for its projections several weeks into the future — which is odd, as there should be even more uncertainty about those.)

An even bigger issue with the IHME model is that the way the model is published can obscure its problems. When it’s updated, it can be hard to see what its old, obviated predictions were. A website, covid-projections.com, has been set up so that you can look at the predictions made by old versions of the IHME model (and at the history of other models). The IHME models are frequently fairly far off.

The IHME model is unusual compared to other epidemiological models for its design, too. While most of the models use standard epidemiology modeling tactics like SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered modeling) or use computer simulations, the IHME model is effectively just about fitting a curve from early data in China and Italy to the disease’s trajectory elsewhere.

The IHME model is based “on a statistical model with no epidemiologic basis,” the Annals of Internal Medicine critique argues.

The IHME team has defended its model against those complaints.

“We’re willing to make a forecast. Most academics want to hedge their bets and not be found to ever be wrong,” IHME director Christopher Murray told Politico. “That’s not useful for a planner — you can’t go to a hospital and say you might need 1,000 ventilators, or you might need 5,000.”

The model has gotten better, but flaws remain

The change to the model has certainly improved it, but some problems with the confidence intervals remain. The new model acknowledges extremely high uncertainty about what will happen tomorrow — in my state, California, it says there will be between 5 and 103 deaths tomorrow. That’s a really wide range.

But on May 20, the model is entirely sure there will be zero deaths. The 95 percent confidence interval runs from zero deaths to ... zero deaths.

That’s an extremely strong claim. I pressed the IHME team about whether they were sure of it. Mokdad said the model’s zero-deaths predictions were correct: “Based on the graph, in certain states, yes — in California, May 17, zero. The virus is not circulating anymore; you would expect it to go to zero.”

But the virus is still circulating in California. On April 28, there were 1,187 new cases reported in the state. Even if all infections in California stopped instantly today, it is likely that some already infected people would die in mid-May or later.

California’s case numbers (like those of many states) are declining, but only slowly, as social distancing has limited the spread of the virus but not fully stopped it. That ties into another problem with the IHME model: It assumes that social distancing measures, once put in place, are always sufficient to rapidly decrease case numbers to zero.

In the report explaining the model, the researchers write that they look at four measures: “School closures, non-essential business closures including bars and restaurants, stay-at-home recommendations, and travel restrictions including public transport closures. Days with 1 measure were counted as 0.67 equivalents, days with 2 measures as 0.334 equivalents and with 3 or 4 measures as 0.”

In other words, the model has a built-in assumption that once three of those measures have been put into place, cases will rapidly fall to zero. No new data can change that assumption, which is why the model continues to project zero deaths by mid-May in any area that hasn’t lifted social distancing restrictions, even though case numbers have only plateaued rather than declined in many areas.

There are many similar frustratingly confident predictions: On July 12, the model says, we’ll need between 0 and 12 hospital beds in the whole US for coronavirus patients, and there will be 0 deaths at any point after July 12.

Why the IHME model’s problems shouldn’t be used as an indictment of epidemiology more broadly

All these concerns make it frustrating to many epidemiologists that the IHME model is the one being widely used and cited. “That the IHME model keeps changing is evidence of its lack of reliability as a predictive tool,” epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni told Stat News in an article about the problems with the model. “That it is being used for policy decisions and its results interpreted wrongly is a travesty unfolding before our eyes.”

Alex Merz, a microbiologist at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine, has written that “@IHME_UW’s overly optimistic modeling projections contributed to this debacle” of the coronavirus’s rapid spread in the US, and condemned their “amazing shrinking error band that, preposterously, constricts to zero uncertainty in mid-June. That is not only bad science communication — it is bad science.”

The IHME model has also brought the discipline under fire from other fields. Tyler Cowen, whose widely read blog Marginal Revolution has linked many of the papers demonstrating how poorly the IHME model works, argued “now really is the time to be asking tough questions about epidemiology, and yes, epidemiologists.”

That’s not fair, many epidemiologists say — the model doesn’t use any of the standard tools of the discipline, and they hate it too.

“That the IHME model keeps changing is evidence of its lack of reliability as a predictive tool”

“The IHME approach departs from classic epidemiological modeling,” epidemiological modelers at the University of Texas at Austin argued. “Rather than using systems of equations to project the person-to-person transmission of the virus, the [IHME] model postulates that COVID-19 deaths will rise exponentially and then decline in a pattern that roughly resembles a bell curve (i.e., normal distribution).” (Their paper puts forward their own attempt at modeling the disease with a curve-fitting approach, but one tweaked to use better data and to better represent uncertainty.)

So it might not be fair to draw conclusions about the field as a whole from one model that mostly avoided using its standard tools.

Moreover, the public should be aware that there are better models. The Imperial College model that the British government relied on to inform their country’s coronavirus strategy has held up reasonably well, with case numbers loosely tracking the model’s predictions for what would happen if social distancing were implemented (as it was shortly after the model was published). It, too, has been frequently revised in response to new data and has come under criticism for overconfidence, but the inaccuracies are smaller and less pervasive, and the initial numbers before any revisions weren’t that far off.

Other models, employing more standard epidemiological approaches, perform even better — though usually in narrower domains, like trying to project just the peak of the outbreak, or just the rate of new cases.

The IHME team says their model performed pretty well on key problems like predicting the peak in most states (it’ll be clear in coming weeks how true that is) and that they’re continuing to revise it to make it better. Meanwhile, as the debate over epidemiological models heats up, it’s fair to say that holding the shortcomings of the IHME model against epidemiology as a whole isn’t fair.

We don’t have all the answers

But that still leaves the question: Why did the IHME model become so popular?

The flaws I’ve noted above were also features that made the model appealing when it was first launched. It was optimistic, projecting lower deaths than other models. It was clear and precise, with narrow confidence intervals. It projected hospitalizations, which few others were doing — though those projections turned out to be wrong because not enough was known to project hospitalizations well at that stage. In a time of uncertainty, the IHME model was compelling.

But it turns out the uncertainty being reflected in a lot of other, better models is showing up for a reason — there really is still a lot unknown about the course this disease will take.

As my colleague Matt Yglesias has written, “We need to value scientists and listen to experts, but part of listening means understanding that right now, what they’re saying is that they do not have all the answers.”

Given the enormous uncertainty ahead, responsible scientists are avoiding giving dramatic topline numbers they’re unsure of, emphasizing the very wide confidence intervals on their estimates, and being careful not to publish results that the Trump administration or the public may interpret as definitive.

But people keep searching for definitive answers (understandably so), and so any model that is presented more confidently will rise to prominence over models that are humbler and better reflect the confusion.

The IHME model is one of several released by researchers at the University of Washington, but it has been far more widely cited and discussed than the others — despite being less accurate.

Ultimately, the problem may not be that some models are inaccurate. It was predictable that some models would be inaccurate, with the situation as confusing as it is. There are dozens of models, and ideally we’d be doing something like aggregating them and weighting each according to how well it has performed so far in predicting the crisis.

The current process is almost exactly the opposite of that. Most models are nearly ignored, while a few are cited by the White House and widely referred to in the press. The process that makes some models prominent is not a process that picks out the best of the best — and in fact, it may actively be picking out worse models, by emphasizing ones with notable numbers and statistics to cite, by leaning into the seductive “appearance of certainty” that researchers have warned about.

In other words, the fact that many epidemiological models are performing badly isn’t great, but it could be part of a productive process of arriving at better models. But the media, policymakers, and the public need to be conscious of what kind of models we gravitate to and why. If we elevate the ones we like and quote numbers from them as if they’re definitive, then the models will certainly end up shedding more heat than light.

"['Dylan Scott Emily Stewart', 'Dylan Scott', 'Emily Stewart', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-09,When will the economy be good again?,"We know the US economy is bad right now. Millions of people have lost their jobs, and millions more will. Estimates for how much unemployment is expected to spike and GDP will fall are staggering. Production and spending across much of the country have been brought to an abrupt halt.

It’s natural to want to see a light at the end of the tunnel, obviously in terms of the health crisis caused by coronavirus but also for the economy. And there will be one — eventually.

“The very best-case scenario is we rapidly bounce back and we get close to something where we were before. Personally, I think that’s highly unlikely. The shock from the virus is going to trigger a broader economy-wide recession,” said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan. “That’s a really harsh reality.”

Related Coronavirus could lead to the highest unemployment levels since the Great Depression

The question of when and how the economy gets better largely hinges on our ability to get the virus itself under control. Despite calls from some Republican lawmakers to get back to business before that happens and even some speculation about reopening the economy early from the president, it’s not a realistic scenario — people likely aren’t going to be falling over themselves to go out to restaurants and pack into movie theaters as a deadly virus spreads, or as they or their loved ones get sick.

At some point — and we don’t know exactly when — the economy will bounce back, at least partially. When it does, that new normal will be different. Many Americans may be worse off than they were before, some people may still be afraid to resume their lives as they once lived them, and many businesses may have permanently closed.

“There will likely be some permanent damage inflicted on the economy,” says Greg Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. “What this shock is doing is exacerbating preexisting inequality issues across the country. The individuals who have been hit the hardest are the individuals who were in the most precarious position to start with.”

Economists say it could be anywhere from 2021 to 2031 before the economy returns to something like the pre-coronavirus “normal.” But it may never be entirely the same.

“We’ve never seen anything like this before, so we’re speculating along with everyone else,” Edgerton said.

What the economic recovery will look like: Contraction, a partial bounceback, and the long slog

The first prerequisite for economic recovery will be a public health solution: widespread testing, tracing of possible infections, antibody testing for immunity, adequate supplies for the health care system, and so on. The coronavirus outbreak will need to be firmly under control before the economy can resume anything approaching normalcy, and we just don’t know yet when the public health breakthrough will happen. Consumers need confidence that participating in the economy won’t get them or their loved ones sick before they will revert to their typical economic activity.

“The longer these issues linger in the form of people not having confidence in returning to their daily activities,” Daco said, “the more severe these dislocations will be.”

But once that has been achieved, the problems and solutions we are dealing with will become more recognizably economic. Jason Furman, a former top economist for President Barack Obama who is now at Harvard, told Vox the economic fallout and recovery will likely have three stages:

Contraction: That’s what Americans are experiencing right now, with millions of people losing their jobs while business investment and consumer spending fall off precipitously. A partial bounceback: Once society starts to reopen, there will be a lot of hiring and spending and investment to ignite the recovery, but that is unlikely to bring the economy all the way back to where it was in January 2020. The long slog: After the initial but incomplete improvement, it may take a long time for unemployment and wages to return to levels similar to the pre-coronavirus economy.

The timeline for the second and third steps is difficult to know. The recovery is likely to look robust at first; Furman suggested we could see some of the most impressive job gains (a million or more in a month) and GDP growth numbers ever. Parts of the economy should be able to snap back to something approximating their pre-crisis state.

And such a quick recovery could be self-reinforcing, at least up to a point.

“If the economy starts surging back, then some businesses will suddenly face insufficient capacity. Those businesses will have to double down on hiring, ordering supplies and investment in new equipment, capital, etc.,” Karl Smith, vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the Tax Foundation, says. “That then provides an extra boost of demand for the rest of the economy that produces a secondary wave of investment.”

While it’s not possible to rule out a rapid and complete return to normalcy — a V-shaped recovery, in the economists’ lingo — most experts we spoke to consider it unlikely. Too much structural damage has been done, jobs and businesses lost that will never come back. Supply chains have been broken and need to be rebuilt.

Americans are more likely to find themselves in something like the 2011 or 2012 environment after the Great Recession: The economy is no longer the biggest story in the world, but the unemployment rate will be high and wages will still be depressed. It’s helpful to remember how the economic recovery began last time around in June 2009, when the national unemployment rate was at 9.5 percent. A year later in 2010, it was stuck at 9.4 percent. In 2011, it was 8.2 percent. Unemployment didn’t fall below 5 percent until early 2016. And in this crisis, the unemployment rate is expected to have an even higher peak.

“The shock from the virus ... is going to be enough to tip off at least a normal recession in the rest of the economy beyond these direct effects of the sectors that we have had to shut down. ... We should expect the next nine months or a year to look like a recession, to continue to see high levels of unemployment and depressed levels of output,” Edgerton said. He predicted that “it will be at least a few years before we feel as good as we did in January.”

How long this lasts, and what the recovery looks like, depends on actions while the health crisis is still underway. The government has passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to try to prop up the economy in the meantime, and more federal spending will be needed. But transitioning from stimulus provisions to a normal economy can be tricky.

Smith pointed out the enhanced unemployment aid will be a boon to consumer demand in the short term while depressing labor supply, but as soon as it’s cut off, demand could drop because people have less money to spend and not everyone will get a new job immediately. (One way to avoid that: a phase-out of some kind.)

“It really depends, to my mind, on just how much damage is done during the time that the economy is shut down in the way it is now,” said former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in a recent interview with CNBC. The more workers are laid off, the more households that run down their savings, the more people who fall behind on their bills, the longer the slog of recovery.

The recovery can take many shapes if you think of it as a line graph: a V, a U or, worst of all, an L (sharp sudden drop and long gradual climb). Yellen said, “The more damage of that sort is done, the more likely we are to see a U, and there are worse letters, too, like L, and I hope we don’t see something like that.”

Inequality could get worse because low-wage workers getting hit the hardest

Just as we saw after prior economic crises, not everybody will experience the same recovery. For the wealthy and higher-income people, those who didn’t lose their jobs and whose financial well-being was more marginally affected, they may bounce back to normal quickly once they go back to work full time and the stock market starts to improve.

“There will be some individuals who have V-shaped recovery,” Claudia Sahm, who worked a the Federal Reserve through the 2008 recession and is now director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, says. “The people who came into this with a good financial position … they’re gonna be fine.”

But the job market for low-wage workers is probably going to look a lot worse, even as the broader economy starts to pull out of the coronavirus recession.

At the beginning of this year, the unemployment rate was down around 3 percent and wages were ticking up. That’s basic supply and demand: There weren’t a lot of workers out there looking for a job, so firms had to raise wages to be competitive. But that new reality, which took years to reach after the Great Recession, has been dismantled.

We already know that low-wage service sector jobs were the most vulnerable to being cut because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

And when the public health crisis is over and life starts to return to normal, unemployment could be 15 or even 20 percent. There are going to be a lot of workers looking to fill those open slots, especially as the emergency unemployment benefits in the stimulus bill start to expire.

“Wages are going to come out of the recovery worse than they were,” Sahm says. “Everything is going to be worse for workers who went into the recession in the most fragile position, and there are a lot of them.”

The horizon for workers may shake out differently depending on geography. University of California Berkeley economist Danny Yagan found that after the Great Recession, workers who lived in places that were hard hit by the recession were less likely to be employed at all in 2015, even if the local unemployment rate had recovered. It appears that years later, some people in the most affected areas had just given up looking for work altogether.

The economic crisis may exacerbate racial income inequality as well. In 2015, a report from the ACLU estimated that by 2031, wealth for white households would be 31 percent less than it would have been had the Great Recession never happened. For black households, it would be down nearly 40 percent. And the coronavirus crisis is already hitting black communities especially hard. Early numbers suggest black people are at higher risk for contracting and dying of coronavirus, and a smaller proportion of black and Hispanic workers are able to work from home compared to Asian Americans and whites.

“We know that blacks, Latinx, and native people, in terms of race and ethnicity, they have lower levels of reserves, and we also know that their employment is more precarious than that of white people,” Darrick Hamilton, the executive director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University, recently told Vox.

Some parts of the economy will never be the same

Maybe the hardest truth to accept, however, is that some things may never go back to the way they were.

The travel and hospitality industries could be in for a long depression of their own, depending on how quick people are to trust the safety of international travel or venturing far from their homes. This is where the public health response comes back into play: The sooner people feel confident about testing and infection tracing, confident enough to book a flight and a hotel room in some far-flung destination, the sooner those industries will be back to normal.

“Where I do see the potential for change, and I don’t know if it’s permanent or long-lasting, is travel,” Daco says. “There may be an environment of caution going forward in terms of travel. You’ll likely see a normalization in local services first, before you see a normalization in travel-related activity. People are still going to be cautious when it comes to boarding a plane and going on a vacation. The same may be true for business travel.”

The same goes for bars and restaurants, at least in the short term — it might be some time before people are comfortable crowding into such establishments, and many places may not survive the crisis. As much as you may be trying to order delivery to keep your local favorites afloat, you cannot order enough pad Thai to pay their rent. But, presumably, at some point, people will start going out to eat again like they once did.

It may take some time for live events to enjoy the audiences they once did, too, though Furman said he expects that at some point, the live entertainment industry will look pretty much the same as it did before the crisis.

And broadly speaking, we may see greater market concentration in sectors where many small businesses were lost. Congress has tried to prop up small businesses through loans approved in the stimulus package, but there are already reports of problems with the actual administration of those benefits. The more small businesses that close because of the initial economic shock or a problem accessing federal benefits, or both, the more the markets they leave behind will be concentrated among a handful of dominant players.

It’s certainly worth asking if Americans want the economy to go back to exactly the same way it was. The coronavirus crisis has exposed and exacerbated deep flaws in the US system, including the economy. Corporations that just got a massive tax cut may now not have many resources to weather the downturn. Why were large businesses able to spend much of that tax windfall on stock buybacks and executive compensation? Why haven’t workers been paid enough to build up savings to get by when they lose their jobs through no fault of their own? Where is the social safety net?

“In the United States, economic inequality has been on the steep incline for a long time, and there were many people already on the verge before this happened, systems already failing,” said Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University. “It just highlights all the cracks and the flaws and faults that already existed.”

"['Alanna Okun', 'Apr']",2020-04-01,Everything you need to know about making your own face mask,"For a while, it felt as though advice from health professionals was changing every day about whether most Americans should be wearing face masks to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has now officially recommended that everyone but infants should wear a cloth mask or face covering in certain public settings.

As German Lopez writes for Vox, “While the evidence is limited, the research suggests that more mask use by the greater public could help stop the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Some studies in households and colleges ‘show a benefit of masks,’ Raina MacIntyre, head of the Biosecurity Program at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, told me, ‘so it would be plausible that they would also protect in lower-intensity transmission settings such as in the general community.’”

The guidance had been frustratingly confusing, particularly in the midst of a pandemic where official directives have been inconsistent or outright dangerous, but it did lead to a spike in Americans taking matters into their own hands and donning masks before the official directive came, according to the Washington Post. The practice was already widespread in many parts of Asia, which some experts say could be one reason that areas like Hong Kong and South Korea seemed to do better at controlling the spread of the virus.

Above all, it’s of utmost importance that medical personnel, vulnerable populations, and people who actually have the virus are first in line when it comes to medical-grade personal protective equipment, or PPE. That’s why making your own — while it won’t come with nearly the same level of protection — could be an alternative and possibly reduce considerable strain on an already drastically overburdened supply chain.

I will not, here, write a cute and flip line about how you probably have a lot of time on your hands for craft projects now that you’re stuck inside, because maybe you have kids, or maybe you have a job that does not allow you to work from home, or a job that’s become infinitely more stressful now that you have to. I am literally a semi-professional crafter and even I can’t bring myself to stop panicking most days long enough to sit down and knit a couple of rows.

What I will do is answer some questions you might have about what goes into making a mask, even — especially! — if you yourself are not a crafter. If you have further questions or resources you’ve found helpful, email me and let me know; I’m alanna.okun@vox.com, and chances are this guide will be updated frequently as more information becomes available.

So wait, am I definitely supposed to be wearing a mask? Even if I’m not sick or vulnerable?

The guidance is now that every American (except infants) should wear some kind of face covering in public places where other social distancing measures are hard to maintain (like grocery stores or pharmacies), especially in communities with significant rates of transmission.

As Lopez previously wrote, the research is murky and inconclusive, but the main takeaway is that homemade masks are likely better than nothing: “Cloth masks ... are much less effective than the modern alternatives, as a 2015 study in BMJ found. And they can be extra risky, since they can trap and hold virus-containing droplets that wearers can then breathe in. But they still, in general, offer more protection than no mask at all, several studies concluded.”

Essentially, what you’re shooting for here is not ironclad protection but rather a bolstered line of defense for both yourself and, notably, the people around you. As Lopez writes:

Coronavirus appears to mostly spread when germ-containing droplets make it into a person’s mouth, nose, or eyes. If you have a physical barrier in front of your mouth and nose, that’s simply less likely to happen. ... While the evidence is thin on how much masks protect the wearer from coronavirus — since it’s unclear if the virus spreads much through airborne droplets — it’s true that the masks stop people from spreading their own droplets: When you breathe, talk, laugh, sigh, yawn, sneeze, or cough in public, you’re less likely to get droplets on a checkout machine, dining table, or anywhere else if you have a mask on. That could stop people, even those who are asymptomatic, from spreading infection.

Making a mask is also not a bad idea, practically speaking, because the buy-in is quite low, and the odds of you already owning the materials you need to make one (or several) are quite high. You probably won’t need to go out and purchase something new, and if you do, there are plenty of contact-free or online options available.

Okay, tell me about those materials

There are official guidelines from the CDC on what qualities homemade masks should have, such as including multiple layers of snug-fitting fabric and holding up to machine washing. It also suggests what types of fabric to seek out: “tightly woven cotton, such as quilting fabric or cotton sheets. T-shirt fabric will work in a pinch.”

Jo-Ann Stores is furnishing free, precut mask-making materials for donations to hospitals (more on that later), including curbside pickup. A tutorial the chain recommends, which comes from Froedtert Hospital & the Medical College of Wisconsin, suggests looking for 100 percent cotton, like denim or percale. Their rule of thumb is that if you fold the fabric in two layers, you shouldn’t be able to see through it but should still be able to breathe through it.

Old clothes can be an excellent source for this. I recently cleaned out my closet (this might sound like a brag, but I assure you I did it in The Before Times and the bags of unwanted garments have been sitting in my hall for weeks) and have a couple of pairs of ill-fitting jeans I’ll be using in order to make my own face mask and probably a cache for my unwitting coworkers.

Some of the no-sew tutorials don’t even require cutting up fabric; in those cases, handkerchiefs, cloth napkins, or scarves and bandanas could be used.

I’m okay at sewing, or at least have enough time on my hands to give it a try. Where can I find instructions?

The CDC has directions for a sewn option as well as two no-sew ones, which we’ll get to later, that calls for two 10x6 inch rectangles of fabric per mask. There’s also a useful step-by-step guide to homemade masks in the New York Times, which can be made either by hand or with a sewing machine, along with a somewhat more involved one that includes a printable template for cutting out the right size fabric.

I found this pleated machine sewing tutorial by blogger Sarah Maker to be pretty intuitive, especially because of the clear (and oddly calming) video accompanying the written-through steps; her version comprises two layers of fabric with a pocket for additional disposable inserts. It’s definitely on the higher end of the beginner crafting spectrum, though, and harder than the CDC’s method, so approach it accordingly — if you aren’t comfortable machine sewing seams and basic pleats, this will probably stress you out.

Please don’t say anything about “sewing” to me. Are there less DIY-intensive versions?

Deeply reasonable! Yes, there are, to a point. One thing to keep in mind is fit and proper wear — the likelihood that a homemade mask won’t fit you as securely is higher than with a medical-grade one, which will reduce its effectiveness, and something you’ve sewn to fit yourself will in turn probably be more snug than a piece of fabric you wrap around your face.

That said, you may in fact just need to wrap a piece of fabric around your face, if there’s no other alternative. In its guidance to people who are sick, the CDC recommends wearing a face mask around other people, but notes that “you may need to improvise a face mask using a scarf or bandana.” One of their suggested no-sew mask methods involves cutting up a T-shirt so your face covering fits more snugly.

If you’re looking for something halfway between those two poles, this tutorial from an online Japanese arts and crafts educator called Japanese Creations demonstrates how to make a no-sew mask using a handkerchief (or scarf or cloth napkin or other piece of fabric) and hair ties. If you don’t have hair ties, the tutorial suggests cutting the cuffs off of old socks or nylon tights, which is a technique you could use for any of the above tutorials as well. The CDC’s other no-sew methods uses this exact technique, with the addition of a trimmed coffee filter in the center for added filtration.

N.B. The music from the accompanying video is so soothing and yet triumphant that I’ve kept it on in the background basically the whole time I’ve been working on this article.

How should I care for my homemade mask?

The CDC suggests that all cloth masks should “be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape” and that they “should be routinely washed depending on frequency of use.” It also notes that people should take care not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth while removing and affixing a mask, and that hands should be washed immediately after.

Does wearing a homemade mask mean I can ease up on following social distancing guidance?

No, it does not! If you’re able, you should absolutely be flattening the curve by staying home, washing your hands frequently, and avoiding other people. This is, again, a last-line of defense and is no excuse to FROLIC or MINGLE.

Where can I donate masks I’ve sewn?

It will vary widely by medical institution; some hospitals are accepting handmade donations to bolster dwindling supplies of medical-grade masks while others aren’t, and those policies might shift over time. It’s best to reach out to a medical facility or intermediary directly before simply dropping off a sackful of masks.

To that end, the Sewing and Craft Alliance has put together a regularly updated database, called WeNeedMasks.org, of institutions requesting supplies. While it might make the most sense and feel the most personally fulfilling to make masks for a hospital in your area, many places are also accepting donations by mail.

“We are happy to be able to provide this connection,” the site’s FAQ page reads, “but will be happier when we can safely say that we’re closing it down because proper personal protection equipment is readily available to all healthcare workers again.”

The most triumph-of-the-human-spirit-y I’ve felt since the beginning of this pandemic was when I first read Rebecca Jennings’s piece for The Goods about crafters stepping up to donate handmade masks and other PPE to hospitals. It’s not a solution to the shortage by any means; some DIY groups, which have gathered on Facebook and across the internet, are making mask liners to prolong the lives of N95 respirators, while others are scrambling to adhere to ever-changing directives on what hospitals need. Still, as an ICU nurse who helps facilitate one of these groups said, “It’s the best we can do for now.”

She’s right, and that goes for the act of making a mask, too. It feels really, really good to create something, just to feel like you have some small measure of control in the face of confusion and fear. It feels even better when that something might provide you, or someone you love, or a complete stranger, with a small measure of security.

Update, April 6: This piece has been updated to include new information from the CDC regarding homemade mask guidance.

"['Umair Irfan', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Remdesivir receives emergency approval as a Covid-19 treatment,"The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized remdesivir, an experimental antiviral drug, for emergency use to treat Covid-19.

The authorization allows the intravenous drug to be distributed to doctors, who can administer it to patients with severe cases of the disease, namely patients with low blood oxygen or those needing breathing assistance from a mechanical ventilator.

Many health experts have had high hopes for the drug, which was initially developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola, and it has since been used in experiments to treat the coronaviruses SARS and MERS. That early testing gave remdesivir a head start in the race toward a treatment for Covid-19.

But despite the release of some early study results this week, it’s still not clear how effective the drug is at fighting the virus, and more research is needed before it can be used as the default treatment.

Remdesivir previously showed some success in animal models. Now, early results from a clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) show that Covid-19 patients who took remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those prescribed a placebo. An internal study from Gilead also found that the drug was just as effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters at the White House on April 29 that he thought the findings were significant.

“This is really quite important,” he said. “This will be the standard of care.”

But a randomized trial of the drug in China recently published in the Lancet found that there was no statistical benefit to taking the drug.

Taken together, the studies highlight the need for more studies. Remdesivir may or may not work, but it’s hard to say based on the evidence available at this point.

Trials haven’t revealed a clear answer about the effectiveness of remdesivir to treat Covid-19

Remdesivir works by blocking the virus behind Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, from copying its genetic instruction set, or RNA. These instructions are written in a code made of molecules represented by the letters A, U, G, and C. Remdesivir is designed to mimic the molecule represented by A, adenosine.

When the virus’s enzymes make copies of its RNA during an infection, it can take up remdesivir instead of adenosine. When it does, the copying process comes to a grinding halt, and with it, the infection. What makes this especially useful is that remdesivir can fool a virus, but a not a human cell, so it has a targeted effect.

But how well does it work against SARS-CoV-2 in an actual human? That’s where the studies come in.

The NIH trial, called the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial, included 1,063 patients. The results showed that the median time to recover for patients who randomly received the placebo was 15 days, while patients who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days. Remdesivir also lowered the mortality rate compared to the placebo group, from 11.6 percent to 8 percent.

These results, however, are preliminary, and the data behind them haven’t been revealed, let alone published in a peer-reviewed journal.

“It’s difficult to know what to make of that,” said John Norrie, a professor of medical statistics at the University of Edinburgh. “It’s very unusual to say ‘We’ve found some good news but we can’t tell you what it is.’”

Meanwhile, Gilead’s internal study examined 397 patients, dividing them into groups treated with remdesivir for 10 days and groups treated for five days, and found little difference between them. That could be interpreted to mean that remdesivir is just as effective at a lower dose, so the drug can be distributed to more patients. But the study didn’t even include a placebo treatment group, making it harder to gauge the impact of the drug.

The Lancet paper, on the other hand, was based on a true randomized controlled trial from Wuhan, China, with 237 patients. The study was also peer-reviewed by other scientists. Initially, the authors wanted to include up to 450 patients, but the lockdown imposed in the city meant that patients stopped arriving.

Norrie, who wrote a commentary article about the Wuhan study, noted while the study’s design was robust, the findings were inconclusive: There was no statistically significant benefit to taking remdesivir. It may work; it may not.

Eric Topol, director and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told Reuters that this study was one of the stronger pieces of research on remdesivir, and it showed the drug’s impact was lacking.

“That’s the only thing I’ll hang my hat on, and that was negative,” he said. “It was expected to be a whopping effect. It clearly does not have that.”

It’s a frustrating result, but Norrie said the urgent need for a treatment to aid in a pandemic shouldn’t be an excuse for weaker research. However, one way to speed up the process is to pool data from smaller trials around the world into one. “I strongly believe that our best chance of getting to the right decisions quickly is to share data,” Norrie said.

The FDA observed in its announcement, “There is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir to treat people in the hospital with Covid-19.”

Still, doctors have been using it to treat some Covid-19 patients under compassionate-use guidelines. These allow some patients to use experimental drugs if no other options are left.

There are at least 19 studies on remdesivir around the world underway or in planning stages, some recruiting thousands of patients. It will be several months before they yield definitive answers, but they will, hopefully, bring the world closer to a working treatment.

"['Kelsey Piper', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Why some labs work on making viruses deadlier — and why they should stop,"Earlier this week, Newsweek and the Washington Post reported that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a lab near the site of the first coronavirus cases in the world, had been studying bat coronaviruses.

The Newsweek report revealed an alarming tidbit: The Wuhan lab at the center of the controversy had for years been engaged in gain-of-function research. What exactly is it? It’s a line of research where scientists take viruses and study how they might be modified to become deadlier or more transmissible. Why would they do this? Scientists who engage in such research say it helps them figure out which viruses threaten people so they can design countermeasures.

To be clear, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is definitely not a biologically engineered pathogen. It was not released on purpose, and it is likely to have been the result of accidental transmission through human contact with wild animals, like almost all disease outbreaks in history have been.

But the emerging reports about the lab in Wuhan are making many people aware for the first time that gain-of-function research happens at all. I wouldn’t blame you if your response to this news is this: The government gives grants to researchers to make potentially pandemic viruses deadlier and to make them transmissible more easily between people? Why are we doing that?

The increased attention to gain-of-function research is a good thing. This kind of highly controversial research — banned under the Obama administration after safety incidents demonstrated that lab containment is rarely airtight — began again under the Trump administration, and many scientists and public health researchers think it’s a really bad idea. Our brush with the horrors of a pandemic might force us to reconsider the warnings those experts have been sounding for years.

The US stopped funding gain-of-function research. Then it started again.

In 2019, Science magazine broke the news that the US government resumed funding two controversial experiments to make the bird flu more transmissible.

The two experiments had been on hold since 2012 amid a fierce debate in the virology community about gain-of-function research. In 2014, the US government, under the Obama administration, declared a moratorium on such research.

That year was a bad one on the biohazard front. In June 2014, as many as 75 scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were exposed to anthrax. A few weeks later, Food and Drug Administration officials ran across 16 forgotten vials of smallpox in storage. Meanwhile, the “largest, most severe, and most complex” Ebola outbreak in history was raging across West Africa, and the first patient to be diagnosed in the US had just been announced.

It was in that context that scientists and biosecurity experts found themselves embroiled in a debate about gain-of-function research. The scientists who do this kind of research argue that we can better anticipate deadly diseases by making diseases deadlier in the lab. But many people at the time and since have become increasingly convinced that the potential research benefits — which look limited — just don’t outweigh the risks of kicking off the next deadly pandemic ourselves.

While internally divided, the US government came down on the side of caution at the time. It announced a moratorium on funding gain-of-function research — putting potentially dangerous experiments on hold so the world could discuss the risks this research entailed.

But in 2017, the government under the Trump administration released new guidelines for gain-of-function research, signaling an end to the blanket moratorium. And the news from 2019 suggests that dangerous projects are proceeding.

Experts in biosecurity are concerned the field is heading toward a mistake that could kill innocent people. They argue that, to move ahead with research like this, there should be a transparent process with global stakeholders at the table. After all, if anything goes wrong, the mess we’ll face will certainly be a global one.

Should we really be doing this kind of research?

Advocates of this kind of gain-of-function research (not all gain-of-function research uses pathogens that can cause pandemics) point to a few things they hope it will enable us to do.

In general, they argue it will enhance surveillance and monitoring for new potential pandemics. As part of our efforts to thwart pandemics before they start — or before they get severe — we take samples of the viruses currently circulating. If we know what the deadliest and most dangerous strains out there are, the argument goes, then we’ll be able to monitor for them and prepare a response if it looks like such mutations are arising in the wild.

“As coordination of international surveillance activities and global sharing of viruses improve,” some advocates wrote in mBio, we’ll get better at learning which strains are out there. Then, gain-of-function research will tell us which ones are close to becoming deadly.

“GOF data have been used to launch outbreak investigations and allocate resources (e.g., H5N1 in Cambodia), to develop criteria for the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool, and to make difficult and sometimes costly pandemic planning policy decisions,” they argue.

“The United States government weighed the risks and benefits … and developed new oversight mechanisms. We know that it does carry risks. We also believe it is important work to protect human health,” Yoshihiro Kawaoka, an investigator whose gain-of-function research was approved, told Science magazine.

According to this logic, if we’d known for years that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — the virus now keeping us all indoors — was a particularly dangerous one, maybe we could have had disease surveillance systems out to alert us if it made the jump to humans.

Others are skeptical. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, told me last year that he doesn’t think the benefits for vaccine development hold up in most cases. “I haven’t seen any of the vaccine companies say that they need to do this work in order to make vaccines,” he pointed out. “I have not seen evidence that the information people are pursuing could be put into widespread use in the field.”

Furthermore, there are unimaginably many possible variants on a virus, of which researchers can identify only a few. Even if we stumble across one way a virus could mutate to become deadly, we might miss thousands of others. “It’s an open question whether laboratory studies are going to come up with the same solution that nature would,” MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt told me last year. “How predictive are these studies really?” As of right now, that’s still an open question.

And even in the best case, the utility of this work would be sharply limited. “It’s important to keep in mind that many countries do not have mechanisms in place at all — much less a real-time way to identify and reduce or eliminate risks as experiments and new technologies are conceived,” Beth Cameron, the Nuclear Threat Initiative’s vice president for global biological policy and programs, told me.

With the stakes so high, many researchers are frustrated that the US government was not more transparent about which considerations prompted them to fund the research. Is it really necessary to study how to make H5N1, which causes a type of bird flu with an eye-popping mortality rate, more transmissible? Will precautions be in place to make it harder for the virus to escape the lab? What are the expected benefits from the research, and which hazards did the experts who approved the work consider?

“The people proposing the work are highly respected virologists,” Inglesby said. “But laboratory systems are not infallible, and even in the greatest laboratories of the world, there are mistakes.” What measures are in place to prevent that? Will potentially dangerous results be published to the whole world, where unscrupulous actors could follow the instructions?

These are exactly the questions the review process was supposed to answer, but didn’t.

Sometimes pathogens escape from the lab. Here’s how it happens.

The reason the subject of gain-of-function research can inspire such heated opposition is because the stakes can be so high. Pathogens have escaped labs before.

Take smallpox, once one of the deadliest diseases.

In 1977, the last case of smallpox was diagnosed in the wild. The victim was Ali Maow Maalin of Somalia. The World Health Organization tracked down every person he’d been in face-to-face contact with to vaccinate everyone at risk and find anyone who might have caught the virus already. Thankfully, they found no one had. Maalin recovered, and smallpox appeared to be over forever.

That moment came at the end of a decades-long campaign to eradicate smallpox — a deadly infectious disease that killed about 30 percent of those who contracted it — from the face of the Earth. Around 500 million people died of smallpox in the century before it was annihilated.

But in 1978, the disease cropped back up — in Birmingham, England. Janet Parker was a photographer at Birmingham Medical School. When she developed a horrifying rash, doctors initially brushed it off as chicken pox. After all, everyone knew smallpox had been chased out of the world — right?

Parker got worse and was admitted to the hospital, where testing determined she had smallpox after all. She died of it a few weeks later.

How did she get a disease that was supposed to have been eradicated?

It turned out that the building Parker worked in also contained a research laboratory, one of a handful where smallpox was studied by scientists who were trying to contribute to the eradication effort. Some papers reported the lab was badly mismanaged, with important precautions ignored because of haste. (The doctor who ran the lab died by suicide shortly after Parker was diagnosed.) Somehow, smallpox escaped the lab to infect an employee elsewhere in the building. Through sheer luck and a rapid response from health authorities, including a quarantine of more than 300 people, the deadly error didn’t turn into an outright pandemic.

In 2014, as the Food and Drug Administration did cleanup for a planned move to a new office, hundreds of unclaimed vials of virus samples were found in a cardboard box in the corner of a cold storage room. Six of them, it turned out, were vials of smallpox. No one had been keeping track of them; no one knew they were there. They may have been there since the 1960s.

Panicked scientists put the materials in a box, sealed it with clear packaging tape, and carried it to a supervisor’s office. (This is not approved handling of dangerous biological materials.) It was later found that the integrity of one vial was compromised — luckily, not one containing a deadly virus.

The 1979 and 2014 incidents grabbed attention because they involved smallpox, but incidents of unintended exposure to controlled biological agents are actually quite common. Hundreds of incidents occur every year, though not all involve potentially pandemic-causing pathogens.

In 2014, a researcher accidentally contaminated a vial of a fairly harmless bird flu with a far-deadlier strain. The deadlier bird flu was then shipped across the country to a lab that didn’t have authorization to handle such a dangerous virus, where it was used for research on chickens.

The mistake was discovered only when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted an extensive investigation in the aftermath of a different mistake — the potential exposure of 75 federal employees to live anthrax, after a lab that was supposed to inactivate the anthrax samples accidentally prepared activated ones.

The CDC’s Select Agents and Toxins program requires “theft, loss, release causing an occupational exposure, or release outside of primary biocontainment barriers” of agents on its watchlist be immediately reported. Between 2005 and 2012, the agency got 1,059 release reports — an average of one incident every few days. Here are a few examples:

In 2008, a sterilization device malfunctioned and unexpectedly opened, exposing a nearby unvaccinated worker to undisclosed pathogens.

In 2009, a new high-security bioresearch facility — rated to handle Ebola, smallpox, and other dangerous pathogens — had its decontamination showers fail. The pressurized chamber kept losing pressure and the door back into the lab kept bursting open while the scientists leaned against it to try to keep it closed. Building engineers were eventually called to handle the chemical showers manually.

In 2011, a worker at a lab that studied dangerous strains of bird flu found herself unable to shower after a construction contractor accidentally shut off the water. She removed her protective equipment and left without taking a decontaminating shower. (She was escorted to another building and showered there, but pathogens could have been released in the meantime.)

Now, the vast majority of these mistakes never infect anyone. And while 1,059 is an eye-popping number of accidents, it actually reflects a fairly low rate of accidents — working in a controlled biological agents lab is safe compared to many occupations, like trucking or fishing.

But a trucking or fishing accident will, at worst, kill a few dozen people, while a pandemic pathogen accident could potentially kill a few million. Considering the stakes and worst-case scenarios involved, it’s hard to look at those numbers and conclude that our precautions against disaster are sufficient.

Reviewing the incidents, it looks like there are many different points of failure — machinery that’s part of the containment process malfunctions; regulations aren’t sufficient or aren’t followed. Human error means live viruses are handled instead of dead ones.

Now imagine such an error involving viruses enhanced through gain-of-function research. “If an enhanced novel strain of flu escaped from a laboratory and then went on to cause a pandemic, then causing millions of deaths is a serious risk,” Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, told me last year.

The cost-benefit analysis for pathogens that might kill the people exposed or a handful of others is vastly different from the cost-benefit analysis for pathogens that could cause a pandemic — but our current procedures don’t really account for that. As a result, allowing gain-of-function research means running unacceptable risks with millions of lives. It’s high time to rethink that.

"['Madeline Marshall', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,How voting by mail could save the US election,"On April 7, 2020, as the coronavirus held much of the US under lockdown, Wisconsin held an election. Many other states had already decided to delay their spring elections to protect voters.

But in Wisconsin, voters were forced to choose between participating in the election and protecting their safety. Wisconsin’s decision sparked outrage, but it also highlighted a question the US really needs to figure out soon: How do you hold an election during a pandemic?

The answer: voting by mail. Tens of millions of Americans are already voting by mail. Every state allows it.

And ask any election official (Republican or Democrat): The risk of voter fraud is extremely low. In some cases, it can be even more secure than voting in person.

Watch the video above to learn more about how voting by mail works and how it’s kept secure. Or read more from Vox’s David Roberts.

"['Joss Fong', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,How to read that coronavirus chart,"Much of the data about the coronavirus pandemic is flawed. Collected and reported in different ways by different countries, it almost certainly undercounts the number of cases and deaths from this disease.

But organizations and journalists still need to report the available data to inform the public and help guide policymakers. Much of that data ends up in visualizations, like charts and maps, which can make it easier to understand and analyze. But it’s important to know how the process of data visualization can shape our perception of the crisis.

In this video, we deconstruct one particularly popular chart of Covid-19 cases, first published by the Grattan Institute and the Financial Times, and explain how to avoid being misled by it.

"['Laura Bult Danush Parvaneh Estelle Caswell', 'Laura Bult', 'Danush Parvaneh', 'Estelle Caswell', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Why you should wear a face mask to fight the coronavirus,"In the first crucial weeks of the coronavirus spreading in the United States, Americans were instructed to wear a face mask only if they were sick. In the absence of widespread testing, that most likely meant you’d wear a face mask if you felt the symptoms of Covid-19.

But based on what we’ve learned since then about this novel coronavirus, being symptomatic shouldn’t be the sole indicator that a person is infected. Roughly 25 percent of people with coronavirus are thought to be asymptomatic, and people who catch Covid-19 usually don’t develop symptoms until four or five days after being infected. This is one of the ways Covid-19 has been able to spread within communities, often without us knowing.

That’s why face masks are important for both sick and presumably healthy people, say public health experts Shan Soe-Lin and Robert Hecht. In early April, the US Centers for Disease control reversed their recommendations on face mask use and now advise that Americans should wear homemade cloth masks regardless of whether they are sick or symptomatic.

The inconsistency in recommendations led to a lot of confusion about whether face masks work. They do work, but they shouldn’t be thought of as a panacea in the fight against Covid-19, Soe-Lin and Hecht said. Instead, they should be employed along with social distancing and hand-washing as a three-pronged effort to stay healthy.

"['Li Zhou', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Kamala Harris’s new bill would set up a task force to address racial disparities in coronavirus response,"A new bill from Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), the Covid-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act, would set up a task force to address the racial disparities that have emerged in coronavirus cases and deaths.

In recent months, data tracking the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted an alarming pattern when it comes to who’s affected: According to state-level numbers, people of color are disproportionately dying from the virus.

This pattern, the result of inequities in health care access and systemic discrimination within the health care system, has been evident in early demographic data that’s been released by various places across the country. In Louisiana, black people make up 57 percent of confirmed coronavirus deaths, and 33 percent of the state’s overall population. In Michigan, black people make up 40 percent of coronavirus fatalities, and 13.6 percent of the state’s overall population.

There’s been a serious lag in the disclosure of such breakdowns across the board. According to a tracker by Johns Hopkins University, 41 states are currently releasing data on race and the number of cases they’ve detected. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released preliminary federal data, though the agency noted that it was incomplete.

Harris’s bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a team of health care policy experts, regional leaders, and federal officials that would use demographic data about who’s affected by the coronavirus pandemic to develop funding and policy prescriptions for FEMA and other agencies. The bill wouldn’t just stop at data collection; the idea is to use the information to better inform the response to the pandemic.

“The COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act is a necessary step to fully understand the impact of this virus in the hardest hit communities, and make targeted investments that correspond with their unique needs,” Harris said in a statement.

The bill faces a tough road to becoming law; Senate Republicans have been hostile to most Democratic ideas on tackling the coronavirus crisis aside from rescue for small businesses, and Harris’s bill is unlikely to attract the necessary support from across the aisle. However, some other prominent Democrats, including Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), are cosponsoring the legislation.

What Harris’s bill would do

Harris’s bill would bring together representatives from different groups that are involved with combating the pandemic, and set up a task force focused on identifying places where there are racial and ethnic disparities in the number of people being tested, diagnosed, and hospitalized for coronavirus. The group would then use this information to provide weekly recommendations to FEMA for disaster aid and the allocation of supplies such as personal protective equipment, testing kits, and ventilators.

“We need to convene health care and policy experts with local leaders in order to allocate the necessary resources to meet everyone’s needs — especially in communities that have historically suffered from unfair and insufficient response from the government during times of crisis,” says Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, in a statement about the bill. Task forces have already been established in multiple places including New York City and Boston, in an effort to combat the disproportionate impacts coronavirus has had on residents of color.

The most recent stimulus bill that Congress passed, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, requires the HHS Secretary to provide Congress with a report on the demographics of people who have been tested and diagnosed with coronavirus, within 21 days of the legislation’s enactment. A bill from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Equitable Data and Disclosure Act, would also require HHS to post daily data updates on coronavirus cases, broken out by race, ethnicity, and other demographic traits.

Harris’s legislation adds to these efforts in an attempt to set up a team that would direct agency funds to combat such inequities, once more comprehensive data sets are available. The bill would also establish a permanent Infectious Disease Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force when the pandemic ends, in order to continue monitoring inequities within the health care system.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Pressure mounts on Trump to “drop the hammer” on China,"As President Donald Trump weighs ideas for punishing China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, some inside and outside the White House want him to respond forcefully.

“In my personal opinion, we should drop the fucking hammer on them. Stop being such pussies,” a senior White House official told me, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to disclose internal deliberations.

Top Trump allies, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Republican senators, are pushing Trump to castigate China. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for example, has said the US should “make China pay big time.”

The Washington Post reported Thursday that US officials from multiple agencies were planning to gather that day to discuss crafting some sort of retaliation against China.

“President Trump has fumed to aides and others in recent days about China, blaming the country for withholding information about the virus,” the Post reported.

The Chinese government delayed releasing information about the outbreak of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan, costing world governments precious time to prepare. It’s ruthlessly exploiting the pandemic to further its own foreign policy goals. And on Friday, Sky News reported that the Chinese government is refusing to allow investigators with the World Health Organization to participate in China’s inquiries into the virus’s origin.

These actions — as well as Trump’s likely desire to deflect some of the blame from his own administration’s poor response to the coronavirus crisis in the US — are why the Trump administration is looking to formally rebuke China in some way.

Here’s what’s in the works.

From stripping sovereign immunity to canceling debt

The ideas reportedly under consideration include stripping China of its “sovereign immunity” status under US law — which would allow the US government or private citizens to sue the country — and cancelling some or all of the interest payments on the more than $1 trillion in debt the US owes to China (the senior White House official I spoke to said they favor the latter option).

“Punishing China is definitely where the president’s head is at right now,” one senior adviser told the Washington Post on Thursday.

Yet Trump, in public at least, has sounded far more cautious about using these measures. “You start playing those games and that’s tough,” Trump said at a press conference on Thursday when asked about the idea of canceling interest payments to China, adding that doing so could undermine the “sanctity of the [US] dollar.”

This echoes comments made the same day by Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow, who called reports the administration was considering canceling debt payments “absolutely and unequivocally untrue,” adding that “the full faith and credit of US debt obligations is sacrosanct.”

This is why the senior White House official I spoke to said they’re “very doubtful senior advisers will allow” the debt-payment idea to go forward, acknowledging that Congress would likely try to block such a move anyway.

But some Trump advisers and allies are still pushing the president to retaliate against China in some way.

At the same Thursday press conference, Trump suggested another idea: imposing billions of dollars in additional tariffs on China.

Why tariffs wouldn’t punish China

To punish China, the US “can do it with tariffs,” Trump said Thursday.

Yet there’s (at least) one big, glaring problem with this idea: Though Trump has long believed that China pays these tariffs and the money goes to the US Treasury, that is not at all how tariffs actually work.

Tariffs raise the price of buying Chinese goods for American consumers. The idea is that by making Chinese products more expensive, American consumers will stop buying them from China and buy them more cheaply from somewhere else instead. While that would ultimately harm Chinese producers in the long run, in the short run, it’s American consumers who are stuck paying these tariffs, not China.

With US unemployment claims having reached a staggering 30 million and the country facing an economic downturn unseen since the Great Depression, making things more expensive for American consumers would be less a punishment on China and more a self-own.

On top of that, the US has already placed tariffs on nearly every major Chinese product, so it’s not even clear that the eventual impact on Chinese manufacturers would be all that meaningful.

Still, it seems some kind of retaliation is coming. Asked Friday about the administration’s China considerations, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said she wouldn’t get ahead of the president on any announcements, but she reiterated Trump’s “displeasure with China,” adding, “It’s no secret that China mishandled this situation.”

“The China approach is all over the place”

Some sort of grander planning has already begun.

Multiple sources at the State Department told me that Pompeo has almost every office doing some sort of work involving China. Whether in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, or elsewhere, Pompeo has staff looking at ways to counter China’s aims, such as having US allies end certain business contracts with Beijing.

However, some in the State Department believe there’s no real strategy to the top-down directive. The entire idea is “shortsighted,” said one staffer tasked with finding ways to push back on China, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. “The China approach is all over the place.”

Another State Department staffer pushed back against the notion that the department is in search of a more-robust-than-normal stance against China. “It is our standard policy to counter Chinese influence,” they told me.

What’s clear, though, is that the administration is thinking of ways to up the ante against China. When, and what, Trump decides to do is what everyone’s waiting on.

"['Katherine Harmon Courage', 'May']",2020-05-01,Coronavirus’s new mystery: It’s causing strokes in healthy people,"As more people around the world are infected with Covid-19, we’re learning that the novel coronavirus can not only cause severe respiratory illness, but also can attack just about every major organ system in the body. And lately doctors have been sounding the alarm about a disturbing new outcome: blood clots and strokes, which are striking even healthy young people with no known risk factors — and sometimes no other symptom of the virus.

An April 28 report in the New England Journal of Medicine details the cases of five people, ages 33 to 49, in New York City who had strokes and subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. All of them had large-vessel strokes outside of the hospital before experiencing other severe symptoms of the virus; one of them has since died.

“It was very surprising to see the increase in this large-vessel stroke in young people,” Thomas Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai in New York and a coauthor of the new report, tells Vox. As he explains, “The bigger the vessel, the bigger the stroke.”

“It’s the biggest story emerging” about Covid-19, he adds. The rate of large-vessel stroke victims under 50 they saw was seven times higher than before the pandemic.

Blood clots are also causing other unexpected problems for Covid-19 patients. For example, Broadway actor Nick Cordero, who has been hospitalized since March with severe Covid-19, had his right leg amputated earlier this month after doctors were unable to control clotting there.

And many patients are developing small clots in their lungs, reducing the amount of oxygen they can move into their bodies. For others, their blood is clogging dialysis machines (which has been a problem due to the amount of kidney failure this illness is also causing).

“I’m a hematologist, and this is unprecedented,” says Jeffrey Laurence of Weill Cornell Medical College, who has been in the field for three decades. “This is not like a disease we’ve seen before.”

Nearly every patient he has seen for blood disorders in the past month and a half has had Covid-19. “I’ve never had so many consults in my life. These people are clotting, and we can’t shut it off.”

Doctors and researchers are racing to figure out why this is happening, and how they might be able to best use existing therapies, such as blood thinners, to mitigate it in patients. The clots and strokes also add to the list of potential symptoms some people with Covid-19 might experience early on — and gives another possible reason that the number of coronavirus-related deaths around the country is looking far larger than those officially being counted in hospitals.

What causes blood to clot?

When we get injured, we depend on our blood’s ability to clot to stop the flow of blood. Clotting is a complex process that involves small cell fragments called platelets congregating and changing shape, proteins that help even more cells bind together, and the secretion of substances called blood clotting factors. If any of these processes go off course, people can experience excessive bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

“I’ve never had so many consults in my life. These people are clotting, and we can’t shut it off”

On the other end of the spectrum, sometimes clots form inside blood vessels (more rarely, in arteries) without an injury. These can cause serious harm and sometimes death. There are many risk factors for developing internal blood clots, including smoking, obesity, heart disease, and others. And, now, it looks like Covid-19 is a risk factor as well.

Some clots remain in the place where they form and are known as thrombosis. This can cause severe pain and swelling. These clots can also travel to — or form in — a major organ, where they can do even more serious damage.

For example, a clot in the leg can travel up to the lungs, cutting off blood flow and causing a pulmonary embolism (which can lead to death or permanent lung damage). A clot can also flow to the heart, triggering a heart attack. And one in or near the head can block blood flow in part of the brain, bringing on a stroke.

What clots are doing to Covid-19 patients

Small early studies and case reports about the link between the novel coronavirus and blood clots are now pouring in. For example, one team in the Netherlands followed 184 severe Covid-19 patients who were receiving treatment in three different intensive care units. They found that 31 percent of these people had some sort of blood clotting issue, a percentage they call “remarkably high.”

Other data is emerging with similar implications. “In patients with severe disease, various forms of blood clots are estimated to occur in 15-35 percent of patients,” Behnood Bikdeli, a cardiology fellow at Columbia University Medical Center, tells Vox. And these clots, especially the small ones, “could impact the illness severity and involvement of many of the organs,” he says. (He and an international team of dozens of researchers published an April review of clotting issues in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.)

Laurence has been studying small blood clots in HIV/AIDS patients for decades. In March, a dermatologist sent him a photo of surprising skin lesions on a young man who was severely ill with Covid-19. Laurence was stunned. “It’s a picture of microvascular clotting, where you can see exactly where the vessels have clotted,” he says. He started wondering if something similar might be happening in the lungs.

Just hours later, another doctor called, giving him access to an autopsy of a different Covid-19 patient. Not only did this individual have small clots in the skin — but also in his lungs. (Laurence and his colleagues published descriptions of these and three other cases of severe clotting in an April Translational Research paper.)

The presence of small clots in the lungs is disturbing, but it also might help to explain a puzzling trend medical staff have noticed in some Covid-19 patients. When people develop more advanced illness, their lungs can become stiff, making breathing on their own very difficult. This leads to a drop in blood oxygen if they are not on mechanical ventilation.

But health care workers have seen many patients with low oxygen levels but who still have fairly flexible lungs, Laurence explains. This points to the presence of “microvessel clots [in the lungs] shutting off the ability of people to bring oxygen into their blood,” he says. (He also noted that sustained time on a ventilator can, itself, increase lung stiffness, which could have been throwing off clinicians who were seeing that as an outcome of the illness, and perhaps along the way missing signs that something else was going on.)

Laurence also describes the multitude of people sick with Covid-19 whose blood clots are plugging up the dialysis machines in their wards. Beyond that, he says, even “as the nurses are drawing their blood, it’s clotting in the tubes, and they’re on full doses of Heparin” and other blood-thinning medications. “Everyone is seeing a similar kind of thing,” he says.

These observations also bear out in autopsies.

A team of Chinese researchers that looked at 183 people hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China, found evidence of clotting in 71 percent of those who died — but less than 1 percent of those who didn’t. (Notably, this paper was published early in the pandemic, in February.)

The prevalence of blood clots also raises the question of whether some stroke or heart attack home deaths in recent months were actually linked to Covid-19. It’s yet another possible way Covid-19 fatalities might be being undercounted. Many people who have already died are not currently tested for Covid-19 (often in the interest of preserving tests for those who are still alive). But more widespread posthumous testing could help clarify the full impact of this disease.

How Covid-19 might be causing blood clots

Scientists still don’t understand exactly what is triggering this excessive blood clotting. (Some viruses, such as the Ebola virus, cause extreme bleeding, but others, such as HIV, can trigger small clots.) And it’s not yet clear if these changes in the blood are from the virus itself or the body’s immune response to the infection.

One of the hypotheses has to do with how the virus gains entry to our cells. Researchers have found that this coronavirus manages to sneak into our cells via a specific type of receptor known as ACE2. These are prominently found in the lungs, which might explain why so much of the virus’s damage has been centered there. But ACE2 receptors are also very common along the walls of blood vessels throughout the body, Oxley explains. So it’s possible that its presence there is spurring additional inflammation of the vessels, prompting the formation of blood clots.

Laurence also points to this inflammatory problem. “It is this insidious feedback loop of inflammation,” he says. And once it’s going, he says, “you can’t intervene in that system effectively.”

To be sure, sustained immobility, such as in a hospital bed, can increase the risk for blood clots, but the rates currently being reported in Covid-19 patients is way above what would normally be expected, Laurence notes.

What can be done

With the new evidence about this virus’s potential effect on the blood, doctors at many major medical facilities have begun administering low doses of preventative blood thinners to Covid-19 patients.

It’s a tricky move, though, because too much blood thinner can cause a patient to bleed internally and possibly die. To gauge the best doses, many physicians are going off of a patient’s D-dimer levels, which is a biomarker for the presence of blood clots. New clinical trials have quickly spun up (including a multi-state one in the US to test one type of powerful blood thinners, known as tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) in Covid-19 patients, as STAT News reports). And Bikdeli and others have formed an international collective “to provide interim consensus-based guidance,” he says. “What is needed most is high-quality data.”

But these preventive treatments won’t help those who’ve had strokes or other major blood-clot complications before receiving medical care. And that number, though still small, is real, as the five young stroke victims from New York City show.

“It is this insidious feedback loop of inflammation ... you can’t intervene in that system effectively”

The New England Journal of Medicine report included all stroke patients under 50 at the Mount Sinai health system in New York City during a two-week period in late March and early April. That this rate was nearly seven times the number of stroke patients in that age group during any average two-week period over the previous year indicates a very strong correlation between Covid-19 — even mild and asymptomatic cases — and the potential for major blood-clotting.

“These patients were at home with mild or no symptoms who suddenly developed signs of stroke,” Oxley says.

Some of these young patients had also been reluctant to seek medical attention — even after fairly severe stroke symptoms. And it wasn’t unreasonable for them not to be on the lookout for such a major neurological issue. “These are people among the least likely statistically to have a stroke,” J Mocco, a Mount Sinai neurosurgeon and coauthor of the report, told the Washington Post.

For example, the youngest, a 33-year-old woman, developed slurred speech and felt weak and numb on her left side for 28 hours before seeking help. She (as well as one other stroke patient in the study) was “concerned about going to a hospital during the pandemic,” the authors noted — even though she had had a cough, headache, and chills for a week.

She is one of the lucky ones. She is the only one who has been able to start speaking again. After 10 days in the hospital to treat her blood clotting, she was discharged to a rehabilitation center.

There is also a question of how long the danger of Covid-19-related clotting lasts. Laurence notes that “a lot of our cases, they went through their cough and fever, then all of a sudden, there’s a stroke or a blood clot in their legs.” For other patients, after having recovered from their primary Covid-19 symptoms, “their difficulty of breathing came back, signaling that they have a pulmonary embolism in their lungs,” he says. “So people have to be vigilant to look for possible signs” — even after they feel like they have passed the worst of their illness.

Additionally, “people at high risk for thrombotic events need to be vigilant, keep good hydration, and keep being active, especially during the period of social distancing and lockdown,” Bikdeli says. This group includes people with a family history of blood clots or strokes, obesity, some cancer treatments and surgeries, pregnancy, some birth control methods, and others.

But major strokes can be treatable, Oxley notes. It’s just a question of timing. For best results treatment must begin within six hours of stroke. As he told the Washington Post, “the message we are trying to get out is if you have symptoms of stroke, you need to call the ambulance.”

"['Aja Romano', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Coronavirus memes: These AI-generated memes are better than ones created by humans,"It’s official: The coronavirus quarantine may have well and truly made the concept of a “meme” obsolete. For proof, look no further than “This Meme Does Not Exist,” a meme-creation tool created by meme-template website Imgflip.

At a glance, it looks like your average random assortment of meme templates. But these memes aren’t actually “real.” They’re being created on the spot by a neural network, an artificial intelligence (AI) that predicts what it thinks a meme might look like. You can let the network generate a random meme for you, or you can preselect your meme from one of many popular templates, from Mocking SpongeBob to the Gatsby toast.

The tool is not to be confused with other meme generators, which merely curate existing popular memes. No, this generator uses its data about memes that do exist to conjure up memes that don’t exist. If you’re not familiar with a neural network, it’s basically a computer that uses an algorithmic technique known as deep learning. The computer gorges itself on a lot of data and then teaches itself, through lots of repetition, how to predict what that data should look like. Neural networks have made great strides in recent years, giving us everything from fake movies to fake articles and, of course, fake porn.

Basically, Imgflip’s neural network processed a lot of memes and then tried to predict what memes should look like. The results are often hilarious, and they certainly feel like real memes. For instance, here’s the first thing the AI generated when I asked it to show me an example of the “Is This a Pigeon?” meme:

Not bad, right? They get better. Some of the other memes being generated seem eerily appropriate for the current moment we’re in:

And take this iteration of the Distracted Boyfriend meme. It’s honestly hard for me to believe that a computer artificially generated this, not a frustrated kid stuck at home with their well-meaning but stifling mother for much longer than nature would normally allow:

In fact, some of the memes — which identify themselves as AI-generated with a tiny watermark at the bottom, in case you get confused — are jaw-droppingly on point:

Other memes, however, wildly miss the mark and make little to no sense. But hilariously, that also makes them feel memetic — because after all, many memes draw upon their nigh-nonsensical Dadaist leanings to gain new meaning from their new contexts. So a meme like this one, generated by the neural network, still seems like a real meme:

It’s hardly surprising, then, that between the novelty of a fake-meme generator, its eerie ability to capture our moods, and our current collective boredom, the meme generator itself has gone viral. Over the last week, posts collecting some of the funniest AI-generated memes have made the rounds on social media:

I typed ""communism"" into that AI meme generator (https://t.co/DDvREGUKjd) and got these. Enjoy pic.twitter.com/lBcNHFkwhI — ur fav is a communist (@urfavsacommie) April 30, 2020

The AI generator’s new fans have frequently emphasized the way in which the tool aligns with our persistent feelings of isolation during quarantine, while simultaneously helping us alleviate our anxiety with a lot of humor.

Off-topic but if you haven't discovered the AI meme generator, it's brought me quire a lot of joy in these dark times. https://t.co/tqV3te3h64 pic.twitter.com/ZwRwDVrHDf — Am I the Asshole? (@AITA_reddit) April 29, 2020

But a big part of the appeal is the aforementioned hilarious randomness whenever the AI skews slightly off-kilter from a “normal” meme.

I feel like I'm constantly waiting for truth to come back from the toilet but I've never known how to describe this feeling until now. thank you — Yannick LeJacq (@YannickLeJacq) April 29, 2020

As with all other attempts to virtually approximate reality, the result of this AI is often an uncanny valley between a real meme and a fake one. But the “truth” is probably somewhere in between — or somewhere on a toilet — and that’s also meaningful in terms of telling us what a “meme” even is.

When most of us have abruptly transferred most of our activities online, our shared thoughts, frustrations, and internet tools we use to connect to one another can also become memetic. So memes in the time of quarantine, to me at least, feel much more nebulous, fluid, and tougher to single out than memes of yore.

Maybe this is because social media spreads ideas, themes, and moods nearly instantaneously. When we’re all using social media to stay connected — for instance, Twitter usage is currently at an all-time high — things can feel memetic before they’ve had time to take shape in a traditional meme format. Even if, for instance, a quarantine joke or a Covid-19 catchphrase doesn’t get passed around in a single repeat iteration with variants — as does a traditional meme — it can still become a memetic part of the zeitgeist. After weeks and weeks of coronavirus memes and quarantine memes, everything has sort of started to feel like a meme.

In an environment where everything is kind of already a meme, we could be primed for a fake meme that uses the framework of memes themselves to bend reality a little.

Of course, there are still some glitches in this new virtual matrix. When you visit the site, it currently informs you that the prefix text feature, which allows users to generate memes using keywords of their choice, is “temporarily disabled due to high volume. Neural networks are extremely expensive to run.” I guess not even an AI can bend reality that far.

"['Sigal Samuel', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,The moral cost of America’s meat-supply obsession,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week declaring meat processing plants “critical infrastructure” that should stay open wherever possible. Invoking the Defense Production Act, Trump said that plant closures “threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain.”

Yet keeping the plants open threatens workers’ lives. Facilities across the US have become hot spots for Covid-19 outbreaks: More than 3,000 workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and at least 17 have died.

Some plants have been forced to close due to high rates of infection. At a Tyson plant in Waterloo, Iowa, more than 180 employees got sick. At a Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, it was more than 640 workers.

But the leaders of these giant companies aren’t happy about shuttering plants, and they’re pushing back. Tyson’s chairman took out full-page ads in the New York Times and the Washington Post, claiming that “the food supply chain is breaking.” And Smithfield’s CEO said plant closures are “pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply.”

To evaluate these claims and discuss what America’s obsession with the meat supply might be missing, I called up Leah Garcés, the president of Mercy for Animals. She suggested that while we’re all focused on the possibility of a meat shortage, what we should really reflect upon during this crisis is our profoundly immoral food system.

Like many supply-chain experts, Garcés said we probably won’t see severe nationwide meat shortages anytime soon (though there may be spot shortages of certain meats in some grocery stores). But what we will see, in the processing plants that stay open, is thousands more workers getting sick. And in areas where plants close, we will see millions of animals being euthanized by farmers who have nowhere to send them for slaughter. That means these animals will die for nothing — the meat will never make it to our plates.

I talked to Garcés about the moral dimensions of the crisis we’re facing, whether the pandemic will prompt us to hit the “reset” button on our food system, and how meat companies can stop driving the problem and start driving the solution. A transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Sigal Samuel

What do you think of Trump’s executive order declaring meat plants “critical infrastructure” that should stay open?

Leah Garcés

This is not an appropriate use of the Defense Production Act. Slaughter plants are not critical infrastructure, and they are certainly not worth the price that will most certainly be paid: further death and illness.

This is a slap in the face to workers and protects the industry from being held accountable for the deaths and illnesses it is causing. Our government should be focused on protecting workers’ health and creating systemic solutions to overhaul our outdated, unsafe, and inhumane food system, not providing protections for Big Ag.

Sigal Samuel

Trump’s order came after the leaders of some of America’s biggest meat companies issued dire warnings — like Tyson’s claim that “the food supply chain is breaking” and Smithfield’s claim that plant closures are “pushing our country perilously close to the edge in terms of our meat supply.” Are those claims true?

Leah Garcés

Our meat supply is not “perilously close to the edge.” These claims are simply meant to stoke fear. US meat producers are still exporting meat, and the industry still has a surplus of meat in frozen storage. The National Chicken Council even said, as they were asking for relief funds [from the government], they have “historically high cold storage supply levels.”

And so I don’t have that concern about shortages direct to grocery stores or to consumers. In terms of our supply, I doubt there’s going to be that issue. But I think the industry will suffer because people are eating out less.

Sigal Samuel

It sounds like what we’ve got is not so much a meat-supply problem — it’s more a problem of getting the meat processed. Can you help me understand why our system for getting meat is so fragile?

Leah Garcés

When [animal behavior expert] Temple Grandin talks about factory farming, she says, “Big is fragile.” It’s a machine that relies on everything working perfectly. Like in the slaughterhouses, all of the chickens have to come to the exact same size so that they fit in their shackles perfectly. If there’s a tiny sliver of a problem, there’s a ripple effect through the whole system. And that means farmers might not get paid, animals might be treated inhumanely, and consumers might not get the product that they were hoping for.

Sigal Samuel

Okay, so right now, it’s in the slaughterhouses where things are breaking down, right?

Leah Garcés

Yes. Covid-19 is very infectious, and if you stand shoulder to shoulder with people, you’re [potentially] going to get it. Well, where are we continuing to stand shoulder to shoulder? In slaughterhouses.

Sigal Samuel

What is it about the way that slaughterhouses are set up that makes it almost impossible for workers to socially distance from one another?

Let me describe what it looks like in a chicken slaughterhouse. The chickens arrive from the back of a warehouse in these crates, and then they’re moved onto a conveyor belt. And then workers who stand shoulder to shoulder are rapidly grabbing them by the legs and putting them on shackles that are moving extremely fast — the birds are hung upside down. And then they move rapidly away from the workers and they go through the process of being killed.

From the workers’ perspective, each has a very specific job. One of them has to make this cut and the other one has to make that cut. Another one has to pull this part of the body off. One of them has to put it into a package. And they have to do all that very, very fast. You can’t step away to go to the bathroom, for example, because then your job in the machine is left unattended. [Even before the pandemic] there were reports that women were not getting bathroom breaks and were wearing diapers.

Now that we’re impacted by Covid-19, workers are getting sick in droves because they’re continuing to stand shoulder to shoulder. It’s really questionable whether this is the right thing to be doing as a nation. Should we be putting these workers at risk just to deliver us cheap chicken?

Sigal Samuel

Recent reports say that coronavirus infections have spread through at least 48 meatpacking plants in the US, and 3,000 workers have gotten sick and at least 17 have died.

Leah Garcés

And I bet the numbers are much higher than that, because as we know, there’s underreporting happening. People are being infected and they’re also bringing it home to family members who might be vulnerable, might be older.

In South Dakota, 40 percent of all infections in the state have been linked to a Smithfield pork slaughterhouse. I mean, these are really serious concerns for how we’re going to control this pandemic.

Sigal Samuel

When slaughterhouses close, what happens to all of the animals that were supposed to be slaughtered? Does it cause a choke point where animals on farms are just going to get killed because consumers aren’t going out to eat those products?

Leah Garcés

In a single slaughterhouse, a million chickens are killed a week on average. Now, if even just one of those plants is at 50 percent capacity, it means that 500,000 birds that were supposed to be slaughtered are not going to be slaughtered now.

So what’s happening to them? Well, the answer is that they’re being killed through emergency methods on farms. We know that because one poultry company reported that they were doing that. They said they’re just going to kill them on the farm en masse.

Sigal Samuel

Wait, how do they do that?

Leah Garcés

They referred to these approved methods by the American Veterinary Medical Association. And those methods are through filling the barn with a layer of water-based foam that suffocates the birds.

People might think, “Well, if they go to the slaughterhouse, they’re going to die anyway. Who cares?” But it’s a big difference in terms of the amount they suffer at their death. And it’s also crazy wasteful — the fact that all these animals went through a factory-farmed, horrible life, only to be foamed to death and then disposed of.

Sigal Samuel

I think it’s easier for us to justify slaughtering animals when we know people are going to eat them and that it will sustain [them] — there’s some use being gotten out of it, at least. But if we’re raising these animals and then just killing millions of them and not using them, that becomes a lot more morally difficult.

Given all of this, do you think this pandemic is going to change how people think about eating meat in general?

Leah Garcés

I really hope so. I think it’s one of the best shots we have at getting people to think about how the system needs to be changed. It’s a very rare opportunity to hit “reset” on the food system.

What it’s shown us is that when we only rely on our protein coming from animals and a system that is so fragile, it leaves companies and consumers very vulnerable. While the majority of our protein today comes from animals, it would be far more efficient and sustainable for that to come from plants. And we know that that’s not a crazy idea, because several of the largest meat companies have already begun offering plant-based products, like Tyson and Perdue and Cargill.

Sigal Samuel

It’s interesting how all these big traditional meat companies are getting into the plant-based meat game. Plus, the plant-based meat companies themselves seem to be doing very well in this moment. Impossible Foods just announced they’re expanding sales of their products to another 750 stores across the US so people will be able to get their Impossible Burgers. It sounds like that’s part of the shift you’re advocating for.

Leah Garcés

Absolutely. I mean, demand for meat just grows at about 2 percent or so each year. But sales in plant-based foods have jumped 11 percent over the past year. And so that is something companies that are concerned about their bottom line should be very interested in. If they’re smart, they’ll pivot and diversify and instead of being disrupted, they’ll be part of the disruption.

Sigal Samuel

Realistically, though, when I look at the US, I see a country where eating meat is super-entwined with national identity, and people eat, on average, more than 200 pounds of meat a year. So when this pandemic ends, are people actually going to hit “reset”? Or is it more likely that we’ll just go right back to business as usual?

Leah Garcés

I think the pandemic is a tipping point. Like I said, companies were already investing in plant-based products and blending them into their portfolio, and that was without a pandemic. Now they’re seeing their entire supply chain disrupted. They’re unable to answer media calls about where animals are being killed and what is happening to workers. So I think the companies are going to be coming out of this saying, “There’s another option here, and we should be investing more in that.”

Sigal Samuel

I guess if we can enter a world where companies see it as in their bottom-line interest to make this transition, in addition to being in the interest of animals and human laborers, then there might actually be a shot of this happening.

Leah Garcés

I always think when we’re trying to solve really big, hard social justice issues, we have to look for the win-wins. This is a win-win for consumers, for animals, for workers, and for the companies.

It’s a mistake to just think about these companies as these monolithic beasts that are doing evil in the world. I mean, they’re made up of individuals who want to do good, too. We can appeal to that sense, that they’re just trying to feed people protein.

I know this from experience, because I know Jim Perdue — the head of Perdue, which is the sixth-largest poultry company in the country. He said to me at one point: “Our mission is to be a premium protein company. And nothing about that says that it has to come from chickens.” Lo and behold, six months after saying that, [Perdue] came out with a plant-based blended product, because he said, “What the consumers want, we will follow.”

So I am certain that this can be a win-win for everybody, including these big companies. And they don’t have to be these monolithic beasts, these enemies to us. They can be part of solving this problem.

"['David Roberts', 'May']",2020-04-20,Coronavirus stimulus money will be wasted on fossil fuels,"As countries across the world have gone into lockdown in response to Covid-19, economies are in free fall. Almost every sector is taking a hit, hemorrhaging jobs and value. And almost every sector will be shaped, for years to come, by the speed, amount, and nature of public assistance it receives. There is a finite amount of time, resources, and political will available to get economies going again; not every sector will get what it wants or needs.

In short, the decisions legislators make in response to the coronavirus crisis will have an enormous influence on what kind of economies emerge on the other side.

A few weeks ago, I wrote about what an ideal recovery and stimulus package would look like. Then I wrote about how shortsighted it is for Republicans (enabled by learned Democratic passivity) to reject aid for the struggling clean energy industry.

BREAKING: WTI crude oil futures trade at negative price for first time https://t.co/pOSyH6AVtP pic.twitter.com/XsoH1jG8WH — Bloomberg (@business) April 20, 2020

In this post, I take a look at why it is equally shortsighted for President Trump and congressional Republicans to remain so devoted to the fossil fuel industry.

The dominant narrative is still that fossil fuels are a pillar of the US economy, with giant companies like Exxon Mobil producing revenue and jobs that the US can’t afford to do without. Even among those eager to address climate change by moving past fossil fuels to clean energy — a class that includes a majority of Americans — there is a lingering mythology that US fossil fuels are, to use the familiar phrase, too big to fail.

But the position of fossil fuels in the US economy is less secure than it might appear. In fact, the fossil fuel industry is facing substantial structural challenges that will be exacerbated by, but will not end with, the Covid-19 crisis. For years, the industry has been shedding value, taking on debt, losing favor among financial institutions and investors, and turning more and more to lobbying governments to survive.

It is, in short, a turkey. CNBC financial analyst Jim Cramer put it best, back in late January, before Covid-19 had even become a crisis in the US: “I’m done with fossil fuels. They’re done. They’re just done.”

“We’re in the death knell phase,” he said “The world has turned on [fossil fuels].”

Cramer’s take is not yet conventional wisdom, but he’s right. Evidence in support appears in an April report from the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) called “Pandemic Crisis, Systemic Decline.” Let’s walk through it.

Fossil fuels are furiously lobbying for, and receiving, largesse from the US government

The UK-based think tank InfluenceMap recently did an analysis that tracks corporate lobbying in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. It found that, across the globe, the oil and gas sector has been the most active in lobbying for interventions, seeking, as CIEL summarizes, “direct and indirect support, including bailouts, buyouts, regulatory rollbacks, exemption from measures designed to protect the health of workers and the public, non-enforcement of environmental laws, and criminalization of protest, among others.” In Canada, Australia, and the UK, the industry is arguing that it must be subsidized and deregulated in order to survive.

In the US alone, the industry is seeking access to a range of stimulus funds, relief from a variety of pollution regulations, and use of the strategic petroleum reserve to bolster prices. Journalist Amy Westervelt is tracking at least a dozen other lobbying efforts. Recently the Federal Reserve changed its rules to allow bigger businesses access to “Main Street loans” (widely seen as a sop to oil and gas companies) and, as Emily Holden reports for the Guardian, records show that fossil fuel companies have already gotten $50 million in loans meant for small businesses.

The petrochemical and plastics industry, which is in large part an extension of the oil and gas industry, is exploiting the crisis as well. It has lobbied the federal government to declare an official preference for single-use plastic bags and suggested that more fresh produce should be wrapped in plastic.

The virus has not slowed down the Trump administration’s attempts to assist the industry. It is gutting fuel economy standards, which, by its own estimation, will increase pollution and eliminate 13,500 jobs a year. The EPA has dramatically eased the enforcement of pollution regulations and moved forward with its “secret science” rule, which will make it more difficult to understand and address the health impacts of air pollution — and more difficult to study the coronavirus.

During a supply glut driven by historically low prices, the Interior Department is rushing to lease federal land for oil and gas development, despite an anemic response, rock-bottom prices, and calls from conservative and taxpayer groups to suspend leasing in the face of the coronavirus.

The administration seems determined to bail out struggling shale gas companies, despite that overleveraged, debt-ridden sector being long overdue for a shakeout. (For more on that, check out Amy Westervelt’s reporting at Drilled.)

Trump is negotiating with Saudi Arabia and Russia on oil supply cuts, and has the Department of Energy buying up millions of barrels of oil for the strategic petroleum reserve, all to try to boost the price of oil to help struggling oil majors. A group of GOP senators is lobbying for fossil fuel companies, including coal companies, to be eligible for the small-business recovery fund.

Last week, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler announced that the administration, in defiance of an enormous body of evidence and recommendations from EPA scientists and staff, will not tighten restrictions on soot pollution. And on Friday, Wheeler announced that the EPA will weaken standards on mercury and other toxic metals from fossil-fueled power plants, again in opposition to the scientific consensus, based on rigged cost-benefit analysis that deliberately excluded most benefits.

Across the board, the administration is doing everything it can to help fossil fuels. But it’s a mug’s game. The industry is faltering for reasons that well predate Covid-19.

Fossil fuels were already facing structural problems before the coronavirus

US coal is in terminal decline, for reasons I’ve written about many times before. No amount of stimulus money or weaker pollution regulations can save it.

But on the surface, things look different for oil and gas. Thanks to fracking, production has been booming for the past decade, vaulting the US ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the the world’s leading oil and gas producer.

And the same goes for petrochemicals and especially plastics, which have been forecast to be the main drivers of rising petroleum demand in coming years. The industry has issued rosy projections of plastics’ growth and invested $200 billion in new petrochemical and plastics infrastructure.

But dig below the surface and things don’t look so good.

First, fracking was a financial wreck long before Covid-19 hit. US fracking operations have been losing money for a decade, to the tune of around $280 billion. Overproduction has produced a supply glut, low prices, and an accumulating surplus in storage.

CIEL reports:

Since 2015, over 200 drillers have gone bankrupt, with 32 declaring bankruptcy in 2019. At the beginning of 2020, the industry continued to struggle as natural gas prices remained low due to sluggish demand growth. By the end of the first quarter, another seven drillers had declared bankruptcy, six additional drillers had their credit outlook downgraded, and several major banks had written down the expected value of many drillers’ reserves. A recent analysis from Rystad Energy indicated that, at prevailing oil and gas prices, almost all new fracking wells drilled would lose money.

Even as its prospects grow dimmer, the enormous debt the industry has taken on over the years is coming back to bite it. Some $40 billion will come due this year alone, and around $200 billion in the next four years.

Second, both oil and gas prices were persistently low leading into 2019. Due to oversupply and mild winters in the US and Europe, there is a glut of both natural gas and oil, such that the entire world’s spare oil storage is in danger of being filled. Many big oil deals in “frontier countries” with as-yet-unexploited reserves, like Guyana, Argentina, and Mozambique, are falling through as low prices drag on.

Third, renewable energy and electric vehicles are threatening oil and gas’s dominance in both transportation, which represents 70 percent of global demand, and electricity. Natural gas’s status as a “bridge fuel” in the power sector is in increasing doubt; since 2014, orders for new gas turbines (to generate power) have fallen by half. As for transportation, a recent report from the international banking group BNP Paribas concluded that “the economics of oil for gasoline and diesel vehicles versus wind- and solar-powered EVs are now in relentless and irreversible decline.”

Fourth, oil and gas majors are revealing their own weakness by writing down assets — effectively conceding that certain reserves cannot be profitably exploited. In 2019, Chevron wrote down $11 billion worth; Spanish oil company Repsol recently wrote down $5 billion worth. Exxon Mobil, after adding Canadian tar sands assets to its books in 2017, reversed course and wrote down 3.2 billion barrels last year.

Fifth, financial institutions — “institutional and retail investors, banks, insurers, and credit rating agencies” — are catching wind of fossil fuels’ weakness and beginning to back away. Many, like Wells Fargo, BlackRock, the European Investment Bank, and the World Bank Group, are restricting investments in carbon-intensive projects. As of March 2020, asset investors worth $12 trillion had declared that they would divest from fossil fuels.

As financial institutions divest, the ones still invested in carbon-intensive projects face increasing vulnerability to lawsuits charging them with ignoring material risks. “As the risks of investing in the oil and gas sector become ever more apparent,” CIEL writes, “more and more investors subject to fiduciary duties will likely choose to steer clear of these companies.”

Like these other dismal trends, the financial turn from fossil fuels was underway well before Covid-19. Over the past decade, companies in the sector have spent more on stock buybacks and dividends than they have brought in through revenue, leading to a greater and greater debt burden. Declining confidence in the sector has made it the worst-performing sector on the S&P Index.

Finally, plastics, the great hope of the oil and gas sector, do not appear to be growing fast enough to justify the industry’s optimistic projections. Much of the US plastics industry is geared for export, but countries across the world (127 and counting) are adopting restrictions on single-use plastics. The most recent such restrictions were adopted by China, the world’s largest plastic producer and consumer. Plastics, like oil and gas, are suffering from the dual malady of overexpansion and underconsumption.

As an example that encompasses all these structural problems, CIEL cites Exxon Mobil. The company’s plan for growth involves growth in its petrochemical operations, which is now in doubt; fracking in the Permian Basin, which is now in doubt; and expanding oil production in Guyana, which is now (owing to political instability) in doubt.

All these doubts are converging as Moody’s recently revised the company’s outlook to negative. It fell out of the S&P’s top 10 for the first time, its stock hit its lowest price in a decade, the rapid rise of renewables and electric vehicles rendered billions (and perhaps soon trillions) of dollars of its assets worthless, and it is keeping shareholders happy with debt-financed dividends. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that over the past decade, Exxon Mobil has spent $64.5 billion more on payouts to stockholders than it earned in free cash flow. That can’t go on much longer.

Again: All of these structural trends predate Covid-19. But the global lockdown in response to the virus has accelerated all of them.

Oil and gas are caught in a historic downturn

Into this already dismal situation for fossil fuels came the virus and the subsequent lockdown. The vertiginous plunge in consumer demand has hit every sector of the economy, but oil and gas, already facing oversupply and persistent low prices, were particularly vulnerable.

“Oil, gas, and petrochemical stocks have been affected more rapidly and much more deeply than almost any other sector,” CIEL writes. “The oil and gas sector lost more than 45% of its total value from the beginning of January to early April 2020.”

The already declining stocks of Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and Occidental Petroleum were sent tumbling even faster. In July 2014, Exxon stock hit a high of $107; as of early April 2020, it was at $42, its lowest level in decades.

Transportation represents 70 percent of petroleum consumption, but no one is moving. Rystad Energy estimates that as of March 2020, global traffic is down 40 percent. As lockdowns remain, that number will likely drop further.

Air travel has been the fastest-growing source of demand for transport fuels, but no one is flying. “In the final week of March 2020,” CIEL writes, “commercial air traffic was almost 63% lower than in 2019.”

Public health officials warn that there could be periodic outbreaks for months or even years. Meanwhile, there are rapid advances being made everywhere in the infrastructure, technology, and practices of working remotely, from home. It’s entirely possible that auto and air travel won’t reach their pre-virus levels in the US for years, if ever.

Travel by ship is also taking a hit. Cruise ships, beset by a series of viral horror stories, have suspended operations and many analysts doubt they will ever fully recover.

Meanwhile, oversupply, exacerbated by the drop in demand, is taxing the nation’s storage capacity — the International Energy Agency says global capacity is about 85 percent full. “Nearly all observers have concluded that at projected levels of demand destruction,” CIEL writes, “the total global capacity for storing unneeded oil and gas will soon be exceeded.” At that point, many producers will be forced to simply shut down operations and write-downs will accelerate.

On top of all this has come a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, competing for the shrinking supply left over by the US supply glut. Global oil prices were at $69 per barrel in January 2020. The price of a barrel of Canadian tar sands oil appears headed into negative prices, as are Texas oil and natural gas in some parts of the US, for May futures (June prices are higher). The so-called OPEC+ group of oil-producing nations (OPEC + Russia) recently agreed to a 10 million barrel a day cut in production, but analysts agree that it is unlikely to be sufficient to stabilize prices.

(In the hours after this article was first published on April 20, oil futures for May fell to negative prices. Mind-boggling.)

When storage capacity runs out, producers are forced to pay people to take oil off their hands. (Raise your hand if you had “negative oil prices” on your 21st-century bingo card.) Even if storage doesn’t completely run out, it will be close to full, serving to suppress prices, for years. Petrochemicals and plastics don’t have it much better, with major investors delaying or dropping out of projects left and right.

“In the medium term,” CIEL writes, “the prospect of a full recovery for many of these revenue streams is, at best, uncertain, and, in many cases, unlikely.” Fossil fuels and petrochemicals could struggle for years.

And even if they eventually manage to achieve something like their pre-virus trajectory, that trajectory was sloping downward. As CIEL summarizes: “the pandemic exposes and exacerbates fundamental weaknesses throughout the sector that both predate the current crisis and will outlast it.”

Wasting stimulus money on fossil fuels makes no sense, so Trump will probably do it

Slowly but surely, the world is beginning to take global warming seriously, shifting attention and investment to materials and sources of energy that do not produce greenhouse gas emissions. As more and more jurisdictions, institutions, and investors turn away from fossil fuels, explicitly citing climate change, those left holding carbon-intensive assets will become targets of increasingly intense legal and civic activism holding them responsible for the damages.

CIEL concludes with recommendations to investors, frontier countries, and local communities: Take heed of fossil fuels’ long-term weakness when making decisions about the future. CIEL also argues that public officials “should not waste limited response and recovery resources on bailouts, debt relief, or similar supports for oil, gas, and petrochemical companies.”

Given the well-established inclinations of Trump and congressional Republicans, that recommendation is likely to fall on deaf ears, at least in the US. If Democrats do not muster the courage to stop them — and it does not seem they will — the GOP is likely to continue showering the fossil fuel industry with favors while dismissing aid to the clean energy industry as frivolous.

At best, they can slow down the transition to clean energy a bit. They cannot stop it. Adding stimulus money to fossil fuels’ already subsidy-rich diet will allow a little more pollution and a little more damage to public health for a little longer, but it’s only a delay. Meanwhile, other countries will be establishing a commanding position in some of the biggest growth industries of the 21st century.

It would be a shame to emerge from this crisis still clinging to the past rather than facing, and preparing for, the future.

Update May 1: This piece has updated to note new Federal Reserve rules to allow bigger businesses access to “Main Street loans.”

"['Terry Nguyen', 'May']",2020-04-30,Why you should talk to your child about the coronavirus,"Even as adults, it can be difficult to parse through the torrent of news and information about the coronavirus without feeling fear, anxiety, or discomfort. For those who are parents or caretakers of a young child, they don’t just have their own physical and mental health to worry about; they have kids to take care of, too. And those kids have a lot of questions.

As a result, parenting articles on navigating Covid-19 have popped up across the internet over the past few weeks and months, with titles like “How to talk to kids about coronavirus.” Vox has a piece on answering the seven big questions kids have about the pandemic, and our daily podcast Today, Explained will be releasing a kid-friendly episode that explains the coronavirus through an adventure quest format. (There is more information about the episode at the bottom of this article.)

The premise of these materials is simple: Most children have realized by now that something is happening in the world, and this phenomenon has led people to change their lifestyles and habits. It can be overwhelming for a parent to determine what to address and what to leave out, and how to honestly answer the questions a child might have. It can even be confusing whether you should talk to your child about it in the first place.

I spoke with Rachel Giannini, an early education specialist and teacher, about why it’s important to inform kids about the coronavirus and how beneficial it can be for their emotional wellbeing. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

How do we make sure kids feel emotionally safe about the coronavirus and the information that we’re getting? Why is that important?

Our littlest of littles are extraordinarily observant, and even if you’re not talking to them directly about what’s happening, they’re picking up bits and pieces of the situation. You have to recognize that young children see the world through a very different lens than adults. Adults are constructionists; we learn and analyze things from our own lived experiences. A lot of young children haven’t had our life experiences, so it can be easy for them to misconstrue a situation, especially if they don’t have enough information about it.

At the same time, there’s a lot of information out there that isn’t accurate, and obviously, we don’t want our children to be misinformed. Having conversations with your child allows you to know where their understanding is. It also helps them develop a deeper understanding of the situation because they can ask questions and have an open dialogue, so everyone can be on the same page.

What effect is this crisis currently having on kids and their future behaviors?

The coronavirus pandemic is a traumatic event; it’s unprecedented and something that’s affecting everybody. Trauma affects all of us very differently, and while adults are able to rebound from trauma, this affects children more intensely — especially those who are under 6 because their brains are still being built. If you’ve ever had a traumatic event, it can lead to adverse childhood experiences that cause toxic stress.

That’s something a lot of people are starting to flag about the current crisis. I just want to make it clear that I’m not a doctor, but studies have shown that when we experience toxic stress, our brain releases stress hormones when we are scared. Your body goes into fight-or-flight mode, basically. Wonderful things can be done to turn this off in children, like when a parent or caregiver addresses a child’s emotional concerns or gives them a hug. Those things can turn off that chemical release.

However, when that’s not turned off or that fear isn’t addressed, those hormones keep pumping out, rewire our brain, and can have lifelong effects. It can affect a child’s development, and when those kids enter the classroom, it can become a behavioral issue. If a child is always on fight-or-flight mode, they’re less likely to be engaged at school and, as I mentioned, have behavioral issues that could create a domino effect with their relationship to school and educators. Coronavirus could be an adverse childhood experience, especially with how the situation has escalated.

Are kids picking up new behaviors like consistent hand-washing and social distancing as a result of Covid-19?

The one thing about children is that things become normalized really quickly for them. The most interesting thing I’ve heard lately from a couple of friends is that their children, when playing with Legos, are spacing the figures far apart. Their toys are social distancing. One of them put up a little Lego computer and said that the Lego people are on Zoom. This is a 4-turning-5-year-old who has completely normalized what’s happening.

My downstairs neighbor who is 5 will sit on the porch with us and when somebody walks by, he’ll yell, “Social distancing!” When children are playing and they’re acting out certain coronavirus situations, like putting masks on toys or making things social distance, that’s really, really normal. Children use play as a way to work out what’s currently going on in their lives emotionally and cognitively.

When you see your child engaging in some form of play, that’s a wonderful opportunity to ask them open-ended questions like, “What’s going on? Why are your toys spread out?” That way, you can understand how your child is grappling with the situation and that’s an opportunity for you to maybe have some teachable moments. Anything that we do as adults, when we normalize it and model that behavior, children pick up on it. It can be as simple as washing our hands more or putting on a mask. That just becomes the new thing for them.

There’s been more articles and content related to informing kids about coronavirus. Is this advice generally helpful?

There’s definitely a lot of information out there, but some of it is boilerplate and not very personalized. One thing that’s frustrating is this material is not often differentiated for ages. It’s very different talking to a 5-year-old than to a 10-year-old.

Children under six have a hard time understanding abstract concepts. If you’re having an abstract conversation with a 4-year-old, for example, about how a virus or a germ is spreading, they may not quite grasp what you mean by “spreading.” Being able to put it in something that’s concrete, that they can relate to, they’ll be able to better understand the situation.

There’s something called the “zone of proximity” that explains how a child learns. You have this basic understanding, and caregivers and educators help move you through higher levels of understanding by asking questions. That’s one reason why I’m harping on this idea of finding out what your child knows and then asking them open-ended questions to allow them to really take their existing experiences and start to expand upon them.

I want everybody to start with the very bare basics of having a conversation with your kids. I know it sounds so simple, but that’s what’s beautiful about it! It’s not one size fits all. You should really think about the child and their needs. Have you recently had somebody pass away? Has your child recently started school and no longer seeing friends, or are they on the opposite end where they don’t like going to school? There are a lot of things that are very special for each specific group and it’s not until you know their level of understanding, fears, and concerns that you can address them in an authentic way.

How do we make sure this situation isn’t a scary unknown thing, but something kids are able to understand and metabolize on their own?

First of all, find out what they know. Ask them what they know, what they think, what they feel about it. While we want our children to be informed, we don’t need to give them, for example, the number of fatalities that day. You don’t want to overshare something that could trigger something else. Ask them what they already know and what they want to know. “What could I help you answer?” In any answer you give a child, you should approach it with respect, compassion, and kindness, and make sure to end it with something positive.

If a child asks, “Are people dying?” Say yes. Don’t lie, but remember to tell them that not everybody dies. Add that positive into the conversation. You can explain how we can social distance to keep our families safe or wear a mask and wash our hands more. As a parent, you can boil down the big scary thing and make it super clear and tangible as to what we can do. Children need to feel empowered; the lack of information and lack of power are two things that really trigger fear with our children. If we can solve those issues, we can help them feel empowered even in this situation.

Are there certain tips or choices in language you would suggest parents use to reassure their kids?

Respect any question they have and address it with kindness, compassion, and honesty. Don’t lie to a child, even if they ask a question like, “Am I going to die?” You can explain that death happens to everybody, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to happen anytime soon. Ask them, “What can we do to feel safe and protect our bodies?” Giving them that power, giving them that control is something helps children feel a sense of agency.

If that means making masks, putting things up on windows, calling relatives, these are ways to make sure that your child can feel that they’re safe. All these things are beneficial during this time. One thing to keep in mind is that children are extraordinarily concrete creatures. Abstract ideas are not their forte. Anything you can do to make it relatable to their life is helpful.

Listen to a special episode of our daily news podcast. Today, Explained to Kids takes kids to a magical island where some of their biggest questions about coronavirus are answered by a tree that grows books and a cave that doesn’t rest until it gets a good answer from our guest expert, science writer Brian Resnick.

"['Jen Kirby', 'May']",2020-05-01,Germany is reopening. Cautiously.,"“We are on thin ice.”

Those were German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s words to Germany’s Bundestag (parliament) on April 23, describing the country’s fight against the coronavirus.

“One could even say on thinnest ice.”

Merkel’s warning came as Germany began to pull back some of the lockdown restrictions that states had implemented in mid-March. Merkel consulted with experts and coordinated among the 16 states ahead of these reopening plans.

But even then, the moves were modest.

Shops smaller than 800-square-feet previously deemed nonessential were allowed to reopen on April 20, though with limits on the number of customers allowed inside at one time. Merkel strongly urged the use of face coverings inside shops or on public transit, though some states have since gone farther and mandated masks.

Playgrounds, museums, and churches can open again starting May 4. So can hair salons. Many secondary and primary school students will be allowed to return to school that day, though some states and localities opened slightly earlier, with priority going to students who needed to take exams to advance. Other schools will open May 11, though with social distancing rules and likely reduced schedules.

Kindergartens and daycares remain closed. So do bars, sit-down restaurants, nightclubs, and movie theaters. Mass gatherings are prohibited, for now, until August 31.

Yet Merkel continues to caution Germans against taking this “fragile” success for granted. Germany will re-evaluate the measures every two weeks, and any decisions will be “smart and careful,” based in science.

The world is watching Germany’s “careful” approach. The country has managed the coronavirus pandemic better than many of its European neighbors, much of it credited to its testing capacity, which reaches 350,000 per week, according to the New York Times.

A country of more than 80 million people, Germany has the fourth-highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Europe, with about 163,000 as of May 1. But the recorded death toll is just 6,600. In comparison, France, with a population of 66 million, has more than 167,000 cases, and more than 24,000 deaths for the same period.

But one week in, German public health officials are already warning how precarious that success is. One indicator suggested earlier this week that the number of infections might be rising again. Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany’s public health agency, encouraged Germans to “continue to stay at home as much as possible, keep observing the restrictions and keep a distance of 1.5 meters from one another.”

Germany’s slow and tentative steps toward reopening might offer a blueprint for the other parts of the world that want to start slackening some of their more stringent lockdown measures.

And it is showing how delicate a process that is. One that exists, as Merkel said, “on the thinnest of ice.”

How Germany reached the point of “reopening” — and how it made the decision to do so

Germany recorded its first confirmed case of coronavirus on January 28. A little more than three months later, cases are now around 163,000.

Even as cases surged, the country has kept its death toll low. So far, it has only registered about 6,600 deaths.

How Germany achieved that has to do with a combination of good government policy and some lucky breaks.

Germany acted early and aggressively to roll out comprehensive testing. That meant a lot more people who had no or mild symptoms got tested, helping to identify outbreaks and slow the spread.

Germany also has a robust public health care system. And, critically, its leaders carefully coordinated on any lockdown measures. Germany has 16 states, each of which is largely responsible for managing their own public health. But Merkel worked closely with the states to harmonize Germany’s very strict policies.

And Merkel, a scientist by training, straightforwardly communicated information to citizens and government officials, consulting with experts and using data to guide decisions. That likely helped increase trust among Germans about the government’s actions.

Merkel has stuck to that approach as Germany sought to reopen. Germany is closely tracking what’s known as the “effective reproduction number” — basically the number of additional coronavirus cases directly generated by one infected person. The goal is to keep that number low in order to avoid exponential growth and overload the health care system.

Merkel explained this in mid-April when she talked about the delicate balance of reopening — that if that effective reproduction number got too high too quickly, it would overload the health system. Merkel indicated that keeping that number below one was essential. For that reason, Germany’s social distancing measures would require constant reevaluation.

The video of her explanation went viral, and she gained a lot of international attention for her no-nonsense breakdown of the situation.

This is how Angela Merkel explained the effect of a higher #covid19 infection rate on the country's health system.



This part of today's press conf was great, so I just added English subtitels for all non-German speakers. #flattenthecurve pic.twitter.com/VzBLdh16kR — Benjamin Alvarez (@BenjAlvarez1) April 15, 2020

The effective reproduction number isn’t a perfect assessment, as it based on the number of those who have tested positive, and there’s typically a two-week lag time because of the coronavirus’s incubation period. But it’s still concrete data that can help inform choices, rather than just winging it.

Germany is relying on experts from a broad range of fields to help guide its reopening decisions. Leopoldina, Germany’s independent National Academy of Sciences, has been advising Merkel and Germany’s governments, and along the way, publishing “ad hoc statements” that are recommendations on best practices. In March, a working group of experts recommended a country-wide temporary shutdown for about three weeks, with physical distancing.

On April 13, shortly before Merkel announced adjustments to the measures, the working group put out another statement that offered strategies for a gradual reopening, and weighed priorities by assessing some of the legal, political, psychological, and economic implications of the lockdown measures.

“Social, cultural and sporting events should begin taking place step by step, subject to the possibility of physical distancing and provided the intensity of contact is low,” the statement reads. “Infection rates must continue to be monitored.”

The advisory grapples with the challenges of easing measures amid a global pandemic where there’s still a lot of information experts simply do not know. For example, it its plan to gradually reopen schools, it notes that closures have led to a decline in daycare services and learning, and may have worsened inequality.

There are also practical concerns that factor in as Germany prepares to map its future. Some places, specifically Bavaria, were hit harder than others. Some regions had key industries that had to be considered. Merkel has acknowledged there will be differences in how each state handles the easing of restrictions, but she has consulted with state governors before making announcements on lockdown plans and tried to find ways to unify politics, where possible.

It’s a balancing act, between the risks of a deadly pandemic, and the economic, political, and social health of the nation and different regions of Germany. And it’s an imperfect one.

“It’s basically an exercise of compromise,” Ralph Hertwig, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, told me. “Merkel is a very consensus-oriented political leader and tries to bring these different views together.”

Hertwig added that, even in making those compromises, these decisions have been “informed by scientific input.”

What happens now? Wait and evaluate.

“It’s still wait and see,” said Frank Rösler, professor of biological psychology and neuropsychology at the University of Hamburg, who has contributed to Leopoldina’s three ad hoc statements about the pandemic.

“The problem, I think, is nowhere in the world does anybody have real good data to make a good prediction of what’s going to happen,” he added.

Small shops have reopened, but so far, the crowds haven’t come. Employees wear masks; so do shoppers. Strict limits are still in place on how many people can be in stores at once.

Some schools have resumed operations, and others are preparing to reopen next week, with desks placed 1.5 meters apart and facilities stocked with disinfectants. But some students, fearful about contracting and spreading the virus, or unsure about how they will learn in such a strange environment, are boycotting.

Playgrounds, zoos, museums, and houses of worship could be allowed to reopen as soon as Monday — as long as they continue to meet social distancing guidelines and hygiene requirements — though some states may adopt different timelines.

On May 6, Merkel and state governors will meet again to discuss a “further-reaching package” for bringing Germany, gradually, to emerge from the lockdown. By then, much more data will be available on how the openings of some shops and services have affected, or not, the spread of the coronavirus.

But Merkel remains circumspect. “Every time the restrictions are relaxed, people move around more,” she said. “Therefore, we must constantly keep an eye on the effects of the relaxation. We have to stay disciplined, keep a safe distance, and follow hygiene measures.”

She warned that if infections crept up again, governments would need to react.

Germany, then, is at a critical moment, this in-between time where it is not fully opened but no longer fully closed. Now that it has begun to creep toward normalcy, it may be even harder to pull back if infections pick back up, or another wave arrives.

And in weighing what can reopen and what can’t, new complications will emerge that could threaten some of the consensus-building Merkel has so skillfully executed.

“I think it’s the moment now, when Germany is slowly opening up, that you begin to hear critique, sometimes regarding certain decisions, like why open this up and why keep this closed,” Sudha David-Wilp, a senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund, told me.

Shop owners or companies of bigger stores might complain that only stores of a certain size are allowed to open, for example. Parents of young kids might complain: “Why can’t my kids go back to school?” And parents of older kids and teenagers might say: “Why do my kids have to take the risk and be the first to go back?”

“You have this dynamic that immediately starts when you make an exception here, and that’s a problem,” Hertwig said. “It’s like a chain of domino pieces, and once you kick up the first one, it starts this dynamic process.”

It might be harder, then, to pull back new freedoms if infections begin to rise again. Germans were remarkably unified in backing the lockdown measures (even 83 percent of the far-right party Alternative for Deutschland supported social distancing measures, according to a poll) in the beginning of April, but as time wears on, that may wane.

Germany saw some protests this week against the lockdown measures, even after some restrictions were loosened. These are likely still outliers. But moving out of lockdown, even slowly and deliberately, is not easy.

What does Germany’s example mean for the rest of the world?

Germany’s experiment with reopening is happening in real-time. And that might be the biggest lesson for the rest of the world, including the United States, as it continues to evaluate how to reopen society: It’s not necessarily a linear path toward normalcy.

Right now, Germany is relying heavily on data, including that effective reproduction number. That number ticked up to just under 1 this week, and public health officials reiterated the importance of maintaining social distancing measures.

But, on Thursday, that number fell back down to .70, according to the Robert Koch Institute. “This is of course also a positive development. And as I said, let’s keep it that way,” Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute said Thursday.

What that number looks like in the next few weeks might offer more clarity on whether Germany can keep the measures where they are, loosen them further, or maybe tighten them up.

William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told me on a press call with reporters Wednesday that even if the effective reproduction number goes up, that doesn’t necessarily mean refining or relaxing restriction isn’t possible.

“But it does indicate, very clearly, that these actions have consequences,” he said. “And so we should be similarly prepared as we start doing things in United States, to be watching very carefully and to be trying to look at those changes in the effective reproductive number, and then gaming them out into the future to ensure that we don’t find ourselves riding another exponential.”

But, as experts I spoke to noted, even beyond the data, evaluating the lockdown is going to involve weighing the risks of the coronavirus — which are very real — with the economic and psychological necessity of giving people back their freedom. But there is no magic formula for that right now, because there is no way to predict the future and all of the unintended consequences of reopening.

And Germany isn’t the only country reopening. Others, such as Denmark and Austria, have also loosened measures. Places in East Asia, like Hong Kong, have taken their own approach to social distancing. Experts told me that ideally, the world would coordinate together on best practices, and try to figure out what works and what doesn’t, improving the reopening model in real-time.

“There is no perfect solution to this,” David-Wilp said. “Germany, as other countries, are in uncharted territory.”

"['Liz Nelson', 'May']",2020-05-01,Talking to kids about coronavirus,"The novel coronavirus pandemic is affecting every aspect of our lives, and kids are experiencing the same fears, doubts, and feelings of powerlessness we all do but with fewer tools and life experiences to process information and cope with emotions. And they have questions. Ask any parent or teacher and you’ll likely hear about the very particular questions children have, and how we adults are struggling to answer them.

“Today, Explained to Kids,” a special episode of our daily explainer podcast Today, Explained, gives kids back some of that power in the best way we know how: by explaining scary things and dispelling fears with facts. Fun facts.

The episode takes kids to a secret island where they get answers to two of their biggest questions about coronavirus: how it spreads and why they can’t go to school right now. Kids and grown-ups will learn five to six takeaways about each question from some very cool special guests, including Corona, the traveling virus, and a curious fellow who lives in a cave full of questions.

Listen to the episode with your young people, or just because, and then come back here to download four fun learning exercises you can do with kids (or, again, by yourself) that build on what we learned in the episode.

"['Philip Klinkner', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,The pandemic is hitting counties that voted for Hillary Clinton harder — for now,"There’s a stark partisan difference in who has been affected by the coronavirus: Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to live in communities hit hard by Covid-19.

This has contributed to a partisan divide in attitudes about the pandemic, one in which Republican governors, lawmakers, and voters have remained broadly supportive of Trump — and have pushed for policies like the rapid reopening of businesses — while Democrats have not.

It is well known that the disease has disproportionately hit large cities and metropolitan areas. Given the geographic pattern of American political polarization, this also means that Democratic areas of the country have suffered the most from the pandemic, while Republican areas — despite recent outbreaks in smaller towns as the disease has spread at meatpacking plants — have been hit relatively lightly, if at all.

As of April 27, according to county-level case data compiled by the New York Times, Covid-19 cases and deaths were far more prevalent in counties won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 than in counties won by Donald Trump. Clinton counties make up a slight majority of the US population, but so far they have seen 76 percent of the Covid-19 cases and 80 percent of the deaths. Trump counties are 44 percent of the population, but just 24 percent of Covid-19 cases and 20 percent of the deaths.

This means Democrats and Republicans have experienced the pandemic in objectively different ways. These differences are already shaping the nation’s pandemic response — and may well influence American politics for years to come.

Covid-19 has hit counties won by Hillary Clinton much harder

On April 8, 77 percent of cases and 80 percent of deaths were in Clinton counties, versus 23 percent of cases and 20 percent of deaths in Trump counties. Despite some evidence of the virus spreading to more rural and Republican areas, these numbers have not changed over the past three weeks.

Of course, the true number of Covid-19 cases and deaths is unknown because of the lack of widespread testing. Still, given that the gap between Democratic and Republican areas hasn’t changed as more testing has become available suggests that the disparity between urban and rural areas is not just an artifact of incomplete testing.

Overall, Clinton counties have had nearly 2.5 times more cases per 100,000 people, and 3.2 times more deaths per 100,000 people, than Trump counties.

But these overall numbers obscure how the disease has had the most impact in heavily Democratic areas, but the least impact in heavily Republican areas.

In counties where Hillary Clinton won in a landslide (20 percentage points or more), there have been 486 cases per 100,000 people. Where Trump won in a landslide there have been only 120 cases per 100,000 people. And this is not just because of New York City, the nation’s biggest metropolis and a Democratic stronghold, as well as the city worst-hit by the pandemic: Excluding New York City only drops the rate in Clinton landslide counties to 364 cases per 100,000 people.

Similarly, in Clinton landslide counties there have been 27 deaths per 100,000 people; in Trump landslide counties, there have 5 deaths per 100,000. Even without New York City this pattern holds with Clinton landslide counties still having 17 deaths per 100,000 people.

Trump voters are also heavily concentrated in counties with few Covid-19 cases or deaths. In fact, a majority of Trump voters (56 percent) live in counties with fewer than 100 cases compared to a majority of Clinton voters (56 percent) living in counties with more than 500 cases.

The same is true for deaths. Almost one in five (18 percent) Trump voters live in a county with zero deaths from Covid-19. Half of Trump voters (49 percent) live in a county with 10 or fewer deaths. In comparison, only 31 percent of Clinton voters live in these counties.

As much as we might like to think that this crisis will unite Americans across party lines, the reality is very different. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to reside in counties with large numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths and therefore much more likely to have a friend, neighbor, coworker, or family member affected by the disease, not to mention possibly contracting the virus themselves.

On the other hand, for many Republicans, the disease and the deaths associated with it are more likely to be abstractions, something with little if any direct impact on them or their community so far.

Democrats and Republicans’ opposite coronavirus experiences are leading to opposing views on policy

There is some evidence these vastly different experiences are contributing to Democratic and Republican lawmakers — and voters —advocating for divergent policies. For instance, an April 19-21 Economist/YouGov survey found 81 percent of Democrats worried about contracting the virus, compared to only 54 percent of Republicans. This gap has not changed over the course of the pandemic. Another Economist/YouGov poll in mid-March found 71 percent of Democrats worried about contracting the virus compared to only 45 percent of Republicans.

Similarly, the April Economist survey found that 26 percent of Republicans thought that people were overreacting to the risk of the virus, but only 6 percent of Democrats did.

For Republicans, concentrated in counties with few cases, the primary impacts of the pandemic are the economic and social dislocations caused by business shutdowns and stay-at-home orders, which is affecting Democratic and Republican areas more equally than the disease itself: the April Economist survey found no difference between Democrats and Republicans on how much income they have lost due to the shutdown.

To be sure, Republican Party leaders, from President Trump on down, have presented mixed messages or inaccurate information about the disease. This misinformation may well have contributed to Republican attitudes about the pandemic from the start.

But the relatively light impact of the virus in Republican areas gives Republican officials and conservative commentators a receptive audience when they claim that stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns cause too much economic damage and threaten personal liberty, or when Fox News stars like Tucker Carlson, Britt Hume, and Laura Ingraham claim that the official death toll from the pandemic is inflated.

Furthermore, anti-lockdown protests have sprung up in several states. To be sure, conservative groups have organized and directed these protests for their own purposes and the number of persons involved is still relatively small.

Nonetheless, the protests have been supported by a number of prominent Republicans, including President Trump who tweeted out calls to, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!”; “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!”; AND “LIBERATE VIRGINIA.” Given this support, the protests seem likely to continue — and perhaps escalate — if Republican areas remain relatively untouched by the virus but continue to suffer economic damage. Exactly that happened in Lansing, Michigan, where protesters crowded into the state Capitol building and tried to gain access to the House floor while legislators debated whether to extend Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s emergency declaration.

Still, at the federal level, we have seen lawmakers advocating for economic aid on a bipartisan (albeit asymmetrical) basis, resulting in the implementation of programs like the Paycheck Protection Program. But the parties have been divided more on public health measures. Passage of last week’s small business relief bill was held up because Democrats insisted, over Republicans objections, on including money for hospitals and more testing.

The differential impact of the pandemic also gives us clues about how the 2020 election might play out. Democrats will likely continue to criticize President Trump’s erratic and ineffectual response to the crisis and the need for the federal government to provide funding to meet the ongoing medical and economic emergency. President Trump, meanwhile, might argue that his actions have limited the pandemic at least in the areas where most of his voters reside, while Republicans might accuse Democrats of hyping the crisis in order to ramp up government spending for their voters in large urban areas.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office has already called aid to state and local governments devastated by the pandemic “Blue State Bailouts.” Such a message is all the more pernicious and perhaps more effective since it triggers prejudices related to race, religion, and immigration. If so, it seems likely that the pandemic will only deepen America’s chronic social and political divides.

"['Theodore Schleifer', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,The obscure rule that is discouraging billionaires’ foundations from going big on coronavirus,"For all the good that some billionaires like Bill Gates have done for the world during the coronavirus pandemic, the philanthropies of the rich are still sitting on $1.2 trillion in assets that could make a difference, right now.

Just because these millionaires and billionaires have poured money into their charitable foundations, it doesn’t necessarily mean that those foundations have then given that money away. These foundations generally give away just 5 percent a year. And they are likely to keep disbursing the same percentage of their money they typically do, despite the unprecedented public health and economic crisis.

“A fire is spreading and they have a giant tank of water. And we’re just going to spend 5 percent of the water?” said Vu Le, a popular writer on nonprofit issues. “Everyone is in denial.”

Few charitable foundations have signaled that they are departing from the usual protocol, which is why some like Le feel that the wealthy are not meeting this moment.

One of the few rules in the world of charity is that foundations must give away this 5 percent. But almost all foundations have taken it as a maxim that they’ll never do a penny more than that 5 percent, the legal minimum. Some do this out of inertia, while others stick to spending only 5 percent a year out of a desire to exist perpetually and to retain their war chests for when some future crisis hits.

For many of these foundations, however, the coronavirus is likely the greatest call to arms in a century. So what are they waiting for?

This question has long simmered as an inside-baseball matter in the world of philanthropy. And only about 20 percent of total US giving comes from foundations. But a series of recent announcements from two Silicon Valley philanthropies — and candid admissions from leaders like Gates — has uncorked an old debate, now set against higher stakes than ever.

Two Silicon Valley foundations make different decisions

Last week, Jeff Skoll, the first full-time employee at eBay, said he would quadruple the amount of money that his foundation would spend in 2020 by putting another $100 million into his foundation for Covid-19. In addition to the new injection of cash, Skoll’s team said he would dig deeper into its existing endowment to come up with a total of $200 million in foundation giving this year. Skoll has said that his total coronavirus-related giving across different vehicles could reach as high as $500 million in 2020.

On the other side sits the Hewlett Foundation, which has taken some flak in the philanthropy community for announcing a few weeks ago that it does not plan to spend more money in 2020 than it originally budgeted, and also that it’ll likely donate less money next year due to a decline in the value of its endowment. Why? Because the Hewlett Foundation is, per its bylaws, meant to exist in perpetuity, so it is reluctant to give too much away and deviate from 5 percent (although it will end up doing so unintentionally in 2020, due to the unanticipated drop in the value of its endowment).

“We’ve never seen anything like this crisis. Climate change is a pretty big crisis. Do you want to say this is a bigger crisis than that?” Fay Twersky, a top Hewlett official, asked Recode. “We have long-term partners in that field who depend on us to fight that really big crisis.”

Hewlett may be one of the few foundations to go public about its thinking, but it is hardly alone in thinking this way. Twersky said she has been flooded with appreciative emails after they set off this debate. Le, though, has called Hewlett’s decision “truly disappointing.”

“Perpetuity is a paternalistic, narcissistic notion,” Le said. “‘We know what’s best for you. We know in the future there’s going to be problems.’”

Often left unmentioned in many of these debates is the fact that the decade-long tear in the stock market has made these foundations richer than ever. There shouldn’t need to be this trade-off between the present and the future. Philanthropists could do both.

Foundations gave away $82 billion in grants in 2017, the most recent year with full records, which sounds like a lot. But the average foundation’s endowment grew by 15 percent during that same year, for instance, thanks to investing their assets in a bull market, even before any donors, if they’re still alive, put any new money in. Put another way: Their war chest is typically larger each December than it was in that year’s January. So while some foundations are indeed seeing short-term flashes of red — Hewlett expects its $10 billion endowment to lose money this year — these foundations are hardly risking long-term insolvency.

Other foundations don’t give more because of inertia. Big foundations give 5 percent away each year because, well, that’s the legal requirement and that’s what other foundations grant. That’s just the way it is.

For instance, Silicon Valley’s charitable foundations recently released new tax records for how they spent their money in 2018. And a Recode review of these filings shows that almost all of them spent just about 5 percent of their assets, a “payout rate” that includes some operating expenses, to boot.

So while Google co-founder Sergey Brin has piled $1.4 billion into his family foundation in recent years, only about $58 million actually went out the door in 2018 to back everything from Stanford University to Burning Man. And that’s to say nothing of the other possible loopholes to meeting the 5 percent requirement, such as routing the money to a different charitable vehicle, like a donor-advised fund, as Brin’s co-founder, Larry Page, did to the tune of $200 million in 2018 from his $3 billion foundation.

“There’s a norm and a default to a way of working. There’s a conservatism,” said Phil Buchanan, who along with eight other foundation leaders released an open letter pushing for foundations to at least think about giving away substantially more. “This really is a different moment, requiring questioning of norms that might’ve made a lot more sense in a different context.”

The upshot of all of this is stark. If foundations don’t have access to more money from a living donor like Skoll, and won’t increase their payout rate, they’re left with two options: do nothing substantial on a once-in-a-century pandemic or try to rejigger their existing commitments, meaning that some nonprofits and causes will miss out on expected money.

Indeed, Buchanan said he has heard from some nonprofits that have been told by their funders that they will not be receiving as much as they expected due to the funder’s need to pivot for Covid-19 relief.

Gates gave voice to this the past weekend when he explained how his foundation is shifting “almost entirely” to the coronavirus. Gates has announced that his organization is spending at least $250 million on it. He hasn’t said whether he’s putting more money into the Foundation to fill that funding hole, like Skoll is, but he has indicated that that other work — his Foundation’s research on non-Covid diseases, such as measles, polio, and AIDS — would directly suffer because of the Foundation’s new priorities as at least one limited resource, staff time, is refocused. That statement angered some, such as HIV activists.

“This emergency has distracted a lot of critical work in many, many areas,” Gates told the Financial Times in a recent interview.

And at the Open Society Foundation, the philanthropy of hedge fund billionaire George Soros, more than 200 employees confronted their bosses in an extraordinary display of internal dissent. The employees questioned whether the foundation’s recently announced $130 million commitment to the coronavirus would leave its existing grantees in a lurch. Leaders claimed they would not, but the rebuke and the ensuing leak this week show the deep concern about these trade-offs.

Foundations like Hewlett, whose founder died two decades ago, don’t have access to more money like Skoll does. So their options are more limited. But if today’s living billionaires want to avoid this trade-off, no one is stopping them from sinking more money into their foundations. Their personal net worths, like the stock market, have ballooned over the last decade. They could do it all — fund the immediate response, the economic recovery, their existing commitments — and still have plenty left over.

"['Li Zhou', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,The Senate doesn’t have enough coronavirus tests to make sure all 100 lawmakers get screened,"When senators return to DC on Monday, there won’t be enough coronavirus tests for all of them to get proactively screened.

According to a report from Politico’s Burgess Everett and Marianne LeVine, the Capitol’s attending physician, Brian Monahan, informed Republicans about the dearth of tests during a phone call on Thursday. In this conversation, Monahan said that lawmakers and staffers who are in need of tests would likely be able to get one, but added that capacity is so limited that it wouldn’t be enough to cover all 100 senators.

Despite ongoing concerns about the coronavirus’s spread, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has nevertheless expressed confidence in the decision to have the Senate return to the Capitol on May 4. The House, however, will not be following suit. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced that members would not physically come back to DC just yet, after conversations with Monahan earlier this week.

The Capitol’s limited testing capacity is concerning in itself: Many senators are over the age of 65 and within the range of individuals who are more likely to experience severe coronavirus symptoms. And while in the Capitol, their work inherently brings them, and staffers, into close contact with one another.

Prior to departing for recess, senators were spotted in tight groups on the chamber floor during a stimulus vote. And when Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) tested positive for Covid-19, several of his colleagues including Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) had to self-isolate out of concerns about their exposure.

The Senate’s testing shortage is also emblematic of a broader problem the country continues to face: Even after recovering from a slow start on the subject, America’s testing capacity is still very far from what it needs to be for regular business and social gatherings to resume.

The limited testing capacity on the Hill is emblematic of the issue the country is still struggling with

There are many compelling reasons for Congress to return to the Capitol including, specifically the need to advance more much-needed stimulus for workers and businesses that are reeling from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.

“We have a crisis to continue to work through. Our services are necessary. And in order to perform those services, we have to perform them here in Washington,” Lee said in a floor speech in April.

The big question, however, is whether lawmakers will be able to return and work on legislation — as well as McConnell’s coveted judicial nominations — in a safe way. Several Democrats have voiced concerns about the ability to do so given the information offered by the Capitol physician about the current state of the pandemic.

As Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) noted in a statement, one senator, eight Capitol police officers, and 11 construction workers on a House renovations project have already tested positive for the coronavirus. She argued that lawmakers would be increasing the risk of spreading the disease to themselves and their staff by returning.

“The Attending Physician of Congress, Dr. Brian Monahan, advised House leadership that he recommends against resuming their session,” Feinstein said in a statement. “That’s why I ask the majority leader to reconsider his plan to reconvene the Senate.” The House, after all, announced earlier this week that it would not return next week based on concerns that Monahan had expressed about the growing number of cases in the Washington DC area.

McConnell has said there will be certain precautions taken to address lawmakers’ worries, including staggered voting.

Still, given the Capitol’s limited testing capacity, it’s unclear if Congress actually has the resources it needs to proceed in a secure fashion. As Politico reports, the Capitol physician notes that tests will take roughly two days to turn around for those who need them.

The uncertainty surrounding Congress’s return is similar to that hanging over states’ decisions to slowly reopen businesses and the broader economy: While there’s obviously an urgency around doing so, the shortages in testing make it very difficult to move forward without running the risk of spreading the virus even further.

As Vox’s German Lopez has reported, increasing the number of available tests is vital because it enables doctors and the government to identify who’s sick and attempt to trace others they’ve contacted in order to prevent further spread. As of last week, the US wasn’t doing enough, Lopez writes.

Whatever the case, even the best days of testing in the US are still far from what experts say is necessary to allow the country to safely reopen the economy. On the low end, experts say the US should be able to do a minimum of 500,000 tests a day. At the high end, some have called for much more — up to the tens of millions a day. So far, America isn’t even getting close to the low-end requirement.

In lieu of ramping up testing to a sufficient level, the main option is to continue social distancing — both in Congress and beyond.

Congress’s stumbles over remote voting have made it tough to advance legislation from afar

Since the pandemic hit earlier this year, Congress has struggled to legislate remotely, in part because there’s no clear mechanism to vote remotely on bills.

Although House Democrats are interested in advancing a proposal that would enable “proxy voting” in which some members can designate others to physically represent them on the floor, these plans have generated pushback from Republicans. In the Senate, too, McConnell has shot down an effort by Paul to advance a temporary remote voting procedure.

The push for lawmakers to return makes a lot of sense in the context of what’s still needed to help the US weather the massive unemployment and business shortfalls that have resulted since the coronavirus spurred stringent social distancing policies and closures.

The need to risk their personal health — and that of their staffers — in order to advance the country’s legislative needs, however, is a dilemma that could be resolved by approving remote voting procedures.

"['Sara Morrison', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Let’s check in on Trump’s plan to bring drive-through testing to a drugstore near you,"It’s May 1, and seven weeks have passed since the World Health Organization’s declaration of a global pandemic. And while President Trump still maintains America has “done a great job of Testing” as recently as today, the country has yet to significantly scale its testing up to where experts say it needs to be. But a renewed effort from retail drug store chains is finally showing some promise, even if it will never be the completely accessible testing solution Trump implied it would be.

On April 28, President Trump said the country was “getting very close” to running 5 million coronavirus tests every day. This would represent an incredible 25-fold increase over the approximately 200,000 tests that were run that day, and the president said that goal would be achieved in the “very near future” and “very soon.” If true, a surge in testing of this magnitude could be a game changer, considering that many experts believe we will need to run that many tests — or more — to safely reopen the country.

But Trump’s promise actually amounted to a fantasy. The 5 million tests a day figure surely surprised the public health officials responsible for coordinating those tests, given that the assistant secretary of health and testing czar Brett Girior said earlier that same day that 5 million tests per day was impossible. Sure enough, 24 hours later, Trump walked back his 5 million daily test claim, arguing that he never said the United States would run that many tests per day. The more realistic reality, according to Girior, was 8 million tests in the entire month of May.

What unfolded over the course of those two days is a pretty good representation of how Trump’s proposed public-private partnerships involving retail drug stores and big tech have fared so far. A Vox analysis found that they’ve only contributed a fraction of tests to the 6 million conducted, with testing sites at just 1 percent of the participating chains’ physical locations — or less.

Now, Trump might be setting the country up for another letdown. On April 27, he re-introduced the drive-through testing effort with the help of top executives from CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Rite Aid, and Kroger. A newly signed bill allots $25 billion to testing programs, and with recent improvements to testing capacity and the supply chain, perhaps the widespread testing sites promised so many weeks ago will truly arrive now.

So there are some signs that the second phase of these public-private partnerships might be much more successful than the first, perhaps even fulfilling the initial promise. But there is also evidence that even if it is, those sites may not make it to the “critical” or even “convenient” locations the president said they would.

Trump promised drive-through testing at “virtually every” retail pharmacy location in the US. That didn’t happen.

In contrast to the virus response from other countries, the Trump administration has been reluctant to deploy, let alone finance, the kind of comprehensive, national mass testing plan many experts have called for. Instead, the president placed the onus on respective states and private businesses to carry out piecemeal efforts with limited assistance from the federal government. This is all very apparent, now that the administration’s much-hyped partnerships with retail drug stores have produced disappointing results.

Following Trump’s press conference in March, CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and Target worked with the federal and state administrations to open drive-through testing sites across the country. The results of their efforts have been underwhelming. Trump had said Covid-19 tests would be “available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals” at a network of stores in “virtually every location” of the country. Trump also announced that Google was building a site that would “facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” which would go live within the next few days.

These turned out to be gross exaggerations from the president. From the beginning, the Washington Post reported, anonymous health officials said Trump’s announcement came as a surprise to them and that state health departments weren’t at all ready to help implement it. Company representatives didn’t have many details about the rollout of the promised testing sites. And Google had to tweet that the testing website was actually a product of life sciences company Verily — both Google and Verily are subsidiaries of Alphabet — which would initially roll out in the Bay Area. There were no plans for a national testing program at the time. Google launched its own information portal a week later, which was educational but did not include many of the features Trump promised.

The retail companies featured in the first press conference — CVS, Target, Walmart, and Walgreens — gradually opened testing sites over the ensuing weeks. But they didn’t open that many of them. A month after Trump’s announcement, Business Insider found only 8 sites were operating among three of the companies. The fourth, Walgreens, wasn’t able to open the first batch of its promised 15 locations until April 17. Target opened only one site and appears to have dropped out of the effort. Rite Aid, which joined the effort later, had two sites. Meanwhile, none of these testing sites also offered tests to anyone who wanted one; tests were reserved for people who met certain criteria in order to make the limited supply available to the people most likely to need them.

In the past couple of weeks, these retail companies have expanded their efforts considerably. By the time Trump announced the renewed effort on April 27, four of the companies had 57 testing sites among them, 50 of which opened a month after the March 13 announcement, according to the companies’ press releases. Verily expanded its platform from the pilot sites in California to power Rite Aid’s 25 testing sites, providing an online portal for screening patients, scheduling tests, and delivering results. The second Trump press conference also featured supermarket chain Kroger, which has 30 test sites, though they appear to represent a partnership with states rather than the federal government. Rite Aid and Kroger’s sites are at 1 percent of their locations, and they both have more sites and fewer stores than their peers.

The numbers from all of these companies’ testing sites stills seem low. Kroger, CVS, and Walmart performed at least 74,000 tests, which represents a small fraction of the approximately 6 million tests run nationwide since March 13, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Walmart did not respond to Recode’s request for total tests run but said in a recent press release that it ran 13,000 tests at one of its 20 sites. Verily said it has facilitated testing for 19,500 people, but that figure includes non-Rite Aid sites. Rite Aid would not give Recode its figures. Walgreens didn’t respond to repeated requests for its overall testing numbers.

Several valid reasons could explain why these numbers sound so small compared to the total number of tests conducted in the US. It takes time to set these things up, including coordinating with labs and testing personnel to get and run the tests and public health authorities to tell them where their efforts should be focused and provide the funding for the tests, which were free to qualified patients. There were major supply issues, including the personal protective equipment workers need while in close proximity to potentially infected people all day long. CVS told Recode that its biggest obstacle when trying to increase the number of sites was “the availability of testing equipment and capacity of the labs to process the tests.”

The new public-private push for testing seems more promising but doesn’t solve every problem

The second phase of drive-through testing at retail locations looks more promising than the first. There are now 87 sites up and running. Companies have paired up with test providers and labs to process the tests. Many supply chain shortages have been fixed or at least significantly improved. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also expanded its guidelines for who can get tested — increasingly, anyone who wants a test truly can get one.

In their latest press releases, the companies involved in the public-private partnership say they will be able to perform 2 million tests per month at more than 1,150 locations in at least 49 states and Puerto Rico by the end of May. (That’s assuming they’re ultimately able to open as many locations and do as many tests as they say will.) CVS will contribute a major chunk of this — 1,000 locations and 1.5 million tests per month — but says those numbers are still “subject to availability of supplies and lab capacity.”

That might still not be enough. Experts have said the US should be testing at least 500,000 people per day to safely reopen; 2 million tests per month is about 65,000 tests per day. So, even if these retail pharmacies and grocery stores do hit their goals, they will only provide about a 10th of the tests the country needs.

Assuming the retailers do hit their goals in terms of numbers, the challenge then is ensuring those tests go to the places that truly need them. Despite initial promises from the government and retailers that they would focus testing sites on the areas that needed them most, a Vox and Type Investigations analysis of Chicago data found that testing sites were few and far between in the minority neighborhoods that were disproportionately affected by the virus. Not one of the five retailers offers coronavirus tests in New York City.

It seems that plopping drive-through testing sites down on parking lots leaves out the people who don’t have access to cars or who live in neighborhoods that don’t have those retail stores in the first place. Perhaps this problem will be solved, too: Some of the participating companies said they plan to focus their expanded efforts on underserved areas. Given that this was also promised back in March, there is reason to be skeptical.

As it is, it’s yet another way disadvantaged people are being left behind in these public-private partnerships, exposing the considerable limits of them. Profit-focused businesses will never serve everyone, whether it’s Apple and Google building a contact tracing tool that can only be used by people who own their phones or huge pharmacy chains offering free coronavirus tests that are only available to the people who have access to the sites performing them.

Frankly, it’s not up to Google or CVS or any business to ensure that all the people in this country are provided for. It’s up to the government. There are other testing sites throughout the country run by county and state health departments and health care providers, for instance, and they’re available to more people now than ever. But they’re still not available to everyone, and they won’t be at every single participating drugstore location anytime soon — if ever.

"['German Lopez', 'May']",2020-05-01,Why America’s coronavirus testing barely improved in April,"America still has a big coronavirus testing problem.

In the past week, the situation seems to have improved. Daily testing numbers have gone up. President Donald Trump suggested, and then later backtracked, that the US will do 5 million Covid-19 tests a day “very soon.” The White House claimed that the US has the machines to conduct more than 2 million tests a day. Labs have claimed they have unused capacity.

These developments would be crucial to ending social distancing. All of the major plans to do so, including Trump’s, rely on much more testing to track and contain the coronavirus outbreak. On the low end, the plans call for 500,000 tests a day. On the high end, they call for tens of millions of tests.

But despite recent improvements, the country still faces a major obstacle to scaling up testing: a supply shortage. Every test requires an extensive supply line to work correctly — one that ensures a sample is collected from a patient, then shipped to a lab, then tested at that lab, and then, finally, the result is reported back to the patient. Each of these steps requires a whole host of people and materials to function.

In the past few weeks, problems have emerged every step of the way — whether it’s a shortage in personal protective equipment for the health care workers collecting a sample, in nasal swabs, in the ingredients to run the tests, or in machines to run specific kinds of tests.

It’s these blocks that keep the United States’ testing far below the 500,000 to tens of millions that experts have called for. The US averaged almost 220,000 tests a day over the last week of April, according to the Covid Tracking Project, which gathers state data. It’s an improvement from the earlier weeks in the month, when the US averaged around 150,000 tests a day — but a small improvement overall, and still far short of what experts say is needed.

The US also lags behind other countries. When accounting for population, the US testing rate is a little more than half of Italy’s, one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic. It’s about two-thirds of Germany’s, which has been widely praised for its quick response to the crisis.

Some Trump administration officials acknowledge they have a problem: “We need to significantly ramp up not only the number of tests, but the capacity to perform them,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Time magazine on April 23. “I am not overly confident right now at all that we have what it takes to do that.”

To continue pushing the numbers up, experts say there’s a need for more federal coordination. Labs simply can’t fix these problems on their own, because many of the problems precede them, starting with how samples are collected in a clinic or hospital. States are also limited in their ability to act since the supplies they need — from swabs to reagents to machines — can originate in other parts of the US or the world.

So far, the Trump administration has been slow to act. It has taken some action, like a recent boost with the Defense Production Act to ramp up testing swab production. Congress also recently allocated $25 billion for testing and required the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a “strategic testing plan” that will, among other things, attempt to boost testing capacity.

But the administration has hesitated in taking more aggressive, proactive action. In fact, a recent “blueprint” put out by the administration mostly pinned the problem on the states, arguing that it’s up to the states to plan for, find, and fix testing-related problems with help from the private sector. The federal government will play a largely supplemental role with “guidelines,” “strategic direction,” and “technical assistance,” acting only as a “supplier of last resort.”

“They know that the federal response has been a disaster, and so now their strategy is blame 50 states,” Ashish Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told the Guardian.

So America remains stuck. Any progress on testing is coming very slowly, even as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continues to grow. And the nation’s ability to safely reopen the economy remains out of reach.

An intricate supply chain goes into every test

A lot more goes into completing a coronavirus test than you might think.

First, a patient has to go into a clinic, hospital, pharmacy, lab, or drive-through to get a test, which requires those places to have capacity for another patient. Second, a health care worker has to be available, with both the proper training and personal protective equipment necessary, to collect a sample from the patient. Next, that sample has to be collected with the right tool, such as a nasal swab. Then, the sample needs to be stored and sent to a lab, which will need the staff and a specific set of ingredients, or reagents, to run the test. Finally, the result is reported back to the patient.

“Lab testing is a cycle that starts the second someone thinks about getting a test and ends the second the test result is acted upon,” Geoffrey Baird, a pathologist at the University of Washington, told me. “But there’s a lot of steps in between.”

Every step of this process must go smoothly to get a test done, with specific requirements and intricacies in the supply chain that fuels this process.

A single — sometimes unexpected — hitch can slow everything down. Kimberle Chapin, the lab director at Lifespan Academic Medical Centers in Rhode Island, explained how a single test manufacturer accidentally contaminated 100,000 kits nationwide during production. Since that manufacturer’s kit was needed to run tests on the manufacturer’s machine, the blunder effectively halted tests of that kind until more kits could be sent out. “That threw a major kink into testing around the country,” Chapin said. “That one little hiccup.”

In some ways, the whole country went through this kind of issue early on. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) originally produced and sent out the tests that labs were supposed to use to test for Covid-19. But the CDC reportedly contaminated a part of its test and took weeks to fix the mistake, causing testing to come to a complete standstill throughout most of February. Only with the CDC’s fix and the Food and Drug Administration’s move to let more private labs run their own tests did tests start to pick up in March and April.

A more recent hold-up has been nasal swabs. These are actually more technical than might seem at first. Given that they’re stuck deep into a person’s nasal cavity, they have to be high quality — to make sure they don’t break off while they’re in there. Manufacturers can’t just use any materials either; some components can fail to pick up enough of a sample, or even ruin or dilute a sample.

Chapin gave an example of a cotton swab on a wooden stick: “It ends up that the cotton swab is inhibitory to some [kinds of tests], and then the wooden stick has some fluorescent components to it, which is the same fluorescence that we use to detect the virus. So in one sense, you may get a false negative, because the swab material inhibits being able to detect the virus, and in one sense you may get a false positive, because of the components of the stick.”

Only a few manufacturers can produce the necessary swabs, and they were set up to make only so many — certainly not enough to meet rising global demand as the coronavirus spreads. As Baird said, “Do you think the factory right now that makes 10,000 of those a day can all of a sudden make 10 million of them?”

Swabs are only one example, with problems also popping up with other tools needed to collect samples, personal protective equipment for staff, vials and other equipment to store the samples as they’re transported and tested, some testing platforms (particularly for rapid testing), and the reagents used to isolate, amplify, and otherwise probe a sample for the coronavirus. Which supply shortage is a bottleneck in the chain in a given moment can vary depending on the time and place.

It’s these issues, along with sometimes strict rules over who can get tested, that have led to unused capacity in some labs, including Baird’s. When a lab says it has unused capacity, it’s typically speaking to how many tests its machines and platforms could theoretically process each day. But to actually conduct those tests, the lab first needs the staff, samples, reagents to run those samples, and everything in-between.

Testing is necessary to ease social distancing

It has been stated thousands of times throughout the pandemic, but it remains as true as ever: More testing is needed to fight the coronavirus and ease social distancing. Every major proposal for ending the pandemic puts testing at the center.

It’s not just about learning the scope of the pandemic, but about using that knowledge to take specific actions. Testing gives officials the means to isolate sick people, track, and quarantine the people whom those verified to be sick came into close contact with (a.k.a. contact tracing), and deploy community-wide efforts if a new cluster of cases is too large and uncontrolled otherwise.

Contact tracing is a big part of that. A report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Association of State and Territorial Health estimates the US will need to hire 100,000 contact tracers — far above what states and federal officials have so far said they’re hiring. A phone app could help mitigate the need for quite as many tracers, but Americans may not have the appetite for an app that will effectively track their every move.

If done correctly, countries like South Korea and Germany have shown that testing and contact tracing can help control the spread of Covid-19.

It’s not a cure-all. All the major plans still acknowledge that some level of social distancing will be necessary until a vaccine or other major medical breakthrough is available, perhaps a year or more from now; maybe expect that you’ll be able to visit friends and family in their homes, but not pack movie theaters, concerts, sports stadiums, or some restaurants. And places will likely have to tighten social distancing here and there as outbreaks flare up again, as Germany is considering despite its success so far.

But testing would allow a better situation than our current one — and it’s a necessary bridge to really diminish the danger of the coronavirus.

The labs that have been able to overcome many of these problems acted early on in the outbreak and diversified their tests. According to Chapin, her lab in Rhode Island, which currently conducts more tests per person than any other state, was able to scale up testing in part because it started to stock up on supplies in February. It also maintains a diversity in testing platforms, so it can still run other tests if, for example, one platform breaks down or faces supply issues due to a manufacturing glitch (as already happened).

But individual labs can only go so far. They can’t do much about a nasal swab factory not having the employees it needs to manufacture enough swabs, a reagent producer not having the materials it needs, or a hospital not having the protective equipment to safely collect samples. All of these actors — and more — have to simultaneously work together on their own.

It’s this level of fragmentation, experts say, that necessitates proactive coordination from the federal government to predict, detect, and fix supply problems that can pop up across the US and the globe. Besides the federal government, no other entity — not manufacturers, labs, or cities and states — can properly oversee the full line of production that’s needed.

The good news is that the work of addressing supply bottlenecks should be relatively straightforward. “This is supply chain 101. This is operations 101,” Nada Sanders, a supply chain management expert at Northeastern University, told me. “It’s so simple. And it’s just not happening.”

So far, though, there’s little sign of that changing — and Trump has suggested that it’s on the states and the private sector instead. That leaves the fragmentation along the supply chain in place, making it unclear how, when, or if testing problems will get fixed and when the US will be able to safely relax social distancing.

“The whole point of this social distancing is to buy us time to build up capacity to do the types of public health interventions we know work,” Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida, previously told me. “If we’re not using this time to scale up testing to the level that we need it to be … we don’t have an exit strategy. And then when we lift things, we’re no better equipped than we were before.”

"['Aaron Rupar', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Trump won’t stop saying the 1918 flu pandemic happened in 1917,"On each of the last four days, President Donald Trump has lamented that the coronavirus pandemic is the worst the world has seen since 1917. There’s just one problem — the flu pandemic he’s referring to actually began in 1918.

This may seem like a little thing, and in a universe of Trump falsehood featuring claims about much more consequential matters such as climate change and voter fraud, it is. But since the lessons from how governments handled the 1918 pandemic that are relevant to the coronavirus, Trump’s ignorance, in this case, has a significance beyond illustrating a shaky grasp of details — that some of his falsehoods are utterly impervious to correction.

“Who would think you could have a stock market at 24,000 after we’ve gone through the worst pandemic since 1917? That’s over 100 years,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding Thursday: “Tremendous death. It was just a terrible thing, the likes of which we haven’t seen I guess if you go back over 100 years, 1917. And that was a terrible thing.”

Trump still hasn't figured out that the 1918 flu pandemic didn't happen in 1917 pic.twitter.com/7FQGlT9O9Z — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 30, 2020

This didn’t just start this week. Trump has been regularly claiming that the 1918 flu pandemic started in 1917 since he started holding coronavirus-related press briefings in March.

“Nobody’s seen this I would say since 1917, which was the greatest of them all, the greatest of this type of battle,” Trump said on April 4. “Right? 1917.”

Trump keeps saying that the 1918 flu pandemic happened in 1917, which is wrong pic.twitter.com/7o4zNAEWnC — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 4, 2020

According to a tally compiled by Susan Glasser of the New Yorker, Trump has incorrectly referred to a 1917 flu pandemic at least 27 times since March 11. As she noted:

In a handful of instances—six, by my count—Trump referred to both 1917 and 1918, suggesting that someone had perhaps tried to give him the correct date, but he could never quite get it to stick.

The ironic thing is that if anybody should be able to get the date right, it should be Trump. His grandfather, Friedrich Trump, died in New York City in 1918 from the flu during the early stages of a pandemic that killed about 675,000 Americans. Nonetheless, Trump, seemingly unaware of his family’s history, said in March, “Does anybody die from the flu? I didn’t know people died from the flu.”

Given that he makes the same false claim just about every day (and, as was the case on Wednesday, more than once a day), you’d think one of Trump’s advisers would try to correct him. Maybe they have and it just hasn’t stuck. Whatever the case, Trump just can’t seem to get it right.

Trump has a notoriously shaky grasp of history. Recall, for instance, how during one of his first public events as president he described Frederick Douglass, who died in 1895, as “an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job that is being recognized more and more, I notice,” or how he regularly expresses surprise more people aren’t aware that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.

While it could be argued that these gaffes are trivial, the 1918 pandemic actually offers some important lessons for governments struggling to handle the coronavirus.

As my colleague German Lopez has detailed, perhaps the most important lesson is that moving away from social distancing too soon is a grave mistake.

“Studies show that the social distancing efforts helped slow the spread of the 1918 flu and reduce the mortality rate overall,” Lopez wrote. “In city after city during the 1918 flu pandemic, giving up on such measures early consistently caused flu cases and deaths to rise again.”

But even as the daily number of new, confirmed cases in the US in April plateaued instead of declined, Trump is pushing for businesses and schools to reopen.

“I think what happens is it’s going to go away,” Trump said of the coronavirus on Wednesday, even though studies about the 1918 pandemic indicate that if he has his way and businesses reopen before the virus is under control, cases will spike.

As George Santayana once wrote, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

"['Ella Nilsen', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Poll: Most freelance workers still haven’t gotten unemployment or government loans,"Laid-off Americans are signing up for unemployment benefits by the tens of millions. But new data suggests freelancers — a group that constitutes about a third of the US workforce — are not seeing much relief.

A new survey done by the Freelancers Union of 2,755 of its members found a full 85 percent who applied for government relief still have not received the funding, and the vast majority were still waiting to hear back from government relief programs.

The CARES Act contained a new program for freelancers and those who are self-employed, known as Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA). Freelancers and independent contractors, previously excluded from these programs, now qualify through the end of July — and possibly beyond if Congress extends the program.

But the survey from the Freelancers Union suggests that very few applicants have actually gotten economic help from the government.

“The numbers show the dire reality that freelancers are facing,” Freelancers Union president Rafael Espinal told Vox in an interview Thursday. “To this day, I would say the overwhelming majority of freelance workers have not seen a dollar, and the CARES act has not been working in their favor.”

Espinal’s union surveyed its members and found that 82 percent have applied for one or more government relief programs due to the coronavirus pandemic; the overwhelming number of those have been unemployment benefits, but 36 percent of freelancers applied for the Paycheck Protection Program small business loans, and another 39 percent applied for Economic Injury Disaster Loans.

Of the large number of survey respondents who haven’t yet received relief, 80 percent are waiting to hear back, and 22 percent have been denied funding. Just 12 percent of these freelancers who applied for unemployment insurance received it, 5 percent of PPP loan applicants received funding, and 9 percent of those who applied for an EIDL loan received it.

A big reason freelancers are waiting so long to get their money is that states are still setting up Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs to help them. Unlike simply throwing more money at their existing unemployment insurance programs, many states have had to build new programs from scratch to help freelancers and independent contractors. Some of those programs are already accepting applications and preparing to send out checks while others are still being built.

Washington, Massachusetts, Georgia, and Alabama are among the states already accepting PUA applications, but many other states haven’t yet announced the dates for when they’ll have their program set up and ready for workers to file. Ohio and Arizona, for instance, announced their programs won’t be ready until mid-May, and many more states are telling workers to keep checking back for more information.

“It feels like the federal and state governments are trying to fly the plane while they’re building it, and that has created a lot of confusion and frustration for freelance workers,” Espinal said.

How to access Pandemic Unemployment Assistance self-employed, freelancers, or independent contractors

The best way to find out how to apply for your state’s PUA program — what the status of it is — is to visit your state’s unemployment website.

The application process for PUA programs is more complicated than for those who have been laid off or furloughed from an employer and who are eligible for regular unemployment insurance.

Keeping documentation about your previous income and wages as a freelancer, independent contractor, or self-employed worker is important and will help you when filing for unemployment. Keep documentation both about how you get your money and how much you have been paid per month in the past (old tax returns and invoices are good examples).

“Whatever documentation they have about how they get their money would be helpful,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. If people are lacking documentation, they can file good-faith attestations about their wages to unemployment offices, but documents are preferred.

"['Ezra Klein', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,What should the media learn from the coronavirus?,"The coronavirus is “a nightmare scenario” for the media, wrote New York Times columnist Charlie Warzel. “It is stealthy, resilient and confounding to experts. It moves far faster than scientists can study it. What seems to be true today may be wrong tomorrow.”

Warzel is right. We’ve talked a lot in recent years about fake news. But combating information we know is false is a straightforward problem compared to covering a story where we don’t know what’s true, and where yesterday’s expert consensus becomes tomorrow’s derided falsehoods. In these cases, the normal tools of journalism begin to fail, and trust is easily lost.

There’s been a lot of criticism of what the media missed in the run-up to the coronavirus. Some of it has been unfair. But some of it demands attention, reflection, and change. There’s also a lot the media got right, and those successes need to be celebrated and learned from.

The questions raised in this interview are hard, and go to one of the trickiest issues in journalism: How does a profession that prides itself on reporting truth cover the world probabilistically? What do we do when we simply can’t know what’s true, and when some of what we think we know might become untrue?

Warzel covers the way technology, information, and media interact with and change each other. He’s one of the people I turn to first when I’m churning over these questions, which is … not infrequent. And so this episode of The Ezra Klein Show is a bit different than the normal fare: This is less an interview-with-an-expert, and more the kind of conversation that I — and others in the media — am having a lot of right now, and that I think we at least need to try and have in public.

Here’s a lightly edited transcript of part of our conversation, which we released this week on The Ezra Klein Show.

Ezra Klein

You wrote that “the coronavirus emerges in the middle of a golden age of media manipulation. It’s resilient and stealthy and confounding to experts. And it moves faster than scientists can study it: what seems true today can be wrong tomorrow.”

It’s the worst possible situation for the media because the way you might normally do your reporting begins to break down, and what you somehow need to be doing is probabilistic reporting. But we don’t really have good models for that, so it creates a trust crisis.

I think face masks are a good example because that’s somewhere where all kinds of media organizations were talking to the CDC and the US surgeon general and everybody said: Face masks are not that effective, they’re more trouble than they’re worth, we should save them for nurses and others. Then, midway through this crisis, they reversed that guidance to some degree. That’s a real problem for the media because we were trying to be accurate and what we were being told wasn’t accurate. Nobody wants to second guess the CDC on face masks, but that stuff does real damage in the long run to people’s faith in us.

Charlie Warzel

I think it’s true. A month ago, there’s the sort of unthinkable moment where the American health care system looks like it might possibly explode. And there was this real backlash against the media — and it was founded.

I did a lot of soul searching in that moment as someone who covers technology, media, politics. I’ve never been a science reporter or someone who’s covered infectious diseases. But should I have seen this coming in some way? Should I have been paying more attention to this global issue, or to global issues in general? Should I always be paying 10 percent more attention to what is happening in China? And, if so, how would that have informed the way that I would have thought about this crisis in January and early February — before it really became real to me as the biggest story in the world?

I think you’re right to focus on [face masks] because I don’t know what the answer is there. The type of reporting that anyone would do is to reach out to the government experts — to speak to the people who are in these positions of authority. If that system breaks down, I don’t know what we’re really supposed to do.

There’s no good answer here, but I think this idea of probabilistic reporting is somewhere along the lines. The thing I’ve noticed from a media perspective is that there is sort of a realm of certainty around the framing of a story where you’re saying, “You don’t need to worry.” It’s framed and couched in an overly assured tone.

I think that when it comes to reporting on science or infectious disease — or probably even politics — the media needs to move a little bit toward embracing uncertainty. People want answers but they also want to be leveled with right now. I think generally that’s how a sophisticated news consumption audience wants to be treated. Part of what we need to do is embrace some of that uncertainty and say, “here’s what we know; here’s what we don’t know.” We need to be a lot more vigilant about foregrounding what we don’t know.

Ezra Klein

In February, Dr. Anthony Fauci was still saying the risk from the coronavirus to the US was “minuscule.” We assumed that the people we were talking to really knew what was going on. Maybe we should have been more skeptical and said we just don’t know that much here. On the other hand, it’s really hard as a reporter to question what the five epidemiologists you just called are telling you.

Reporters deal all the time with stories that could become something huge — viruses that could become the next global pandemic or financial issues that could become the next financial crisis — and most of them don’t. You become somewhat used to talking things down because you don’t want to constantly seem like the news organization crying wolf. But if you’re used to talking things down, and everything has a 5 percent or 2 percent or 1 percent probability of becoming the worst thing ever, then eventually you’re going to roll snake eyes.

This is something I am really struggling with. I keep thinking about how do I cover things more probabilistically without somehow substituting expertise for things I don’t actually have expertise in.

Charlie Warzel

I think that this is going to be a moment in a lot of our lives that will change the way in which we think about risk and resiliency, especially in industries like ours where there is either a future casting element or an assessment of risk and severity that we’re constantly making. I think some of the problem here has to do with the fact that we haven’t had a pandemic like this in a lifetime of people. There aren’t a lot of people alive who went through 1918 to loudly ring an alarm bell.

If you’re somebody who is constantly assessing risk and resiliency and thinking about the interconnected ways in which our systems work globally and are reliant on each other, then you might have rung the alarm bell a little bit earlier. I actually think that’s a reason why a lot of people in Silicon Valley are some of the people who took it really seriously early. You had some venture capitalists in the valley who banned handshakes [in early February].

Those types of people are always assessing the probability of 1 or 2 percent and the type of returns you can get from that. That’s the tech investor strategy. But that’s not necessarily the way you would want the press to act.

I think a lot about the idea that we’re also competing within information ecosystems. You’re competing for attention and eyeballs, and it’s very difficult to turn probabilistic, incredibly hedged, nuanced ideas into something that can get in front of people. It’s always been in our nature, in the press to get important work out to people. And sometimes [to do that] you have to frame things in a way that couches some of the nuance.

That’s a long way of saying, I think that we should constantly be reckoning, as people of the press, with what we’re doing right and wrong.

"['Sigal Samuel', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,It’s okay to be doing okay during the pandemic,"We’re all struggling, to some degree, to adjust to life during the novel coronavirus pandemic. But some are struggling far more than others. People who have contracted Covid-19, who have lost loved ones to the disease, who are working on the front lines to keep others healthy, who don’t have enough food or a safe place to live — these are people who are bearing the brunt of the suffering right now.

If you’re not one of these people, you may feel a great deal of gratitude — and maybe a bit of guilt. It can feel uncomfortable, even shameful, to be enjoying good takeout and fun TV shows under a cozy blanket in a nice home when you know millions of others are experiencing the greatest hardship of their lives.

The trouble with guilt is that it’s often counterproductive. It can make us feel overwhelmed and paralyzed. In that state, it’s hard for us to actually help anybody. We’re not able to be useful to other people or reduce their suffering, because we ourselves are suffering from an emotion that we’ve allowed to ensnare us.

Perhaps there’s comfort in remembering that we’re not the first human beings to grapple with this problem. Many thinkers have contemplated it over the millennia and left us with rich wisdom and traditions to help us navigate it. As I’ve spoken to mindfulness teachers during the pandemic, there’s one Buddhist teaching I’ve found particularly helpful. It’s found in a discourse called the Sallatha Sutta, also known as “The Arrow.” Maybe you’ll find it helpful, too.

The Buddha taught that when we experience something painful — a physical illness, or the news that someone we love has died, or witnessing suffering all around us — it’s as if the world has shot an arrow into us. It hurts! That pain is totally normal, and it’s fine to acknowledge it. In fact, it’s good to acknowledge it, to let ourselves simply be with the experience of pain.

But often, what we then do is shoot a second arrow into ourselves. That second arrow is any thought we use to spin up a “story” around our pain, as a way of resisting simply being with the experience of pain. This can manifest in many different ways.

It can take the form of shame: “I’m such a weak person, to be crying out like this!” Or anger: “How dare the doctors not save my loved one’s life! They’re so incompetent!” Or ruminating: “If only I’d nudged my loved one to take this or that extra precaution, maybe they wouldn’t have died.” Or catastrophizing: “I’m going to die, too!” Or guilt: “I don’t deserve to live while other people are dying.”

We’ve all got our second arrow of choice. Whichever one you incline toward, the key thing to bear in mind is that it’s self-inflicted, which is to say, it’s optional. It might not seem that way, because it comes upon you so quickly that it seems automatic, but the Buddhist teaching insists this is a second arrow we shoot into ourselves. And doing so is what causes us suffering. As many Buddhist mindfulness teachers like to say: Suffering = Pain x Resistance.

The Buddha, in the Sallatha Sutta, teaches that there’s another way.

The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones, when touched with a feeling of pain, does not sorrow, grieve, or lament, does not beat his breast or become distraught. So he feels one pain: physical, but not mental. Just as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and, right afterward, did not shoot him with another one, so that he would feel the pain of only one arrow. … As he is touched by that painful feeling, he is not resistant.

In other words, if we can be brave enough to sit with the original painful feeling (the first arrow) even though that feels hard and scary, we can avoid spinning up a narrative around that feeling that will cause us to suffer (the second arrow). Unburdened by guilt, we can be more productive and proactive and actually be effective actors in trying to ease suffering. Taking care of our own emotions can make us better at helping others.

How to apply this Buddhist teaching during the pandemic

It’s one thing to understand a teaching intellectually, quite another to know how to apply it. To help us understand how we can actually use the teaching of the second arrow in our current moment, I called up Rhonda Magee, a mindfulness teacher with a focus on social and racial justice.

“This teaching is part of the core curriculum of traditional Buddhism,” she said. “It isn’t a program for how to transcend difficulty. It’s a program for how to be more and more open to the vast amount of difficulty that can show up in life … and engage more skillfully with all that.”

When I asked what I should do if I’m feeling guilt — for example, after reading that Covid-19 is disproportionately taking black lives — she recommended using a practice called RAIN, which has been popularized by contemporary meditation teachers like Tara Brach. The acronym stands for recognize, allow, investigate, nurture. Here’s how Magee suggested moving through the process.

Recognize that a first arrow has hit you — a piece of news has caused you pain — and, if possible, just sit with that rather than immediately shooting yourself with the second arrow of guilt. If you’re already feeling guilt, recognize it’s arisen in reaction to this piece of news.

Accept what is happening. Let yourself fully feel in the body what sensations and emotions are arising when you receive that piece of news. Notice them and name them, without getting caught up in them.

Then investigate the emotions. “Unpack the guilt,” Magee said. “Guilt in and of itself isn’t a bad thing. The question to look at is: Is this neurotic guilt, where it’s not really about something I’ve done, but I’m taking on more than my appropriate share of responsibility? Or is this feeling of guilt [arising because] I’m living in a way that’s not aligned with my values? Have I personally acted in a way that misses my own ethical mark? Is this trying to tell me something I need to know about how I’ve structured my life?”

Magee also noted that sometimes wallowing in guilt is a way of letting ourselves off the hook. “If I say, ‘Oh, I’m so privileged, but there’s nothing I can do about it because it’s systemic’ — is that me avoiding having to do something different and take action?” It’s worth investigating that, too.

Finally, you want to nurture yourself, maybe by journaling, calling a friend, or saying something soothing to yourself. Then, crucially, you also want to nurture others. That could mean contacting a mutual aid group to ask about volunteer opportunities or making a donation to an effective charity or working with your community to get good officials elected.

“Try to take some action, without getting attached to the outcome,” Magee said. “Take mindfulness from being just a personal liberation practice to [being about] how we might minimize the arrows that are hitting the more vulnerable because of the ways we’ve structured our society.”

Bottom line: If you’re doing fine during the pandemic, there’s no sense in wallowing in guilt over it. Your guilt doesn’t actually help anyone; it just adds more suffering to the world. Instead, you can see it as an indication that you’re well-resourced enough to be able to give more to others — and then go do that.

The art of suffering with others: Becoming a bodhisattva and following the Middle Way

There’s something comforting about knowing that people have grappled with the same questions we’re facing — whether and how to suffer with others — for millennia and have left us their best wisdom.

The Mahayana branch of Buddhism, which has a rich tradition of thinking through these questions, includes the notion of a bodhisattva: a person who’s able to attain enlightenment but who holds off on it because they want to help other beings who are still suffering.

Any one of us has the potential to become a bodhisattva, but it requires a lot of compassion and selflessness. You have to be willing to postpone your own ultimate well-being, your own nirvana, in order to help others along the path to their well-being.

“We have to ask ourselves: Are we willing to suffer a bit more?” Magee told me. “We are being willing to suffer with others, to a degree, in those moments when we extend ourselves with compassion.”

Note that the point here is not that we should unthinkingly let ourselves get caught up in second-arrow suffering, which we inflict upon ourselves but which doesn’t actually help anybody. As mentioned above, that’s just adding more suffering to the world, which is counterproductive. Instead, the idea is that we can make a mindful choice to hold off on some of our own gratification in service of helping many others suffer less.

But there’s a trap here we’ve got to watch out for. “If you’re constantly trying to become a bodhisattva, that’s clinging to another story,” Magee warned. In other words, if you’re dead-set on the goal of rescuing all other beings, you’re spinning up a narrative and becoming attached to a certain idea of yourself — you’re making the self the object of what you’re trying to do. This might even lead you to do damage: You may feel like you need to give away everything you’ve got to those who are less fortunate until you yourself become ill.

The Buddhist teaching of the Middle Way cautions against this showy breed of asceticism. It insists that we should avoid the extremes of both self-denial and self-indulgence.

“That teaching is there to help us be a human being doing the best we can to confront suffering we see,” Magee said, “while knowing that there’s a temptation to come up with a new story of ‘No, but you need to do more! If you really want to help, why are you stopping there? Do more!’”

At the end of the day, she said, we need to find balance: helping ourselves while also helping others. Neither is good without the other. In fact, knowing how to do the former can make us better at the latter.

As Magee put it, “Taking care of ourselves is the first approximation of mindful compassion.”

Vox has evolved and will continue to evolve as it builds a portfolio of modern editorial networks and partners across multiple mediums driving the future of journalism and entertainment. However, our commitment to the core values of integrity and passion will never change.

We believe in working with talented people, the judgment of our staff, and the transcendent importance of serving the interests of our audiences. Through the Vox Media editorial guidelines we aim to give our teams clear guidance about what to avoid and the public knowledge of what to expect. Simultaneously, we recognize the impossibility of reducing the complexity of real life to a simple checklist or rulebook and encourage conversation and dialogue with colleagues and supervisors about concrete situations as superior to trying to craft an ethics policy that would address every conceivable dilemma.

As the needs of our newsrooms and audiences change, our guidelines will adapt in kind to ensure that Vox Media’s work is always deserving of our audiences’ trust.

Advertising and Revenue Partnerships

Vox Media is home to editorial networks and the businesses that enable them. In no case, however, do these efforts interfere with the integrity of our editorial teams or the content they create.

This includes Vox Media divisions responsible for selling advertising and editorial sponsorships on our properties; advertising across the publisher-led marketplace Concert; branded content created in partnership with our in-house advertising practice Vox Creative; and podcast advertising across the Vox Media Podcast Network. In each case, the work of these independent groups is clearly marked or announced as “Advertiser Content” or “Presented by” a sponsor as applicable.

Some of our content contains affiliate links, which means we will receive a commission for purchases made via those links; when our editorial or commerce teams have manually added affiliate links to our articles, we will include a disclosure within the content.

Advertisements do not necessarily reflect the views of Vox Media or our editorial teams.

Conflicts of Interest, Activism and Disclosures

Vox Media’s newsrooms have complete editorial independence and our editorial staff and contributors take their beats seriously. Any editorial team member or contributors will be recused from a story and/or publicly disclose conflicts of interest when editorially appropriate. This may include a personal or family relationship, personal financial investment, or relevant political activity. Our staff will also refrain from demonstrating or donating to causes that could compromise their journalistic coverage of an issue.

Vox Media also has a number of investors, which are publicly disclosed here.

Corrections, Updates and Deletions

Vox Media makes every effort for content to be completely accurate upon publication. If a correction is required, however, we are transparent and update a story if new information either adds to or invalidates the original story. We will issue corrections for a factual error or if a typo in the copy could cause audiences to misunderstand the story.

We almost always leave all editorial content live, with notes and corrections as needed. We may, in rare instances, remove content from our websites, social media pages, or related platforms for legal reasons or extenuating circumstances. Removal will never be at the direction of, or be influenced by, our advertisers and will always be approved by editorial leadership.

Some Vox Media editorial networks accept financial contributions from individual audience members and funding from grant organizations. However, this financial support does not affect editorial independence.

Gifts and Giveaways

We do not accept gifts or other consideration from companies as a condition or incentive to write a review or story, whether favorable or unfavorable. Any gifts accepted will be of minor value and in no way compromises or guarantees editorial coverage of the event, product, or service.

Occasionally, Vox Media will conduct contests and giveaways for our audiences. We will post rules for each contest and giveaway that will be binding for those who decide to participate. While giveaways or contests may be sponsored by an advertiser or partner, they are not, and should never be, considered endorsements of the entities involved or their products.

Social Media

Vox Media hires our editorial employees for their strong, expert voices, and values their ability to build positive communities and influence on our platforms and their own. We implore all staff to wield their tool/voice with extra care. Behavior on social media is a reflection of both one’s personal and professional self and, as a voice of Vox Media and our editorial networks, we expect social posts to apply the same journalistic integrity required in our editorial content.

Note: our editorial guidelines leave no room for indulging harassment on social media. All Vox Media employees are encouraged to access and review our protocol for reporting online abuse.

Sourcing

Vox Media obtains news and content from a variety of sources. Some of our sources do not wish to be named, and we grant anonymity when we know our sources to be credible and reliable, and that their story would otherwise not be told. We make best efforts to confirm the veracity of the information provided by anonymous sources and will not include any information we have not thoroughly vetted. It is our policy not to pay sources.

"['Fabiola Cineas', 'May']",2020-05-01,A bioethicist on why reopening states will kill more black people,"As of April 28, the United States surpassed 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases. But this hasn’t stopped more than half of US states from partially reopening or making plans to reopen soon. Prematurely restarting businesses means that new virus cases will arise, health officials say, especially in the face of insufficient testing. This puts the country’s most vulnerable populations — black, Latinx, poor, elderly, disabled — at greater risk of infection and death.

For the black community, the decision to reopen — despite the alarming data that shows they are disproportionately suffering from the disease (black people make up 30 percent of coronavirus cases, according to the CDC, even though they represent just 13 percent of the US population) — fuels the community’s distrust of government and health leadership. It harks back to cruel historical practices that used black bodies as scientific Silly Putty.

The event most cited to explain the historical distrust is the US Public Health Service’s (PHS) syphilis study at the Tuskegee Institute, which began in 1932 and continued for 40 years, until it was exposed as ethically unjustified. The study tracked 399 black men in rural Macon County, Alabama, who had syphilis and another 201 who were supposedly in a control group. PHS never informed the participants that they had the disease and simply told the men they would be treated for “bad blood,” a catchall phrase for various illnesses. Ultimately, the federal government would surveil the men to determine syphilis’s impact on the body’s organ systems when left untreated.

As the director of Tuskegee University’s National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care, Reuben C. Warren knows this history all too well. According to Warren, PHS fractured the relationship between the federal government and the black community by lying and withholding treatment — and marring Tuskegee’s history in the process, an institution founded by the renowned black educator Booker T. Washington for the academic and vocational training of black professionals. In 1997, decades after the study was exposed, Warren, then the associate director of minority health at the CDC, a position he held for 20 years, was part of a coalition of scientists and public health officials that called on President Bill Clinton for an apology. Following the apology, the federal government, at the coalition’s request, established the center that Warren now heads to ensure that a project like the syphilis study wouldn’t happen again.

Warren says that at this moment in the coronavirus pandemic, governors are now choosing “who shall live” by reopening states, drawing parallels to moments like the Tuskegee syphilis study. Warren explains why this is a matter of ethics and a false choice between health and economics, as the issue of black distrust only worsens. (Our interview has been edited and condensed.)

When you first heard about the novel coronavirus, particularly about how it was taking the lives of black people at a disproportionate rate, what was your initial reaction?

Reuben C. Warren

My initial reaction was: “more of the same.” I was not surprised. Nor was I surprised that initially public health officials and political officials did not want to collect race and ethnicity data because they knew what data would tell them. You count what you think is important, and you ignore what you don’t think is important. They refused to do something until the demand to collect data grew.

Many people will say black people have a disproportionate burden of disease, like heart disease and diabetes. All that’s true, but the current challenge is black and Hispanic folks continue to be at risk. They are the workers. They are the ones who are not getting PPE. They are the ones who can’t afford to stay home. In “The African American Petri Dish,” my colleague Ronald Braithwaite of the Morehouse School of Medicine and I discuss how African Americans are in high-exposure petri dish positions since they are often the front-line workers and this presents a greater challenge.

So we don’t want to get sidelined focusing on the historical issue of health disparities, which is important, but if you look back to move forward, the current conditions we face are worsening the problem.

Fabiola Cineas

What are your takeaways now, based on how you see the coronavirus impacting the black community? What does this all mean for the black community?

Reuben C. Warren

The takeaway is devastation, because we know better but we’re not doing better, especially when it comes to testing. Testing is important, but it has to be not only for those who show “signs” of infection. We know now that people can be asymptomatic. To test only those who have signs is a naïve-at-best, intentional-at-worst effort to not acknowledge the depth and breadth of the coronavirus.

We already know that without testing it is going to disproportionately impact people who are at greatest risk, particularly African American and Hispanic Americans. Then equally as important are the isolation and the follow-up. This is a challenge and accessing health care is a challenge. Black people disproportionately lack access to health care and primary care doctors. So then there’s this fear of going to the emergency room. This problem is worsening.

Fabiola Cineas

Outside of Tuskegee, what else can you point to to explain black mistrust of the medical community? And how do you see it playing out now?

Reuben C. Warren

It’s rampant. You might have heard the name J. Marion Sims, who is the “father of gynecology.” In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Sims tested vascular surgical techniques on enslaved black women — without anesthesia. He tested and retested them like this — and he’s the “father of gynecology”! He even published an article on these women.

There is a study from the early 2000s called “Unequal Treatment: [Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care]” where scientists looked at health care delivery and found that there was a disparate difference between the quality of care given to blacks and whites, even with the same economic status.

“You count what you think is important, and you ignore what you don’t think is important”

Then there’s the other classic, the 1985 “Report of the Secretary’s Task Force on Black and Minority Health.” This documents 60,000 excess deaths in the black population each year, “excess deaths” being using the death rate of the white population and comparing it to the death rate of the black population. There were 60,000 excess deaths each year due to six causes: cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, unintentional injuries, and infant mortality. And then in 1992, HIV and AIDS became the seventh. Then in 2002, David Satcher, the former Surgeon General, did this analysis again and found that the excess deaths had increased to about 83,000.

So, today, the problem is clear. We need not revisit the problem again and again. Let us move toward doing what we know can ameliorate the problem. Let’s prioritize resources based upon need, not based upon politics. Consistently, the black population demonstrates the greatest disparity; therefore, it’s where the greatest resources are to be committed. But it’s not happening.

Fabiola Cineas

Georgia, a state where black people are disproportionately infected with and dying from Covid-19, has reopened during the pandemic despite expert advice that says stay-at-home measures should remain in place. What parallels do you see between this move and what has happened historically?

Reuben C. Warren

The vulnerability is clear. There’s a 1974 book by [economist] Victor R. Fuchs titled Who Shall Live? Health, Economics, and Social Choice. Like the title of the book, we have to decide who shall live. The historical record and the current practices suggest something very scary. Some folks who happen to be in power will have to decide who shall live.

There’s a notion called herd immunity, and that’s what they’re doing in Sweden. There are people going about their normal day-to-day with no social distancing. They’ve just accepted that a certain percentage of the population is going to die. But Sweden has a very different demographic than the United States. Those who are at greatest risk here are people of color. They are the most vulnerable to live and also the most likely to die, regardless of income, education. Across any demographic, the black population disproportionately suffers.

Right now, the messengers don’t look like those who need to hear the message.

The country asks for trust, and I would argue that until those leaders at whatever level demonstrate trustworthiness, trust will not be forthcoming. Shift the paradigm from those who are most vulnerable to those who have the most power and authority. Trustworthiness is the framework, not trust.

Fabiola Cineas

Is it ethical for these states to open up now during the pandemic?

Reuben C. Warren

No. I think it is a priority of health over economics. The decision is that clear — there’s no either/or. Health is the priority. Public health ethics is based upon the population as opposed to the individuals, and to resolve public health issues, we look to three constructs.

The first is community engagement. The second construct is not benevolence but beneficence — what are your intentions and what are you going to do? The third is social justice, doing what’s in the best interest of the population at the greatest risk. It’s not the whole population, as that would instead be the utilitarian principle or the happiness principle for the greatest good but at the expense of those who are suffering.

That utilitarian principle does not work in a diverse population particularly when subsets of the population have been historically disadvantaged and abused. And bioethics does not work in this construct. It is a valuable principle, framework, and concept, but it doesn’t work in population-based challenges. This is a public health challenge, and the response and the resolve have to be embedded in public health ethics.

Fabiola Cineas

Thinking about what ultimately happened to the men in the PHS syphilis study at Tuskegee, what are your final thoughts about how the coronavirus is playing out in black communities today?

Reuben C. Warren

Yes, some of the men died from diseases and conditions associated with syphilis. Some survived. And some suffered throughout the process — from the disease, if you will, but also from the horror, the embarrassment, the disgrace. And not only the men but also the families. A granddaughter of one of the men said she was called the syphilis kid in school. The emotional trauma is yet to be fully realized. There’s community trauma, and we have to acknowledge they’re moving from blame and shame to honor and glory. That’s a journey. We’re on the way, but we’re not fully there yet.

I see the same thing now, in focusing on the disease but not focusing on the condition and the vulnerability as a result of the disease. We don’t know enough, but we know enough to do better. To not test broader is unconscionable. If we don’t recognize and acknowledge history and its truth, then we are bound to repeat it.

"['Anna North', 'Apr']",2020-04-30,The “women’s work” of the pandemic,"Megan Piontkowski started with a batch of 32. A freelance artist and illustrator out of work due to the pandemic, she found out through a friend that a Brooklyn hospital needed fabric masks for workers amid a shortage of personal protective equipment. Piontkowski already had some fabric on hand and a sewing machine she’d used for her art, so she got to work.

She washed the fabric, stitched masks, washed them again, and hung them to dry while wearing a mask herself, then drove them to the hospital. She went through the whole process twice, donating the materials and about 35 hours of her time. She asked if the hospital would pay for the masks, but was told they had no money.

“I felt very mixed about it,” she told Vox. She knew the hospital needed masks badly. But at the same time, “I’m out of work and I’m being asked to donate them.”

The fact that she wasn’t compensated for sewing highly necessary items felt like a case of “traditional ‘women’s work’ not being valued,” Piontkowski said.

While larger companies have begun mass-producing cloth masks in recent weeks, much of the work of making the protective garments, especially in the early stages of the pandemic, was done at home — often by women. That gender breakdown is continuing in some volunteer efforts — about 85 percent of the around 70 volunteers sewing masks for the New York City-based group Face Mask Aid, for example, are women. A search of Facebook reveals multiple groups for moms who want to make masks — but no clearly comparable groups for dads.

And masks are only part of the story. The demands of daily life during the coronavirus pandemic are many, from shopping for food amid shortages and virus fears to caring for children when schools and day cares are closed. And in many cases, women are the ones figuring out how to meet those new demands. Women are “describing feeling an inordinate amount of expectations that have been placed on their shoulders in this pandemic,” Sinikka Elliott, a sociology professor at the University of British Columbia and a co-author of the book Pressure Cooker: Why Home Cooking Won’t Solve Our Problems and What We Can Do About It, told Vox.

For some, those expectations can include making masks for family, friends, or front-line workers. Others are trying to take care of kids and manage their online school schedules — tasks that, experts say, are likely to fall disproportionately to women in many households. Others still are working outside the home as essential workers but shouldering care responsibilities when they get home.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Some say the pandemic, with more men working from home and seeing firsthand the labor that goes into tasks like cooking and educating children, has the potential to reset gender norms. “The pandemic is potentially sparking new conversations about divisions of labor,” Jill Yavorsky, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, told Vox.

But those conversations will only happen on a national scale if we actually pay attention to the people doing the sewing, cooking, and child care right now and value their work accordingly.

Many of the people making protective masks for others right now are women

The history of mask-wearing in the US during the coronavirus pandemic is already a complex one. As the virus spread around the world in February and March, US officials told Americans that healthy people did not need to wear masks in public. But in April, the CDC began recommending that everyone wear a cloth mask in certain public settings, and some places, like New York State, made mask-wearing mandatory.

By early April, however, millions of Americans were living under shelter-in-place orders and told to limit trips outside the home. On April 4, the White House warned Americans to try to avoid even the grocery store. There was also a nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment that made masks hard to purchase, even for hospitals and health care workers.

The result: Many people needed masks, and one of the only ways to get one was to make it at home or get someone to make it for you. That’s where women came in.

“Anecdotally, everybody I’ve known who’ve made masks are women,” Margaret M. Chin, a sociology professor at Hunter College and the author of Sewing Women: Immigrants and the New York City Garment Industry, told Vox.

Sewing masks requires materials — fabric, thread, and ideally a sewing machine — that women may be more likely to have on hand than men are. And in general, the skill of sewing tends to be passed down from mothers to daughters, Chin said. “Men don’t learn it because they’ve always believed that it’s a skill for women, and it’s always been paid very low wages.”

While some people made masks for family and friends, others have been volunteering through groups like Face Mask Aid, which was started in March and has distributed more than 6,400 masks to health care workers, firefighters, transit workers, and others. It’s not a surprise that many of the volunteers making masks have been women, many say. “Whenever there’s an emergency in the United States, women have always been called to make or create things,” Chin told Vox.

For example, after the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco, “women started coming together with other women and basically made impromptu soup kitchens right on the spot,” said Joslyn Brenton, a sociology professor at Ithaca College and a co-author of Pressure Cooker.

Even in normal times, women are more likely to volunteer than men are. And with social distancing guidelines making many types of in-person volunteering difficult, sewing masks is something people can still do — provided they have the skills and materials to do it.

But it’s not just volunteer work that’s often dominated by women. An increasing number of companies are pivoting to manufacture cloth masks during the pandemic, and the workers doing the sewing are likely to be those who typically do garment work in the US, Chin said: Asian American and Latinx immigrant women. Those women are on the front lines of the pandemic in many ways, Chin said, leaving their homes daily to make essential goods. But garment work in America is overwhelmingly low-wage work.

“It takes quite a high amount of skill to sew a mask,” Chin said, explaining that sewers have to know how to put in elastic, fold the fabric properly, and lay it out so that it falls correctly on the wearer’s face when assembled. But “I think because it’s been looked at as women’s work, it’s been devalued.”

The pandemic is changing how families shop and eat. Women are likely to bear the brunt of those changes.

Sewing isn’t the only form of labor that’s been affected by the pandemic. The spread of the virus has also changed the way many Americans feed themselves. With restaurants closed around the country, many people who might once have eaten out are now cooking all or most of their meals at home. And women may be bearing the brunt of that increase in meal preparation.

Women already spend more time cooking at home than men do — in one 2016 study, the average woman spent 50 minutes on cooking a day, while the average man spent 20. And while it’s too early for data on how families are feeding themselves during the pandemic, it’s likely that the increased demands of cooking every day will fall disproportionately on women as well.

That’s especially true because it’s not just about chopping, stirring, and sautéing. “The cognitive labor of getting food on the table has increased,” Sarah Bowen, a sociology professor at North Carolina State University and co-author of Pressure Cooker, told Vox. Shortages of staples like flour mean it can be harder to find everything a family needs, and public health officials have advised people to minimize shopping trips in order to limit exposure to the virus, meaning shoppers have to get everything they need in one weekly or biweekly trip.

And previous research shows that women take on more of the cognitive labor of household work — things like keeping a grocery list in their head — than men do, Bowen said. That kind of labor “is very, very gendered, even in situations where people might divide the physical tasks a bit more evenly.” In particular, research shows that women do more of the work of anticipating a family’s needs — knowing, for example, when the household is about to run out of toilet paper — than men do.

The demands of shopping and cooking during the pandemic likely fall especially hard on low-income women. Poor families often “don’t have enough money to have a pantry that’s very well stocked,” Bowen said, “which makes it all the more precarious when the store runs out of milk or eggs.”

And while some workers, many of them white-collar, are able to work from home during the pandemic and may have some flexibility in their schedules to shop and prepare meals, essential workers often don’t have that luxury. Some of those essential workers spend their days making sure others can eat, sometimes at the cost of their own safety. In particular, more than two-thirds of cashiers at grocery stores and fast food restaurants are women, Brenton said. These workers are in a vulnerable position, sometimes asked to work in crowded stores without proper protective equipment.

Historically, “women have been doing the majority of the work of feeding families and feeding other people,” Brenton said. And that work is now more difficult, and sometimes more dangerous, than ever.

With schools and day cares closed, women are likely to take on more child care

While the pandemic has changed how families feed themselves, it may have brought an even greater change in how they care for children. With schools and day cares closed around the country, many for the rest of the academic year, millions of children nationwide are now home with their parents all day. For many families, that means juggling child care and supervising online classes while working, whether it’s done from home or elsewhere as an essential worker.

As with cooking, there’s no clear data yet on how families are splitting up child care during the pandemic. But based on previous research, it’s possible to make some predictions. In heterosexual couples, “many of the gendered routines will likely spill over during the pandemic, which means that women are likely still doing a greater proportion of housework and child care,” said Yavorsky, who studies how families divide work.

That’s especially likely to be true in cases where the woman’s income is lower than the man’s, Yavorsky said. Given the uncertain economic outlook, families may choose to protect the man’s job at the cost of the woman doing more child care. For women, “if they are not the breadwinners, they may see an even greater deprioritization of their career,” Yavorsky said.

The picture could be different in some families, especially if the mother is working away from home as an essential worker, Yavorsky said. “If women, many of whom are on the front lines, are at work, men inevitably will spend more time doing child care.”

But for a lot of women, the pandemic could worsen existing inequalities holding them back in the job market. And there’s already evidence that women’s careers may be taking a hit. Editors of some academic journals are noticing a decline in submissions by female scholars, according to the Lily. One analysis of astrophysics paper submissions found that women’s productivity loss in recent months was up to 50 percent greater than men’s.

Unequal division of household labor during the pandemic could harm women’s long-term career prospects, Yavorsky said. What happens during this time could “position them to be less likely to get the next promotion, or less likely to get a wage increase.”

Meanwhile, the workers who used to provide child care while parents worked outside the home are now either out of work or risking exposure to continue working, often without adequate sick leave or health insurance. The National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA), which represents home care workers, house cleaners, and nannies, found in a survey that as of April 6, 72 percent of such workers were unemployed.

Those who are still working are often providing child care for the families of essential workers or home care for older adults or people with chronic illnesses. Home care workers, in particular, “are the only ones who are able to ensure that those people are staying safe, healthy, and staying out of our overburdened health care system,” Ai-Jen Poo, executive director of the NDWA, told Vox.

Related How the coronavirus pandemic will affect an entire generation of students

These workers are overwhelmingly female — more than 90 percent of domestic workers are women, Poo said, and the workforce is disproportionately women of color. And the majority are caring for their own children or other family members in addition to the people they care for at their jobs.

But domestic workers are typically not prioritized for Covid testing, often lack health insurance, and often earn “literally poverty wages” — an average of $16,000 a year for home care workers, Poo said. “When you think about what people are risking to keep us safe and keep this country together and what level of insecurity they’re living with right now, it’s really devastating.”

The pandemic could lead to a reckoning on “women’s work.” But only if we let it.

Across the board, women seem to be doing a disproportionate share of the work to keep people safe, fed, and cared for during this pandemic. And they’re often doing it without proper recognition or compensation. But, experts say, there’s also a chance for the pandemic to usher in a larger reckoning around the gendered division of labor in homes and in society.

“Some gender scholars are arguing that this pandemic may create the opportunity for men and women in heterosexual families to both gain more awareness of how much is involved in managing a household and raising children,” Elliott, the Pressure Cooker co-author, said. That could be an opportunity for couples to negotiate a fairer balance.

But for that to happen, “communication is really key,” Yavorsky said. “Couples need to come together and discuss all of the detailed tasks that need to get done for a day and try to allocate them as evenly as possible.”

And on a broader societal level, the work of caring for others needs to be valued as the essential labor that it is, advocates say. The NDWA is backing the Essential Workers Bill of Rights, which would provide domestic workers and others on the front lines with paid sick and family leave, hazard pay, and PPE, among other protections. Beyond that, domestic workers also need a living wage and health insurance, Poo said. “It is about ensuring and shoring up the safety net and access to quality jobs with benefits for this workforce that has historically been left behind.”

It’s also time to place a higher value on the work of sewing masks, many say. “Each one can take half an hour or an hour or even more to craft,” Chin said. “Why wouldn’t you pay somebody $40 for that?”

For Piontkowski, compensation is also key to making the work of sewing masks feel less exploitative. She heard of one volunteer who was asked to donate masks to a large grocery store — and while the workers there may not be able to afford the masks, she believes the store itself probably could. “They have money — they should just pay people,” Piontkowski said. “It seems pretty basic, but it is hard to get people to think about it that way.”

Overall, it’s laudable that women have often stepped up in times of crisis to use their skills and help others. But that willingness to pitch in shouldn’t be taken for granted, many say. Instead, we need to be asking questions as a society about the work of caring, cooking, and sewing for others during the pandemic, Elliott said — questions like, “is it visible as work that’s necessary to support communities?” and “is it being recognized as such, and in what ways?”

For Yavorsky, the pandemic has the potential to “expose a lot of the invisible work that many women shoulder” and to encourage society to value that labor more highly. “I am hopeful,” she said, “but I think it’s going to take a lot of hard work.”

"['Anna North', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-03-27,"The sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden, explained","A woman who worked in Joe Biden’s Senate office filed a criminal complaint with the Washington, DC, police on April 9, accusing the former vice president of sexually assaulting her in 1993.

Tara Reade, the former Biden staffer, described the allegation in an interview with podcast host Katie Halper on March 25. Reade said Biden pushed her against a wall and penetrated her with his fingers. When she pulled away, she says, he said he thought she “liked” him.

Reade told Business Insider that she filed the report because she had been harassed in the past and “wanted to make it clear that I would be willing to go under oath or cooperate with any law enforcement regarding it, because it did happen. Even if it was 26 years ago.”

She also acknowledged in a tweet on April 10 that the statute of limitations had run out on her complaint. On April 24, new details emerged in the case: The Intercept reported that Reade’s mother had called CNN’s Larry King Live in 1993, saying that her daughter had experienced “problems” with a prominent senator. Then, on April 27, Business Insider reported that a former neighbor said Reade had told her about the alleged assault in 1995 and 1996. The additional details have reignited controversy around Reade’s allegation, with prominent Democrats coming to Biden’s defense and others arguing that Biden should step aside as the presumptive nominee.

When asked to comment on the criminal complaint against Biden, a campaign spokesperson referred Business Insider to deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield’s previous statement, provided March 27 after the controversy heated up from Halper’s podcast: “Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false.”

Last year, Reade was one of several women who came forward publicly to say Biden had kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable. At the time, Reade said Biden used to “put his hand on my shoulder and run his finger up my neck” when she worked in his Senate office, but she did not accuse Biden of sexual assault.

Reade says she did not speak publicly about her more serious allegation last year, in part, because no one else witnessed the incident, while she says others saw Biden harassing her.

She also says she faced online harassment after coming forward last year. As Ryan Grim reported at the Intercept on March 24, journalists and others questioned her credibility, pointing out favorable comments she had made about Vladimir Putin in a 2018 Medium post, perhaps implying that she was a Russian plant.

Read this love fest for Putin by Alexandra Tara Reade.

Is this the same person who just made an accusation against @JoeBiden?

If so — this game’s up.https://t.co/B4CShgbiYp — Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) April 4, 2019

In March, Reade’s allegation initially received little coverage outside of left-wing media (and some media outlets on the right). But the hashtags #IBelieveTara and #TimesUpBiden started to pick up steam on Twitter after Halper’s podcast, as many wondered why it was not getting more attention.

One of the only news source to report on @JoeBiden's sexual assault allegations is Yahoo. If you supported the #metoo movement, yet think these allegations are false and ""Russian plants"", you are putting women down. You're not a feminist #IBelieveTarahttps://t.co/minMJzqy5n — Elliott Crow (@crow_elliott) March 27, 2020

The allegation also inflamed tensions between supporters of Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who, at the time, was losing to Biden in the primaries. Reade told Vox on March 26 that she initially supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president (and also supported Marianne Williamson) but now supported Sanders. (Sanders has since dropped out of the presidential race.) And her report led to allegations by some that she or her supporters were simply trying to throw the election to Sanders — or even to President Donald Trump.

Reade acknowledged the concern that her allegation could benefit Trump in the general election. Trump himself has been accused of sexual harassment, assault, or other misconduct by more than 20 women, and is being sued for defamation by two of them.

“I don’t want Trump to be president,” Reade told Vox. But, she said, she won’t be voting for Biden. “If he’s my president, I just can’t fathom it.”

Multiple women have said Biden touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable

Reports of “creepy” behavior by Biden, like standing too close to women for photo opportunities, have circulated for years, treated by some as little more than a joke. But those reports received more serious attention after Lucy Flores, a former candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada, wrote in a March 2019 essay at The Cut that Biden had kissed her on the back of the head at a campaign event in 2014.

“I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything,” Flores wrote. “I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me.”

After that, other women spoke out to report similar experiences. Amy Lappos, for example, said that at a 2009 fundraiser, Biden touched her face and rubbed noses with her. And in April, Reade told the Union, a California newspaper, that Biden touched her several times in ways that made her feel uncomfortable, and that her duties in his Senate office were reduced after she refused to serve drinks at an event. She said he wanted her there because he liked her legs.

A few days after women began coming forward with reports of inappropriate touching by him, the former vice president issued a statement saying that “social norms have begun to change” around people’s personal space and that he would be more mindful of boundaries in the future.

Biden did not specifically respond to Reade’s allegation, but in a video statement in early April, he said, “I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and women by the shoulders and say, ‘You can do this.’” However, he also said that “the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset” and pledged to change his behavior.

Since then, the allegations by women have not come up much on the debate stage or campaign trail, and Biden is the presumptive nominee to be the Democratic nominee for president this year.

Reade’s allegation came back to the fore when Grim reported on its general outline in the Intercept. Then Halper released her interview on her podcast, The Katie Halper Show. In it, Reade says that in 1993, when she was in her 20s and working for Biden, another staffer asked her to bring him a gym bag at the US Capitol.

When she did, she says, he pushed her up against a wall in a secluded area, began kissing her, and reached under her skirt to penetrate her with his fingers. After she pulled away, she says he responded with something along the lines of, “Come on, man, I heard you liked me.” Reade said Biden also said something that sticks with her today: “You’re nothing to me.”

Those words affected her “almost more than the assault,” she said, because she had respected him so much before.

“It was like an earthquake,” Reade told Vox in March. “I was so excited about this job. I thought this was my future, and so when that happened I felt, it’s like someone pulling the rug out.”

In addition to Bedingfield’s statement, the Biden campaign also released a statement in March from Marianne Baker, an executive assistant to Biden from 1982 to 2000. “In all my years working for Senator Biden, I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period — not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone,” Baker said. “These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades.”

Reade, for her part, said she did not include the assault accusation when she spoke out last year because the harassment was easier to talk about, in part because others had witnessed it.

“I wanted to share the whole thing, but at the same time I was too scared,” she said. “I just wasn’t quite ready.”

Grim at the Intercept contacted Reade’s friend and brother, both of whom say she told them about the alleged sexual assault by Biden in 1993.

“Woefully, I did not encourage her to follow up,” her brother told the Intercept. “I wasn’t one of her better advocates. I said let it go, move on, guys are idiots.”

But earlier this year, Reade decided that she wanted to speak publicly about the assault allegation. She reached out to Time’s Up, an anti-harassment organization launched as the Me Too movement rose to prominence, to see if she could get legal representation. However, Grim reported, the organization said it could not support her because Biden is a candidate for federal office and doing so could jeopardize its nonprofit status.

The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which is administered by the National Women’s Law Center, countered that it did offer some help to Reade. Uma Iyer, the center’s vice president of communications, said in a statement to Vox that “we helped Ms. Reade as much as we could, within the guardrails that necessarily shape our work.” The organization “provided her with the information to connect to attorneys and other resources” as it has done for many others, Iyer said; however, “We informed Ms. Reade of our inability to fund legal and PR fees for her due to our 501(c)(3) status.”

“The TIME’S UP Legal Defense Fund is the first-of-its-kind entity, and above all else, we prioritize survivors and their quest to seek justice – but we cannot do that if our nonprofit status is in any way threatened,” Iyer said.

Unable to get legal help, Reade told Vox, she decided to write about her experience on Medium in January. She did not state an allegation of sexual assault then, but said that “I have not told the whole story of what occurred between Joe Biden and myself.” That led to interest from some smaller media outlets and the interview with Halper, she said. “I kind of feel like a weight was lifted off when I did that interview,” Reade said. “Now I’m ready to walk away, and now everyone wants to talk to me.”

After the Intercept, Halper, and others covered Reade’s story, new details began to emerge. Reade had told the Intercept that she talked about her experience with Biden with her mother, who died in 2016. Reade said her mother had even called Larry King Live to ask for advice after her daughter left her job with Biden. On April 24, Grim reported that a listener had tracked down a call, presumably made by Reade’s mother, to the show on August 11, 1993.

“I’m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington,” the caller says. “My daughter has just left there, after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.”

The caller doesn’t specifically mention harassment or assault, but as Grim noted, Reade said the transcript “gelled with her memory” of the call, which also tracks with her assertion that she told her mother about an experience she had with Biden that would damage his reputation if made public.

Then, on April 27, Business Insider reported on accounts by two more people who said Reade told them about her experiences with Biden in the 1990s. Former co-worker Lorraine Sanchez told Business Insider that she recalled Reade saying, in the mid-90s, that her former boss in Washington had sexually harassed her.

Meanwhile, Lynda LaCasse, Reade’s former neighbor, told Business Insider that in 1995 or 1996, Reade confided that she had been sexually assaulted by Joe Biden. “This happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it,” LaCasse said.

The new details have inspired renewed attention to Reade’s story. Many in the Democratic Party, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, have pledged their support for Biden. Others, meanwhile, have stepped up their criticism of the presumptive nominee, sharing their disapproval with the hashtag #DropOutBiden.

The GOP is already weaponzing Biden’s unanswered rape allegations, and evidence of his decline.



Many partisan Democrats have chosen to ignore those issues.



That might have worked in partisan primaries, but ensures a Trump victory in November.

Mainstream media initially did not cover Reade’s assault allegation

Part of the reason Reade sought legal help, she told Vox, was that she faced harassment when she initially came forward last year. She also faced scrutiny into her background. In particular, critics pointed to that now-deleted 2018 Medium post in which Reade called Putin “a compassionate, caring, visionary leader” and said, “To President Putin, I say keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe, just maybe America will come to see Russia as I do, with eyes of love.”

In the same post, she wrote that she left government work in her 20s in part because “I love Russia with all my heart” and “I could not stand to watch the deception and xenophobia that came from my own American government.”

Reade told Vox that when she wrote the praise of Putin, she had “watched a bunch of Noam Chomsky” and was working on a novel set in Russia. She says she no longer feels the same way about Putin since learning more about domestic violence in Russia.

But “this conversation isn’t about Russia,” she told Vox. “Joe Biden wasn’t asking me about my feelings about Russia when he had his hands where they weren’t supposed to be.”

Some have dismissed Reade’s sexual assault accusation because Reade was a Sanders supporter and because it was first publicized by left-wing outlets. Halper was also a vocal Sanders supporter, and most mainstream news organizations did not initially cover the story. The New York Times published an article on April 12 about the allegation.

“Of course, if it’s a choice between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, from my perspective, I’m going to pick Bernie Sanders,” Reade told Vox March 26, and added that Sanders supporters were kind to her when she was harassed online after coming forward last year.

Social media conversation helped bring attention to Reade’s story, with #IBelieveTara and #TimesUpBiden trending by the end of the week in which she appeared on Harper’s show. Overall, the social media reactions could have been broken down into two camps: those who cited her praise of Russia and implied that she or her supporters were working on behalf of Sanders, Trump, or Putin; and those who cited the need to believe people who come forward to report sexual misconduct.

Still time to vote for the non-creepy, non-harassing Presidential candidate. #TimesUpBiden https://t.co/NSLJ6RlJr2 — Prerna Lal (@prernaplal) March 27, 2020

Reade’s report came at a time when Sanders was trailing behind Biden in the primaries and Biden was likely to face Trump in the general election. Before Trump was elected, numerous women had accused him of sexual assault and harassment, and he was caught on tape bragging about his ability to grab women “by the pussy.” He was elected anyway.

While Reade is no fan of Trump, she said she is disturbed by the fact that Biden is “running on a platform of character.”

“The Uncle Joe thing, I never saw that,” she said. “He was very strong, he was very powerful, and he knew it, and he used his power to get what he wanted.”

"['Katelyn Burns', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,What will Pride mean this year?,"Last June, about 2.5 million revelers flocked to WorldPride in New York City for the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, the rebellion against anti-queer policing that Pride is meant to commemorate. The atmosphere was joyous, the parade most notable for its scale: a record 150,000 people marched down 5th Avenue, past the Stonewall National Monument, and through Manhattan. Lady Gaga, Madonna, and Kim Petras were among the many performers who played in festivals throughout the week — all in celebration of the progress LGBTQ people and rights have made over the last half-century.

But this year’s Pride will look much, much different. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, there’s just no way to facilitate in-person festivals for the foreseeable future.

Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last week that NYC Pride — along with every other mass gathering event in the city in June — will be canceled. This follows a larger pattern of other cities around the world forgoing in-person Prides this year.

“Over the last month, we’ve had now about 280 Prides globally that have canceled or postponed because of Covid-19,” said Steve Taylor, board member of the European Pride Organizers Association (EPOA).

Pride organizers say the show will go on, though — albeit in a much different format. The EPOA and InterPride, a consortium of local Pride organizations in the US and internationally, are organizing a massive, worldwide Pride event to be held exclusively online.

BREAKING - NYC Pride, along with all other ""non essential permitted events in June"" -- CANCELED, Mayor DeBlasio announces. #abc7NY — Derick Waller (@wallerABC7) April 20, 2020

The plan is to hold a rolling 24-hour online Global Pride on June 27, the anniversary of Stonewall, which will feature musical performances, speeches, and other Pride-related content each hour. While it’s too early to say who exactly will be a part of the online Global Pride — InterPride also organizes a WorldPride every few years in different cities — Taylor said that organizers have partnered with national Pride networks in the US, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the UK, as well as organizations in Africa, Asia, South America, and the Oceania region. The hope is to coordinate it so that local Prides — from Sydney to San Francisco — will have 15 minutes of their own based on their time zone.

“We’re going to start from the East and obviously make our way to the West,” said Julian Sanjivan co-president of InterPride. “It’s going to be a very interesting production. We are looking at not just entertainment pieces but human rights components [as well].”

But the over-the-top celebrations that have become synonymous with Pride are only one aspect of its mission. Another huge part of Pride month is advocacy. Smaller LGBTQ groups often depend on fundraising from Pride-related events to help serve their communities throughout the year. And now amid the pandemic, many are afraid their efforts may get lost in a sea of online need this year.

“Right now, nobody knows what to expect,” said Mahdia Lynn, executive director of Masjid al-Rabia, a small Muslim community center in Chicago that was founded by and for trans, queer, and disabled Muslims. Last year during Pride month, Masjid al-Rabia collected about $10,000. But this year, the organization won’t be able to hold any in-person fundraising events.

“We have lowered the expectation of how much we’re going to raise,” said Lynn. “Our original goal was to increase the fundraising that we had last year by at least half and ideally to double it, and now instead, our plan is to just aim to maintain what we raised last year.”

But while fundraising goals stay the same, need among the most vulnerable in the LGBTQ community will grow as the pandemic stretches on because the LGBTQ community was already suffering from higher rates of unemployment, food insecurity, and lack of insurance before the pandemic. Visibility — of not just celebration but for community support — will be more important than ever.

The importance of — and complications in — taking Pride online

The folks behind this year’s online Pride felt it was important not to skip a year as Pride can be important to queer people who are attending for the first time.

“Every Pride organizer that you talk to will have a story about someone that has come to their Pride, whose life has been changed by Pride,” said Taylor. “It might be the first time in their life that they felt safe, that they felt part of the community, that they felt valued and loved or that they felt surrounded by people who are like them rather than feeling like an outsider. It’s really critical for Pride organizers — because we believe passionately in our movement and its transformative effects on people — that we find a way to deliver that event in a safe way [during the pandemic].”

Organizers admit that it won’t be the same as previous in-person celebrations, but they also hope that the online format will bring Pride to countries that are actively hostile to the existence of LGBTQ people, such as Poland or Saudi Arabia.

“One of the really good things about Global Pride is that it will allow people in, for example, Subsaharan Africa or in the countries in the Middle East where being LGBT either is illegal or even attracts the death penalty, it will allow them to take part in Pride,” said Taylor.

Even in countries considered “progressive” or safe, LGBTQ rights has a way to go. Last Friday, news broke that the Trump administration was finalizing an Affordable Care Act rule that would allow health care discrimination against LGBTQ people. The community also waits for Supreme Court decisions on whether employers can, under federal civil rights law, legally fire people for being queer or trans.

In the UK, Women and Equalities Minister Liz Truss gave a speech to Parliament’s Women and Equalities Select Committee on April 22 indicating that the country’s Equality Act could be revised to keep trans women out of women’s spaces and trans teens could be barred from accessing any gender-affirming health care.

The internet isn’t immune to homophobia and transphobia, and there are security concerns to consider when taking Pride online. While plans are still in the early stages, organizers told Vox that they hope to partner with a larger platform, like Facebook, in order to facilitate Global Pride. They envision the rolling entertainment format alongside a chat box or comment system that allows participants to send messages or photos.

But that opens the door to potential brigading from trolls. Swarming a third-party online event is nothing new, but it has seen a resurgence during the pandemic. Reports have emerged of “Zoombombing,” where uninvited trolls crash a video call in order to harass participants with racist, homophobic, or anti-Semitic hate speech.

Global Pride organizers are trying to prepare for that possibility. “We’ll have people from the community moderating those comments so that we don’t get trolls posting transphobic or biphobic or homophobic comments,” said Taylor. “Obviously, it’s slightly more difficult on social media, but certainly in terms of the livestream, that will definitely be moderated. It will be a safe space as much as we can make it, the same as it was the same as any Pride would be.”

The corporatization of Pride versus protest

The first Pride march in 1970 was relatively small and community-based, and meant to commemorate the Stonewall Riots from the previous year. Many of the earliest Prides were more overtly political than the annual rainbow extravaganzas seen now, advocating for the decriminalization of homo- and transsexuality.

But over the years, Pride has become a way for corporations to virtue-signal their support for LGBTQ people. Last year’s WorldPride celebration in New York City featured many official corporate sponsors (T-Mobile, L’Oreal, and Hyatt Hotels), and Pride marches from Portland, Maine, to Seattle, Washington, are filled to the brim with corporate floats and cisgender heterosexual allies marching alongside.

In 2017, the protest group No Justice No Pride disrupted DC’s Capital Pride, an InterPride partner, in part because of the parade’s support for police marching in the parade, but also over its corporate focus.

“When we targeted them, we were targeting a power structure and we were targeting the symbols that build up that power structure within Capital Pride,” said Emmelia Talarico, director of No Justice No Pride. Talarico said that Capital Pride feels the need to cater to corporate interests because organizers get a raw deal on funding from the city, which benefits from the thousands of tourists Pride draws every year.

While specific sponsors haven’t yet been announced for Global Pride, corporate interest is expected to follow the move online. “These things have to be paid for; it’s very difficult to pay for a Pride without corporate income,” said Taylor. “Actually, it’s better that corporates pay for it than the people who attend Pride pay for it. Even if it’s only $10, as soon as you have to pay to attend a Pride, it’s going to exclude people.”

Taylor said that corporate support for Pride gives multinational corporations a chance to show support for their LGBTQ employees, “as long as it sits within an ethical framework.” But therein lies the problem for protesters, who say that many of these companies do not operate ethically. This is how you end up with Lockheed Martin Pride floats at Capital Pride in 2018, supporting white and Western queers while profiting off the bombing of the same Middle Eastern countries Taylor hopes his online Pride will reach this year. Meanwhile, T-Mobile, a presenting sponsor for NYC Pride in 2019 and 2020, has been criticized by LGBTQ union rights group Pride at Work for its anti-union actions.

Moving in-person Pride online could result in a nonstop corporate lovefest and leave less room for the visibility of everyday queer people, advocates worry. In years past, many protests have shut down or delayed Pride marches that had strayed too far from the original mission. In Toronto in 2016, Black Lives Matter protesters halted the march for several hours to object to the presence of police at the parade. But with strict online moderation, advocates wonder: How many queer voices of protest will be shut out this year?

“The people who protest against Pride, I think they missed the point,” said Taylor. “Actually, it’s surely better to get behind Pride and celebrate what Pride offers and the human rights that we campaign for and the equality that we celebrate rather than, you know, picking a fight with a few volunteers just trying to create an inclusive event for our community.”

While many major cities will be joining up with Global Pride, some — like Denver, Colorado — are organizing their own local online Pride celebrations. Others have just postponed their Pride parades, hoping the pandemic lockdowns will lift in time to host a celebration this year.

For Talarico, the move online gives her group an opportunity to organize its own space. “In my mind it’s like, okay, cool, let them have their own digital space and we’ll make ours,” she said about Global Pride. “And then that way, ours can be way more focused on the different communities and people who really need this, and theirs can be focused on being white and mediocre.”

LGBTQ fundraising around Pride may take a hit this year

Many LGBTQ organizations — from major movement funders like the Gil Foundation to local queer health clinics — coordinate their annual fundraising efforts around Pride month to hit their fundraising goals for the year. While exact numbers are difficult to calculate, a large percentage of LGBTQ funding is raised during the month of June, when most Pride marches and celebrations are held. Organizations don’t necessarily fundraise directly at Pride festivals or marches, but often hold in-person fundraisers and funding campaigns throughout the month when visibility of LGBTQ people and concerns are at their strongest.

But the Covid-19 shutdown means those events won’t be happening this year and may look dramatically different next year.

Many organizations have already turned to online fundraising campaigns in the hope of stop-gapping their budget holes. The Trans Justice Funding Project, for example, pools smaller donations to make grants for community projects run by and generally benefiting the trans community. In years past, the grant-making process was facilitated through in-person meetings, typically in New York City, where the organization’s grant-making fellows would decide who gets the grants.

This year, however, the organization has moved to online meetings to have those discussions. “As most people have had to pivot to try to figure out how to do things all virtually, we are also experiencing that,” said Foster. But of bigger concern for Foster is how the economy will affect fundraising, rather than the medium the fundraising occurs through. Over the last three weeks, 22 million people have filed initial claims for unemployment insurance. While larger LGBTQ organizations may have institutional funders, smaller groups like the Trans Justice Funding Project generally do not.

“I just really hope that people will support [trans communities] in any way possible beyond Pride,” said Foster. “Then also for the long term, because this is going to be a long haul for us all. And it has always been a long haul for trans communities trying to make magic out of very little, but this is what they have always done.”

Masjid al-Rabia typically raises a large portion of their annual budget in the months of May and June because they tend to coincide with Ramadan and Pride, according to Lynn. This year, Covid-19 has doubled the fundraising pressure faced by the organization.

Last week, they launched Radical Muslim Mutual Aid, a program that directly funds the basic needs of queer and trans Muslims in the Chicago area who are struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. Within the first 24 hours, the program received enough requests to exhaust its $10,000 seed money.

“We’re trying to get more rapid-response funding from foundations, social justice organizations, and trying to just get the money out,” she said. “What is happening everywhere right now in response to the pandemic that we’re in is there is far more need than there are resources.”

Some larger LGBTQ organizations have seen this need and responded with immediate campaigns. On Sunday night, queer media advocacy group GLAAD hosted an online event called “Together in Pride,” which raised money for local LGBTQ organizations and health care providers. The event featured live performances from Barbra Streisand and Pose’s MJ Rodriguez, among many others, and a short message from former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.

The online Global Pride event will raise money for InterPride’s Solidarity Fund, which goes toward building Pride events in locations around the world that are actively hostile or dangerous for LGBTQ people.

Meanwhile, groups like Masjid al-Rabia just hope they aren’t forgotten about when the rainbow ads, from the groups that can afford them, pop up in June. “The best way that you can trust that you’re serving your community and a community that doesn’t leave anyone behind — not just that gay world that serves wealthy white gays and lesbians — is to give it to small community organizations,” Lynn said.

"['Rani Molla', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,The demand for midwives is surging. Here’s why I made the switch to home birth.,"I’ve been told that pregnancy can be a singularly difficult experience, filled with physical and psychological stress, like preeclampsia, heartburn, and existential dread. Well, I raise you the coronavirus pandemic.

I am eight months pregnant, and in the past month and a half I’ve gone from planning a delivery at a Manhattan hospital to a home birth 175 miles away, where my partner and I have been building a home. I am not saying this is the right decision, but it is mine.

It is also a decision many others are making. City midwives are reporting a surge of interest that they cannot meet. At the end of March, Google searches in the US for “home birth” were at their highest level in five years.

One woman I spoke with, Meghan (who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy), is 34 weeks pregnant in San Francisco and switched to a midwife early last month after hearing from her sister and brother-in-law, both doctors, about the hazardous situation in the hospitals there.

“I don’t want to be kicked out of the hospital,” Meghan said. “I don’t want to be induced. I just don’t want to have these interventions that are Covid-related in my birth. And I also want to just be as comfortable and as positive as possible and not scared.”

My home birth decision was made for similar reasons, but there were also other factors.

On March 22 — the day after our canceled baby shower, and two days after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a stay-at-home order for the entire state — New York-Presbyterian, the hospital where my obstetrician delivers, said that partners would not be allowed in the delivery room. That meant I and many New Yorkers would have to give birth alone.

But I knew of the myriad World Health Organization-recognized benefits of having a companion by my side. It felt wrong to do otherwise. So much of pregnancy is biological and thus falls to women; not having my partner be able to support me through it seemed a bridge too far.

Many other pregnant people and their advocates felt the same way, as is evidenced by the more than 600,000 people who signed a Change.org petition to safeguard one’s right to having a birthing support person present during labor.

Cuomo has recognized families’ worries. Last week, he announced the creation of a task force that would help authorize birthing centers as alternatives to hospitals. These typically freestanding health care facilities focus exclusively on prenatal care and delivery, and have a more homey bent than hospitals. He also issued an executive order to reverse the no-partner rule that several New York City hospitals had instated.

But I was still afraid that hospitals might override it, or that rules could change again before my due date. I understand why they might — doctors are trying to keep patients, families, and staff safe. So far, it seems hospitals have been inconsistent with policies regarding allowing birth partners.

Like Meghan, I also didn’t know if I’d want to be in a hospital anymore, crowded as they were with coronavirus patients and health care workers trying to make do without enough. My body is already at the behest of forces beyond my control; I didn’t want the hospital system to be one more thing that was out of my hands.

So I made the decision to get back some agency.

Fears around childbirth multiplied once the pandemic hit

Mine has been a planned and uncomplicated pregnancy. I’m an adaptable person and had mostly been calm and upbeat. Then came the coronavirus. I’ve joked that I got a pandemic in exchange for being so sanguine about the birth of my first child.

Prior to the pandemic, I didn’t have many stipulations about how I was going to give birth, but knew two things: I wanted a natural birth, and I wanted my partner to be there to help me. I wanted it to be as straightforward as possible, and at the time that had meant delivering at a hospital I trusted.

But as with most Americans, the pandemic has exacerbated existing stressors, and things have since become less straightforward.

I am without the support of other family nearby. My sisters live in other states and my mom thinks the coronavirus is a hoax, or at least greatly exaggerated, and that the government’s response in ordering people to stay home is a huge overstep. That is to say, I’m trying not to talk to her about anything Covid-related, which is hard given the times, so I talk to her less.

Then there is my job. To avoid stress, people tell you not to pay attention to the news. As a journalist, that’s more difficult. I, for one, have been charting the exponential curve of coronavirus cases and their mounting death toll for a living. That’s as the economy is collapsing and I fear for my own job, as journalists are being laid off due to plummeting ad revenue, even as readership hits new highs.

Add to that the continual sirens in the city that wracked my nerves. Every trip out of my giant apartment building to walk my dog felt like a Navy SEAL expedition to keep from touching surfaces or running into other people. Our close friends can see a refrigerated morgue truck from their apartment in Brooklyn. I grieve for the unclaimed graves on Hart Island and makeshift hospitals in Central Park. It’s all a lot to bear on top of the regular stresses of pregnancy.

In other words, the decision of where and how to have a baby has changed drastically in the past few months. The plan had been to give birth at a hospital in New York City and then spend my four months paid leave upstate, where we have basically been retrofitting a metal garage to have plumbing and heat. That plan has been accelerated in the pandemic.

In March, I asked my doctor, whom I had sought out and trust, whether she thought hospitals would be safer in New York City — which was already being inundated with coronavirus cases and where obstetricians have been called in to help — or upstate, where case numbers were lower but hospitals had fewer overall resources. She said she didn’t know.

Already, she had suggested that my by now biweekly appointments would be done via video chat — which to me seemed okay for work meetings but not for something as intimate as my prenatal checkups. That’s when I began thinking about alternative plans.

Before coronavirus, I considered home birth to be a fine option. I’ve had friends who have done home births, which involve engaging the services of a midwife, a medical professional who does all of your prenatal exams and oversees your labor outside of a hospital setting. I asked my doctor about the option and she said that since I have a low-risk pregnancy, it would be fine.

Meghan, like me, had already been committed to a natural birth and saw a home birth as best allowing her to be able to do that. “I feel like having that other layer of fear laying over things — is this nurse scared to be here, was she exposed, was she in the ICU last week, do they have proper masks, how many times have they worn that mask? — I don’t want to think about that while I’m giving birth. I just want to think about giving birth,” she said.

Midwives, though, have cautioned against using the coronavirus and the related fear of hospitals as the overriding reason to switch to home birth. “Fear and panic do not lend themselves to an empowering homebirth,” midwife Robina Khalid explained in an open letter on behalf of the New York City Homebirth Collective. “If a pregnant person originally chose a hospital because they believed it to be the safest location in which to give birth, that belief continues to make the hospital the safest place for that person to give birth.”

Midwives are rightly worried about spreading resources too thin and maintaining a manageable client load. “​Part of what keeps our care safe now, in the time of Covid-19, is to prioritize our resources,” Khalid wrote. And midwives, like other health care providers, are struggling to find protective equipment. “The nature of our jobs is that we cannot socially distance. The reality is that some of us will become ill during this time.”

This leaves many pregnant people caught between an overtaxed hospital system and overtaxed midwives. The birthing centers Cuomo hopes to fast-track will be a welcome alternative for many. But just over a month away from giving birth, I have already made my decision.

When I mentioned my worries to a friend upstate a couple of months ago, she recommended her midwife. She told me she would only consider having another child if she could do it with this person — a recommendation worth a thousand Yelp reviews. Fortunately, this midwife had an opening for me.

I met with the midwife, told her my concerns, and asked her all of my questions, like how far into my labor could I expect her to come over, how long would she stay, and how would we get the baby’s vaccinations afterward. She was smart, thoughtful, and seemed like someone I could trust. It was the first time in a long while that I felt I could let go of just a hint of worry.

Preparing for home birth in an uncertain world

One thing that is important to my story: We had the means to leave the city and hire a midwife, while many others do not. The ability to travel and the luxury of having access to a second home is not one most Americans have. And my insurance largely covers out-of-network medical care, including midwives. Instead of our rental apartment or our unfinished garage-home, we were able to stay at my grandma’s house, which is located nearby in the northern Catskills. My grandmother died two years ago, right before my partner and I were married. While she will never see her grandchild, her house has helped him immeasurably. It feels nice to think of her still taking care of me.

I’m overwhelmed, tired, and depressed. It’s hard to parse what part of that’s from pregnancy and what’s the enormous weight of the outside world during this remarkable point in time.

It’s been more than a month now since I’ve moved upstate, having little physical contact with the outside world. I meet with my midwife every other week, and the personal attention is exactly what I need right now. She checks the baby’s heartbeat and tests for protein and glucose in my urine. We both wear masks. She palpates my stomach and can feel that my baby is already facing head down, ready to enter this strange world. If I were in Brooklyn, presumably a pared-down version of these appointments would be done by my obstetrician over a computer screen, which would be fine but certainly not the same as a warm hand on my belly. We’re currently gathering a list of supplies to have on hand for the delivery, like plastic sheets, extra towels, and flexible straws for my drinking comfort.

It’s also become clear that all my pregnancy and coronavirus fears are not going to be abated by a midwife and a move to the woods. I’m still overwhelmed, tired, and depressed. It’s hard to parse what part of that’s from pregnancy and what’s the enormous weight of the outside world during this remarkable point in time.

I find myself reading any incremental study on how susceptible pregnant women and babies are. So far I don’t seem more at risk, though the prospect of having coronavirus while pregnant obviously wouldn’t be pleasant. Cases in babies appear to be rare, but any case is heartbreaking, as would having to be separated if I became infected.

Meanwhile, I still have more work than ever and what feels like fewer resources with which to do it. Not to mention, I’m weighing the ethics of having my sisters visit me. And then I think of my mom, whom I see in the angry — and probably fearful — faces of those protesting stay-at-home orders. I don’t know when I’ll let her see the baby.

I try to remember that I am one of many who are scared and uncertain right now. Nearly 4 million people give birth each year in the US, and they are all fighting their own battles in their own situations.

Like many of them, I do not know if my decision is the best one. But it is my decision, which is incredibly valuable when so much about the world is uncertain.

"['Anna North', 'Apr']",2020-04-27,How the pandemic turned Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer into an unlikely firebrand,"Gretchen Whitmer has been called a lot of things in the last few weeks.

The Michigan governor is a “rising star for Democrats,” according to the Washington Post, and a potential vice-presidential pick for presumptive nominee Joe Biden. According to President Donald Trump, though, she’s “the woman in Michigan” or “Gretchen ‘Half’ Whitmer.” And if you ask right-wing protesters, she’s a tyrant trampling on Michiganders’ rights during the coronavirus pandemic.

The thing is, though, Whitmer has never been a political firebrand. The Lansing native ran for governor in 2018 on a platform of fixing the state’s roads and cleaning up its water, and while she’s taken progressive stances on some issues, she’s typically portrayed as a centrist by opponents and supporters alike.

So how did Whitmer become the subject of nationwide controversy? It started with Michigan’s coronavirus crisis — the state is among the hardest hit, with nearly 34,000 cases and more than 2,800 deaths as of April 22. In March, Whitmer called out the Trump administration for failing to help Michigan and other states get tests and protective equipment — and Trump responded by insulting her. Soon Michigan became one of the most visible sites of conservative protests against social distancing rules — protests encouraged by Trump’s tweets.

Amid all this (and perhaps to some degree because of it), Whitmer is reportedly being considered as a possible VP candidate this November. And she’s become one of the most visible Democratic faces in the fight against coronavirus, leading a group of governors in calling on Trump for more aid to states and writing a New York Times op-ed about the need for social distancing measures despite the economic toll they take.

Whitmer insists she’s not seeking the national spotlight. “I was thrust into this moment because of this pandemic,” she told Vox. “I’m going to take every opportunity I can to help people understand how serious this moment is, so we can save lives.”

But whatever her intention, the national spotlight has found her, and now Americans across the political spectrum are watching to see how she handles the current crisis — and President Trump.

During the pandemic, Whitmer has emerged as a foil for Trump

Whitmer’s nationwide profile started rising before the current crisis hit. In February, she delivered the Democratic response to Trump’s State of the Union address, shouting out the work of Democratic governors around the country to expand health care and boost working people’s pay. “I’d need a lot more than 10 minutes to respond to what the president just said,” she told Americans. “So instead of talking about what he is saying, I’m going to highlight what Democrats are doing.”

Getting picked to deliver the State of the Union response is typically a sign of party favor, and Whitmer “occupies an important position” in Democratic politics right now, Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist, told Vox. Michigan is key for Democrats because of its electoral votes and the way it’s been hit by recent economic crises — and because Trump won there in 2016. Meanwhile, there’s an increased admiration within the party for the leadership experience that comes with being governor, Sefl said.

“I was thrust into this moment because of this pandemic. I’m going to take every opportunity I can to help people understand how serious this moment is, so we can save lives”

“Governors are executives,” she explained. “That’s a distinguishing characteristic from being one of a hundred senators or one of hundreds of members of Congress.”

And when the coronavirus pandemic hit the US, governors became more visible than ever. With the Trump administration slow to act and inconsistent in its messaging, it’s often been up to state governments to decide how best to keep their residents safe.

Michigan emerged early as a hotspot of the virus, becoming the fourth hardest-hit state in the country by the end of March. And on March 20, Whitmer expressed a frustration shared by many governors when she said, in a CNN interview, that she had sought help from the Trump administration in getting tests and protective equipment and had not received it.

“I don’t want to be in a sparring match with the federal government,” she said. “But we are behind the eight ball because they didn’t do proper planning.”

Trump seemed to take that as an invitation to, well, a sparring match. He complained about Whitmer on Fox News, saying, “I don’t know if she knows what’s going on, but all she does is sit there and blame the federal government.” And on March 27, he said in a White House briefing that he had told Vice President Mike Pence, who’s in charge of the federal coronavirus response, not to call “the woman in Michigan.”

“If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call,” he said. The same day, he called her “Gretchen ‘Half’ Whitmer” on Twitter and said she “likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude.”

I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen “Half” Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2020

Meanwhile, Michigan continued to grapple with a growing number of coronavirus cases and deaths. And on April 9, Whitmer extended the state’s stay-at-home order and added additional restrictions, including requiring large stores to close sections devoted to gardening supplies, paint, and furniture.

This requirement, in particular, incensed some conservatives, who viewed it as arbitrary when other goods, like lottery tickets, could still be purchased in the state, Vox’s Jane Coaston and Aaron Rupar reported. “I can’t go to the hardware store and buy grass seed for my lawn, buy a gallon of paint so that I can find myself doing a home project so I don’t go absolutely insane being locked at home,” Matt Seely, spokesperson for the Michigan Conservative Coalition, told Vox. “I mean, none of that makes any sense.”

On April 15, about 3,000 protesters, led by the coalition, descended on Lansing, Michigan, to oppose Whitmer’s order in what they called “Operation Gridlock.” While protesters were told to stay in their cars, some got out and stood close together, breaking social distancing guidelines.

“People coming together, congregating without masks, within six feet of one another, and then going back out to other parts of the state is exactly what threatens to continue the spread of Covid-19,” Whitmer told Vox. “I know every one of us wants to reengage our economy when it’s safe to do so, and each time this happens, it makes it less likely that we can take those additional steps.”

Trump, however, praised the protesters, tweeting “LIBERATE MICHIGAN” on April 17. He also called for the “liberation” of Minnesota and Virginia, states with Democratic governors that had been the site of protests.

The protesters seem to represent a small minority of Michiganders, and Americans as a whole. As of April 15, 81 percent of Americans wanted to maintain social distancing for as long as necessary to curb the spread of coronavirus, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll. As Whitmer put it, “People understand the severity of the issue.”

But the protests have been highly visible, in part because of Trump’s encouragement. And now, Whitmer has emerged, in some ways, as Trump’s antithesis — the sober, reasonable voice advocating social distancing while Trump sows chaos and talks about injecting disinfectants.

Whitmer also stands out on the national scene for another reason. She’s “a woman governor with a very hard-hit state,” Sefl said. “That alone makes her stand apart from the coverage.”

Her gender has certainly colored Trump’s response to her — it’s hard to imagine him talking about “the man in Michigan.” It’s also influenced the tenor of the Michigan protests. Demonstrators in Lansing carried signs comparing Whitmer to “a tyrannical queen and an overbearing mother,” according to MLive, and some chanted “lock her up!” in a callback to the perennial Trump-rally attack on Hillary Clinton.

Press coverage of Whitmer has also taken on a gendered tone. The governor “might seem like a pushover,” Tim Alberta wrote at Politico magazine on April 9. “With the suburban-mom hairstyle, the high-pitched giggle, the nasally accent straight out of ‘Fargo’ central casting, she looks like the type of person—OK, the type of woman—that Donald Trump would chew up and spit out.”

It’s not clear that Trump is better at “chewing up” women than men — in fact, his record with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggests that at times, he’s afraid of women in power. But it’s certainly true that, if Whitmer does join Biden’s ticket in November, she’ll be a target of sexism from the president and likely from his supporters as well.

When asked if she’s been treated differently because she’s a woman, Whitmer just laughed — for a long time. “The reality of being female on the political stage in the United States of America is, of course, we confront that,” she said finally. “I don’t focus on it because I’ve got a job to do, but yes, of course, it’s there.”

She could have a national future — but she’s still battling the crisis at home

Given her very public back-and-forth with Trump, it’s perhaps no surprise that Whitmer has been getting more attention as a possible running mate for Biden in recent weeks. The former vice president hosted her on his podcast on April 6, calling her “one of the most talented people in the country.” She’s also made made frequent appearances on television and in the press. “She’s become somewhat familiar in the political spotlight, she’s embracing that role,” Sefl said.

When it comes to the vice-presidential race, Whitmer told Vox that “I have an incredible amount of respect for Joe Biden” and that it’s an honor “to be included in the names of candidates that I know they’re thinking about.”

But she says the goal of her public appearances is to educate the public about the virus and get aid for her state, not audition for bigger things. When she gives interviews, she said, “it’s because I want people to know what’s happening here so that I can get some help.”

Still, the vice-presidential race is, of course, connected to Whitmer’s performance in Michigan. Perhaps this year more than ever, what happens in the run-up to the nomination will matter a lot, Sefl pointed out. Because of the pandemic, there may not be a Democratic convention. And Trump may not agree to debates.

“We might be absent those traditional opportunities to view and judge a candidate,” Sefl said. For Whitmer, that means “the persona that she’s really solidifying right now will become that much more important.”

It’s not just about persona — it’s also about what she actually does. Michiganders have generally approved of Whitmer’s handling of the crisis, but the state has also seen enormous racial disparities in the impact of the virus, with black residents getting sick and dying at much higher rates than white Michiganders.

Whitmer has established a task force to address those disparities, led by Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II. And some have praised the governor’s efforts to help the communities hardest hit by the virus, like a moratorium on evictions and an extension of SNAP benefits. “Those are really important policy measures that the state and the governor have taken to mitigate the impact of Covid on black families and all of those who are impacted economically,” Afton Branche, strategic projects manager with the Detroit Partnership on Economic Mobility at Poverty Solutions, told Vox.

But the disparities in Covid-19 deaths also point to systemic problems in Michigan that some say the governor has been slow to tackle. One is a lack of access to clean water. Tens of thousands of people in Detroit have had their water shut off in recent years, thanks to high poverty and a lack of programs to make the utility affordable, Justin Onwenu, a Detroit-based environmental justice organizer for the Sierra Club, told Vox.

Activists were telling the Detroit and state governments before the Covid-19 crisis that lack of water was a public health hazard, but their requests were denied, Onwenu said. Then when Covid-19 started, families across the city had no water to wash their hands.

The governor announced a statewide moratorium on shutoffs on March 28. “This is a critical step both for the health of families living without a reliable water source, and for slowing the spread of the Coronavirus,” she said in a statement at the time. “We continue to work to provide all Michiganders — regardless of their geography or income level — the tools they need to keep themselves and their communities protected.”

But the moratorium came “after weeks and weeks and years and years of pressure,” Onwenu said.

Since the crisis hit, “Gov. Whitmer has been getting a lot of attention, but things are not going well when you look at the racial data,” he said. “I’m a little bit frustrated that the conversation is all around the optics of how things are being handled, and I definitely think that there are a lot of systemic things that have gone unaddressed for far too long.”

Whitmer is pledging to address some of those systemic issues with the task force. “We have to acknowledge the disparities in outcomes that have long plagued the United States of America and the individual states but that now more than ever are front and center,” she told Vox. “It’s got to drive a lot of the work that happens not just in this moment but well beyond it, because this is holding up a mirror to inequities that have been generational and historical in this country.”

Whitmer’s ability to take on those inequities in her state will determine how effective she is in responding to the current crisis — and could have implications for the kind of running mate, and the kind of vice president, she would be. So could the way she continues to respond to Trump.

But Whitmer says she’s not thinking about the national stage yet: “Right now 100 percent of every waking moment is focused on doing what I’ve got to do to help Michiganders get through Covid-19.”

"['Maia Niguel Hoskin', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-25,The whiteness of anti-lockdown protests,"Last weekend, thousands gathered in Washington, Michigan, Texas, Maryland, and California to protest lockdown orders resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Some marched with rifles draped across their backs and handguns resting on their hips, while others shared conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and his involvement with the Covid-19 vaccine.

Even in larger, less-rural cities in California, groups waved “Trump 2020” flags and marched the streets with signs that read, “No Liberty. No Life.” And these protests only seem to be picking up steam: On Friday, thousands stormed the Wisconsin State Capitol, carrying flags and wearing Tea Party regalia.

But what has been most glaringly obvious about these protests isn’t the far-right theatrics. It’s that almost everyone marching to end stay-at-home orders is white. And if they do return to “regular life” and refuse to distance themselves, their overt disregard will impact the population most vulnerable to the virus — black people.

It’s easy to dismiss the anti-lockdown protests as business per usual in the land of right-wing Trumpism. But there is a much larger issue at play that existed long before President Donald Trump took office, and that he has learned to artfully exploit. It’s why it’s not surprising that in some areas, protesters waved Confederate flags or held signs that read, “Give me liberty or give me Covid-19.” The protests are symptomatic of the profound presence of whiteness and white supremacy in America.

On the surface, the protests are about the contentious debate over reopening the economy during a pandemic, when more commerce risks more infections and the overwhelming of our hospital systems. Trump and other Republicans who have pushed to scrap lockdown orders sooner rather than later argue that doing so will prevent the country from going into economic collapse.

“You’re going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression,” said Trump during a press conference on March 24, when he first began pushing the idea of reopening the economy, only one week into the lockdown. “You can’t just come in and say let’s close up the United States of America, the biggest, the most successful country in the world by far.”

But if states open back up, it will come at whose expense? In the US, black Americans are dying of Covid-19 at disproportionate rates to other racial and ethnic groups. According to an American Public Media Research Lab report published this week, almost 50,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the country. Data for about three-fourths of those deaths reveals that the mortality rate for blacks is 2.7 times higher than for whites. Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the population, they represent 30 percent of Covid-19 patients in the US. The data continues to reveal which Americans face the greatest risk if the country is reopened.

To be fair, some protesters have expressed a deep financial need to return to work, to keep their lights on and a roof over their heads, which is understandable given that 26 million Americans have lost their jobs — skyrocketing the unemployment rate. As the first of the month quickly approaches, many Americans are wondering how they’ll pay their rent and only 80 million of 171 million Americans have received their CARES act stimulus checks so far.

But these protests are also attended by Trump supporters who have been convinced by conservative media pundits like Fox News contributor Bill Bennett, who during an April 13 interview on Fox, argued that the virus is actually less deadly than the seasonal flu and that “this was not and is not a pandemic.” Before Covid-19 began to ravage our country in February, the Trump administration doubled down on claims that the virus was no more deadly than the seasonal flu, and that containment was “airtight.” These claims were made despite the CDC warning that community spread was inevitable and the country would most likely experience severe interruptions in daily life.

Admittedly, I might also be eager to return to swapping germs, if I thought the virus was nothing worse than a cold and if I lived far away from the cities experiencing widespread infection, as many of the protesters do.

But this isn’t just happening in rural areas. Protests are also happening in wealthy, elite, and yes, very white cities and suburbs too. Residents of Newport Beach and Huntington Beach, two Southern California coastal cities in Orange County, aired their grievances by the hundreds last week. Protesters were seen socializing and laughing, wearing pro-Trump baseball caps while standing far less than the advised six feet apart.

Huntington Beach and Newport Beach have some of the highest numbers of confirmed cases in Orange County, yet the residents’ eagerness to end social distancing orders feels informed and motivated by the reality of who is most impacted by Covid-19 — black communities. Both of these cities are predominantly white and affluent; Newport Beach’s median income hovers around $123,000 while Huntington Beach’s is about $88,000, compared to the national median income of $62,000.

While it might seem ludicrous that whiteness and income level would somehow make people immune to infection, there is some truth to such beliefs. In the event that these rich white folks find themselves with a cough and fever, they are more likely to have the reassurance and privilege of access to local testing centers and quality, unbiased health care. Meanwhile, black people do not have access to quality and racially unbiased health care. Between 2010 and 2018, blacks were 1.5 times more likely to be uninsured compared to whites.

Black people also have a higher prevalence of heart disease and high blood pressure, and black men have the shortest life expectancy of all other racial and gender groups — and racism and discrimination are the drivers of these poor health outcomes and inequities. In fact, disparities such as these have never been more apparent than in this pandemic: Doctors have expressed concern that Covid-19 testing is not as accessible to black communities. Meanwhile, blacks and Latinos also make up the largest number of essential workers, who are most at risk of infection.

Race and socioeconomics do absolutely play into who is most vulnerable to getting Covid-19 — and who is most likely to die.

Oppression 101

On Twitter earlier this week, I saw a meme about whites feeling oppressed by the current lockdown order, which I knew had to be a joke (boy, was I wrong). During an interview on Fox & Friends, Michigan Conservative Coalition Chair Meshawn Maddock shared that residents of Michigan “feel oppressed” and “there are certain businesses and workers that should be able to safely get back to work right now.”

Oppressed is an interesting word choice. Let’s start first with what racist oppression is. Oppression is not getting a job, a promotion, a business loan, or approved for your dream home solely based on your race — things black people deal with regularly. On the other hand, oppression is not staying in the comfort of your home, with a full fridge, health care, and a 401k. Oppression is also not a term that should be used willy-nilly, at the first feeling of discomfort, crying it to get your way — putting other people’s health and lives at risk. Many of us are uncomfortable right now. But please do not conflate discomfort with oppression.

Being white is the default identity in America. Whiteness is our cultural tapestry. It’s America’s norm, against which all others are measured, and there is a special kind of security that comes along with being the norm. So when you suddenly do not have free rein to go about your business unchecked, it can feel like a massive threat. And in turn, protesters have taken to the streets to fight to keep that security. That feeling of “oppression” these white protesters have voiced is the residual effect of living in a country that has been shaped to cater to their racial majority status, and consequently, their perceived loss of power and privilege.

Ironically, some of these same conservative white groups that want to be liberated now also vehemently fought tooth and nail against movements such as Black Lives Matter and did not understand the value nor the need for blacks to speak out against their actual oppression. Some of these whites fear the same oppression they have inflicted on people of color, and we’re seeing a glimpse of that fear, without any self-awareness, in the pandemic.

To be clear, most Americans, white people included, are sitting tight at home and obeying social distancing and shelter-in-place orders. But as anti-lockdown protests become more politicized, outrage might begin to grow and others may inevitably join the chorus. This could prove to benefit Trump come election time as he plays to his base, targeting states with Democratic governors who have imposed social distancing orders.

But while it’s natural to marvel at how reckless Trump’s tweets are — like the ones that called for residents of Michigan, Minnesota, and Virginia to “LIBERATE” themselves — the discussion about the president’s Twitter fingers inciting social and racial upheaval is low-hanging fruit. Trump is not the root cause of America’s ongoing saga with racism and white privilege. His rhetoric simply brings to life white supremacist and racially privileged perspectives that have existed for centuries — and have been given the opportunity, in a deeply stressful time, to surface loudly, donning MAGA hats, and exercising their right to bear arms.

"['Katelyn Burns', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,The Trump administration could soon allow doctors to discriminate against LGBTQ people,"The Trump administration is expected to soon finalize a Department of Health and Human Services administrative rule to roll back health care discrimination protections for LGBTQ people, according to a Politico report.

The rule, which was first proposed in May 2019, would reverse an Obama-era interpretation that sex discrimination under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act applied to discrimination against queer and trans people.

Trans people especially face overwhelming levels of discrimination from health care providers. According to a 2010 study, almost one in five trans people said they had been denied care by a medical provider because of their gender identity, and 28 percent were subjected to harassment in a medical setting. It was that reality the Obama administration attempted to address by including LGBTQ people under the definition of sex discrimination, conforming to an increasing wave of state and federal court rulings.

The Obama-era rule made it illegal for doctors, hospitals, and other health care workers to deny care to someone whose sexual orientation or gender identity they disapproved of. What the new Trump administration rule will do, as it was originally proposed, is allow health care providers to deny care to anyone they perceive as trans or gay. It will allow hospitals to house trans women and men according to their birth-assigned sex, or condition emergency treatment on the stoppage of cross-sex hormones. It would also allow insurance companies to reinstate blanket bans on transition-related care like gender reassignment surgery or hormone replacement therapy.

In the age of Covid-19, when hospitals are operating near capacity, the rule could also mean the life of a sick trans person is quite literally at the whim of a doctor’s personal beliefs about trans people.

That fear was already permeating the trans community before news of the finalized rule was released. “I’m scared to say this out loud, but I’m afraid that trans people will face things like being deprioritized for ventilators or for care,” Bre Kidman, a non-binary candidate for US Senate in Maine, told Vox earlier this month.

Politico reports that the rule was circulated among Department of Justice staff Thursday, and the White House updated a regulatory dashboard indicating that the rule is under review, which signals the final ruling could be issued within the next few days.

Gillian Branstetter, a spokesperson for the National Women’s Law Center, criticized the administration’s timing for moving forward with the rule in the middle of a pandemic. “It’s egregious that we are losing 3,000 Americans a day to an unprecedented public health emergency and a top priority of the Trump administration is making sure doctors can turn away trans people,” she told Vox. “We already know that trans people face a patchwork of health inequities that leaves them at risk for any number of health concerns. This rule threatened the well-being of trans people before this pandemic. During this pandemic, it is beyond immoral to worsen any group’s access to health care.”

The Trump administration’s war on trans health care began more than a year ago

The fight over the rule began in December 2018 with a nationwide injunction on the Obama interpretation. It was issued by conservative favorite, federal Judge Reed O’Connor, who has issued numerous rulings overturning Obama-era rules regarding the Affordable Care Act, abortion access, and access to birth control.

It’s that ruling, an HHS spokesperson told Politico, with which the department is complying. HHS head of civil rights Roger Severino defended that agency’s treatment of marginalized communities to Politico. “As we have shown in our recent efforts to protect persons from disability and age discrimination during the pandemic, HHS will vigorously enforce civil rights laws as passed by Congress, before, during, and after any rulemaking,” he said in a statement.

Before his stint as HHS civil rights chief, Severino was a fierce critic of the Obama administration’s efforts to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination. Proponents of the new rule have pushed the false notion that doctors were being forced to perform gender reassignment surgeries that they were uncomfortable with. In reality, transgender surgical care is highly specialized, and trans people are unlikely to go to a doctor who isn’t experienced in the procedure.

With the new rule, the US trans community is now looking at a possible return to a health care environment that allowed oncologists to deny cancer care to Robert Eads, a trans man who developed ovarian cancer and was never notified of his diagnosis. When he finally learned of it, his doctor said his first instinct was to send Eads to a psychologist rather than treating his cancer. Eads died in 1999. Or Tyra Hunter, who died in 1995 after an EMT discovered her trans status following a car accident and refused to touch her on the trip to the hospital, mere miles from the White House.

Aside from the new rule possibly going into effect next week, the LGBTQ community also awaits two Supreme Court decisions on whether queer and trans people are protected under sex discrimination provisions of federal civil rights law.

“Trans people are terrified of the [Supreme Court] case,” said Branstetter. “Behind a lot of that fear is the understanding that the Trump administration has been hard at work instilling long-term damage to LGBTQ rights. It’s not just the Trump administration, it’s an entire sphere of right-wing organizations who have made their primary goal the erasure of trans people from public life.”

Conservatives haven’t let the pandemic slow down their political agenda

Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, there will likely be no White House protests against the new rule, or rallies in multiple cities nationwide to stand up for LGBTQ people.

In many ways, the coronavirus pandemic has provided convenient cover for conservatives to enact several political priorities while the nation’s attention is on the virus and gatherings are strongly discouraged.

At the state level, Idaho enacted two anti-trans laws in late March, while South Carolina held a hearing on a bill that would ban transition care for trans minors while the state was under a shelter-at-home order. Additionally, Trump’s DOJ filed a statement of interest in a federal lawsuit seeking to ban trans girls from high school girls’ sports in Connecticut.

The anti-trans moves join multiple state-level attacks on abortion access during the pandemic, with Texas, Ohio, Alabama, and Mississippi all moving to ban or restrict the procedure under bans on “nonessential surgeries.” Texas eventually eased its ban on nonessential surgeries, while three states saw the attempted bans stopped in federal court — meaning abortion care is still being provided in each state at this time.

Flying a bit further under the radar have also been several attempts to use the pandemic to justify loosening environmental and business regulations, long a goal of the Trump administration.

On March 26, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a directive saying it would “not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the EPA agrees that Covid-19 was the cause of the noncompliance.” The move allows air polluters to flout federal law without fear of penalty, right when clean air is perhaps most important for the health and safety of everyday Americans.

Then, in early April, the administration finalized its rollback of Obama-era requirements for vehicle fuel efficiency.

Several conservative groups, including the Heritage Foundation, also recently released plans for the administration to pursue deregulation of business and environmental rules. Among the Heritage plans the White House found intriguing was a call for the president to ask agencies not to enforce small business regulations altogether.

“A presidential call for a wide-scale policy of non-enforcement would send a very strong signal to businesses that the government is not going to come down hard on them as they try to get back up and running,” the Heritage plan said.

Left-leaning policy experts disagree. “This sounds exactly like the type of opportunistic political move that absolutely should not be attempted right now,” Jared Bernstein, a former adviser to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, told the Washington Post. “Correlations between regulations and economic activity are far shakier than they assume, and I don’t believe this idea will help at all.”

It’s been clear since the pandemic started that there is no bad time for the Trump administration to push their political agenda, even if that means costing Americans — LGBTQ or not — their lives.

"['Ian Millhiser', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,Justice Alito’s jurisprudence of white racial innocence,"On Monday, the Supreme Court held, 6-3, in Ramos v. Louisiana that criminal defendants in state court may be convicted only by a unanimous jury.

The practical impact of Ramos is small — until recently, only two states, Louisiana and Oregon, permitted a non-unanimous jury to convict a defendant. And Louisiana recently amended its constitution to eliminate this practice. But advocates saw in the ruling a big symbolic change in favor of racial justice. As the Court’s lead opinion pointed out, non-unanimous juries are a practice rooted in white supremacy.

One justice took umbrage with that invocation of racism: Justice Samuel Alito. His dissent was the latest in a string of opinions bristling at the idea that racism still shapes many policymakers’ decisions today, and that the legacy of past racism still affects people of color. In the most noteworthy of those opinions, 2018’s Abbott v. Perez, Alito convinced a majority of his colleagues to write such a strong presumption of white racial innocence into the law governing racial voter discrimination that it is now virtually impossible for voting rights plaintiffs to prove that state lawmakers acted with racist intent.

Alito does not appear driven by broad skepticism of racial issues. While he has repeatedly lashed out at the mere suggestion that white policymakers may have been motivated by racism, he took a drastically different tone in Ricci v. DeStefano (2009). In that case, Alito wrote a lengthy concurring opinion suggesting that a cohort of mostly white firefighters were denied promotions due to a conspiracy between New Haven Mayor John DeStefano and a local black preacher.

In other words, when black or brown people have been on the receiving end of allegedly racist treatment, Alito preaches that we shouldn’t jump to such conclusions; yet in a case where white people were allegedly harmed, he wasn’t so cautious.

With his Ramos opinion, Alito continues to build a distinctive profile as a jurist: He has emerged as the Court’s foremost defender of white racial innocence.

Alito scolded his fellow Republican justices for pointing to the legacy of racism

Alito sometimes scolds liberals for attributing modern-day policy outcomes to racism. But in Ramos, much of his vitriol was directed at two of his fellow Republican justices. Indeed, the racist origins of non-unanimous juries were discussed prominently in the Court’s lead opinion in Ramos, which was authored by conservative Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch.

In his opinion, Gorsuch offered a brief history of how the practice of allowing non-unanimous juries to decide a defendant’s fate is rooted in white supremacy. The delegates who drafted Louisiana’s 1898 constitution, Gorsuch argues, “sought to undermine African-American participation on juries” by allowing juries to resolve cases in a 10 to 2 verdict (the idea was that only a small number of black jurors were likely to serve on the jury in the first place).

Gorsuch also argues that Oregon’s use of non-unanimous juries “can be similarly traced to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and efforts to dilute ‘the influence of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities on Oregon juries.’”

Gorsuch’s decision to invoke this dark history produced a livid response from Alito. “To add insult to injury, the Court tars Louisiana and Oregon with the charge of racism for permitting nonunanimous verdicts,” Alito writes in the introduction to his dissent. He adds that “too much public discourse today is sullied by ad hominem rhetoric, that is, attempts to discredit an argument not by proving that it is unsound but by attacking the character or motives of the argument’s proponents,” and accuses the majority of his colleagues of engaging in such rhetoric.

Alito goes on to make a fair point. Though Louisiana and Oregon may have originally permitted non-unanimous jury verdicts to advance white supremacy, “both States readopted their rules under different circumstances in later years.” Louisiana, for example, originally provided for non-unanimous juries at an 1898 constitutional convention dominated by white supremacists. But the state “adopted a new, narrower rule” at a new constitutional convention in 1974.

Alito suggests that it is unfair to attribute the results of the 1974 convention to racism, if the delegates to that particular convention were not actually motivated by racism. It will be interesting to see whether he applies a similarly forgiving rule in a pending case alleging that provision of Montana’s 1972 constitution is tainted by 19th-century anti-Catholic bias. (It’s also worth noting that liberal Justice Elena Kagan joined most of Alito’s opinion, most likely because Kagan is the Court’s most stalwart defender of the idea that the justices should be reluctant to overrule precedents, and Ramos overruled a 1972 decision.)

But Alito’s Ramos dissent also fits into a broader pattern. In multiple cases, including cases where there is clear evidence that modern-day lawmakers acted with invidious racial intentions, Alito treats the mere suggestion that anti-black or anti-brown racism may still play a role in policymaking with contempt.

Alito’s brand of racial resentment is unique on the Supreme Court

It’s notable that both Gorsuch and Justice Brett Kavanaugh penned opinions in Ramos that acknowledged what Kavanaugh described as “the racist origins of the non-unanimous jury.”

And then there’s the Court’s other white conservative, Chief Justice John Roberts. Roberts’s race opinions are animated by his belief that any legal acknowledgment of race is odious, regardless of whether the purpose of a race-conscious law is to foster white supremacy or to tear it down. “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” Roberts famously wrote in an opinion arguing that two race-conscious plans to desegregate public schools were unconstitutional.

Roberts’s form of color-blindness is often actively hostile to civil rights laws. Hence his decision in that school segregation case, and his later decision in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which struck down much of the Voting Rights Act.

And yet, there is daylight between Roberts and Alito. Though Roberts joined Alito’s opinion in Ramos, he did not join Alito’s Ricci concurrence.

And Roberts broke rather sharply with Alito in a recent dispute about whether the Trump administration could add a question to the 2020 census form that would have discouraged many immigrants from participating in the census. Department of Commerce v. New York (2019) involved the Trump administration’s attempt to add a question to the 2020 census form asking whether each respondent is a US citizen.

The idea of adding a citizenship question to the main census form is opposed by prominent census experts in both parties. As top Census officials from the Reagan and Bush I administration warned, adding such a question “could seriously jeopardize the accuracy of the census,” because “people who are undocumented immigrants may either avoid the census altogether or deliberately misreport themselves as legal residents.”

The Trump administration made the implausible claim that it added this question to help enforce the Voting Rights Act — a statute this administration has shown little interest in enforcing. But, while the New York case was pending before the Supreme Court, leaked documents revealed that the administration may have had a very different motive. A late Republican strategist, Thomas Hofeller, who urged the Trump administration to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census form, had determined that such a question would ”clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats” and “advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.”

In any event, a 5-4 Supreme Court struck down the citizenship question, with Roberts coming very close to accusing the Trump administration of lying. The claim that a citizenship question was needed to enforce the Voting Right Act, Roberts concluded, “rested on a pretextual basis.”

Alito began his dissent with characteristic anger at the idea that anyone would dare accuse the Trump administration of racism. In a preview of the sort of rhetoric he later deployed in his Ramos dissent, Alito wrote that “it is a sign of our time that the inclusion of a question about citizenship on the census has become a subject of bitter public controversy and has led to today’s regrettable decision” in the opening paragraph of his New York dissent. For Alito, it was fundamentally wrong to attack “the decision to place such a question on the 2020 census questionnaire ... as racist.”

No other justice joined Alito’s dissent.

Alito’s racial views have fundamentally reshaped American voting rights law

Yet, while Alito’s jurisprudence of white racial innocence is distinct, Alito’s views on race still overlap a great deal with his fellow Republican justices. The greatest triumph of Alito’s efforts to write white innocence into the law came in Abbott v. Perez, where Alito wrote the majority opinion.

The facts of Perez are, to say the least, complicated. In 2011, Texas’s Republican-controlled legislature drew congressional maps that, as a federal court eventually determined, included some districts that were illegally racially gerrymandered. These maps never took effect, in large part because a different federal court determined that they violated the Voting Rights Act.

That left Texas in a bind. In early 2012, the state still had no lawful maps that it could use in its upcoming congressional elections, and the state’s primaries for these congressional races were just a few months away.

As a stopgap measure, a federal court in Texas drew interim maps that the state could use in its 2012 elections. Many of the districts in these hastily drawn interim maps closely resembled the racially gerrymandered districts drawn by the Texas legislature in 2011. The court, moreover, emphasized that “this interim map is not a final ruling on the merits of any claims” that some parts of the map were illegal racial gerrymanders.

The court, in other words, would allow Texas to use imperfect maps for one election only, given the risk that Texas would not be able to hold an election otherwise. But the court was also equally clear that it might strike down some of the state’s racially gerrymandered districts at a later date.

Nevertheless, in 2013, the Texas legislature passed a new law ratifying these interim maps as its own — including the districts that were still being challenged as racial gerrymanders. And Alito’s Perez opinion held that this new law reenacting the racial gerrymanders should be upheld.

“The primary question” in Perez, according to Alito, “is whether the Texas court erred when it required the State to show that the 2013 Legislature somehow purged the ‘taint’ that the court attributed to the defunct and never-used plans enacted by a prior legislature in 2011.”

According to Alito, courts must apply a strong presumption that lawmakers did not act with racist intent — even under the unusual facts that existed in the Perez case. “Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent,” Alito wrote, “the burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State.”

Having laid out this standard, Alito then swiftly absolved the Texas legislature of any racial guilt. “The only direct evidence brought to our attention suggests that the 2013 Legislature’s intent was legitimate,” Alito wrote in Perez. “It wanted to bring the litigation about the State’s districting plans to an end as expeditiously as possible.”

Alito’s argument, in other words, is that the 2013 maps weren’t enacted to preserve a racial gerrymander; they were enacted to shut down litigation challenging a racial gerrymander. And this distinction is sufficient to cleanse the state legislature of any allegation of racism.

It’s as if the school districts on the losing end of Brown v Board of Education (1954) had passed a new law recreating the same racially segregated schools that were challenged in the Brown litigation, but claimed that these segregated schools should be upheld because the new law had a legitimate purpose — to bring the litigation challenging public school segregation to an end as expeditiously as possible.

Alito sees a racial conspiracy when white people are the alleged victims

The common thread animating Alito’s opinions in Ramos, New York, and Perez is that he views allegations of racial animus with extreme skepticism. Someone who reads these cases in isolation, in other words, could easily conclude that Alito is a particularly strident defender of the sort of color-blindness favored by Chief Justice Roberts.

But then there is Alito’s opinion in Ricci v. DeStefano.

Ricci was a difficult case involving the exam that New Haven, Connecticut used to determine which firefighters would be eligible for promotion to lieutenant or captain. The 2003 exam produced significant racial disparities. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg laid out in her Ricci dissent, “the pass rate for African-American candidates was about one-half the rate for Caucasian candidates” on the lieutenant exam, and the “pass rate for Hispanic candidates was even lower.” On the captain exam, “both African-American and Hispanic candidates passed at about half the rate of their Caucasian counterparts.”

These results led to allegations that the test itself was racially biased, and the city eventually decided to disregard the examinations. After a cohort of firefighters who performed well on the exam sued, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reinstate the tests.

Alito joined the majority, but he also wrote a separate concurring opinion suggesting that the city decided to discard the exams, not because of a good-faith concern that the tests’ disparate impact on racial minorities arose from a flaw in the test, but because of a conspiracy involving the mayor and a prominent local black activist. Alito’s concurring opinion describes, at length, the relationship between then-Mayor John DeStefano and the Reverend Boise Kimber, whom Alito described as “a politically powerful New Haven pastor and a self-professed ‘kingmaker.’”

Alito quotes DeStefano’s former campaign manager, who described Kimber as “very good at organizing people and putting together field operations, as a result of his ties to labor, his prominence in the religious community and his long-standing commitment to roots,” and Alito also claims that “Rev. Kimber adamantly opposed certification of the test results—a fact that he or someone in the Mayor’s office eventually conveyed to the Mayor.”

The implication of Alito’s opinion, in other words, is that the tests were scuttled due to a corrupt bargain between the city mayor and a local black activist that DeStefano needed to turn out votes.

Alito’s concurrence hedges a bit. His ultimate conclusion is that “a reasonable jury” could conclude that the city tossed out the exams due to pressure from Kimber. But Alito’s Ricci opinion shows none of the caution — and certainly none of the anger — that Alito musters when someone suggests that a white policymaker might have been motivated by racism against people of color.

Alito raises his allegations of a racially motivated conspiracy, moreover, despite the fact that there is considerable reason to reject this theory of why the city tossed out the tests. Among other things, as Ginsburg points out in her dissent, “the decision against certification of the exams was made neither by Kimber nor by the mayor and his staff.” Rather, “the relevant decision was made by the [New Haven Civil Service Board], an unelected, politically insulated body.”

It is still possible that the Civil Service Board felt pressured to throw out the test by the mayor, and it is equally possible that the mayor acted the way he did due to pressure from Kimber. Ginsburg’s opinion does not reject Alito’s theory outright — though it does express a great deal of skepticism. As mentioned above, Ricci was a tough case. And it’s doubtful we’ll ever know with certainty why the city decided to discard the tests.

But if there were plausible reasons to suspect that invidious racial motives played a role in Ricci, there was far more reason to suspect such motives in Abbott v. Perez. Both cases required judges who were, at the very least, open to the possibility that racial animus tainted the government’s decisions.

Alito is not that judge.

"['Anna North', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,“I did not sign up for the military. I signed up for Walmart.”,"Share All sharing options for: “I did not sign up for the military. I signed up for Walmart.”

A few weeks ago, Evelyn Hall asked her manager at Walmart why the store wasn’t giving workers gloves and masks.

The manager’s response, according to Hall: “Wash your hands every 15 minutes, so you don’t need a glove or a mask.”

“She just walked away from me and started laughing, like it was funny,” Hall said.

The lack of protective equipment wasn’t the only reason Hall, a Walmart employee for 28 years, felt unsafe at her Maryland store. The store also wasn’t counting customers to maintain social distancing and prevent crowding, she said. And she’d heard from other employees that workers at her store had contracted Covid-19 — but management had never informed other employees or closed the store.

Hall is 68 years old with diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that put her at high risk of severe illness from the coronavirus. With so few protections in place, she felt Walmart was putting her life on the line.

“I did not sign up for the military,” she says she told her manager. “I signed up for Walmart.”

She is far from alone. Grocery workers around the country say that despite their position on the front lines of the pandemic, stores have been slow to implement policies that would keep them safe. And the toll of the virus on the people who help feed America has already been devastating: As of April 18, at least 18 Walmart employees had died, and 10 percent of the company’s workforce was on leave, according to the Wall Street Journal. Workers have died at Trader Joe’s, Safeway, and Kroger stores around the country as well.

Stores have made some changes in recent weeks, with Walmart announcing it would require (and provide) masks for employees beginning April 20. The company also says it is limiting the number of customers in stores and has processes to inform employees if their coworkers test positive.

But according to some employees at grocery store chains around the country, policies handed down from the top aren’t necessarily being put into place in actual stores. And some say that without tighter enforcement at the federal and state level, companies have no incentive to put the safety of their employees over their profit margins.

“It really shouldn’t be left to large nonunion corporations to decide unilaterally what is the appropriate level of safety precautions to take for their workers,” John Logan, a professor of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, told Vox.

Grocery store workers say their stores aren’t keeping them safe

Grocery store employees have become more crucial than ever during the pandemic, as restaurants close and many Americans shelter at home. Grocery store sales were up 83 percent for the two weeks ending March 22, MarketWatch reports, and though some of that may have been initial panic-buying, Americans are likely to keep buying more groceries than usual as they continue cooking at home. And they can’t do that without the people who stock the shelves and work the cash registers. Like the doctors and nurses who care for the sick, these are essential workers without whom the rest of America could not function.

But grocery workers are now at high risk, spending their shifts largely indoors in settings where it can be difficult to maintain the CDC-recommended 6 feet of distance between people. And some say their employers aren’t doing what’s necessary to protect them.

“I have not been provided with anything by the store itself in terms of PPE,” Mary Mueller-Reiche, a cashier at a Ralph’s grocery store in Los Angeles, told Vox. Coworkers and, once, even a customer have shared gloves with her, and she’s worn homemade masks, she said.

That’s not the only problem. As the coronavirus began to spread more rapidly in mid-March, the store instituted crowd-control measures. But at the end of the month, it suddenly went back to business as usual, Mueller-Reiche said.

“Nobody was standing 6 feet apart; there were way too many people in the store,” she said. “It got really, really scary.”

The stress of working under such conditions sent Mueller-Reiche into a panic attack that left her physically unable to work, she said. She’s been off work since then on the advice of a doctor.

Kroger, the parent company of Ralph’s, has not responded to Vox’s request for comment. The company announced earlier this month that it would limit occupancy at stores nationwide to 50 percent of normal capacity according to building codes. But Mueller-Reiche says that at her store, the occupancy limits weren’t shared with shoppers or employees. And “when we spoke out about safety concerns,” she said, “we were met with disbelief.”

Crowding is an issue at Walmart, too, workers say. On one recent Sunday, “that store was so packed,” with “no 6 feet distance or anything,” Hall said. Managers weren’t counting customers to make sure limits were enforced, she said.

“It really has become profit over lives,” Cyndi Murray, an associate at the same store, told Vox.

No one is forcing companies to prioritize worker safety

What Hall and Murray experienced is a nationwide pattern, Walmart workers say. “Across the country, management is still failing to enforce strict limits on the number of customers allowed in a store and failing to provide us with basic protective equipment,” a group of employees wrote in a letter sent to the company’s board on April 16. Meanwhile, “in many stores, management has failed to tell us when one of our coworkers gets diagnosed with Covid-19 so that we can get tested ourselves or self-quarantine in order to protect ourselves, our families, and our customers.”

It’s not just Walmart, either. As of April 1, employees at Office Depot, Walgreens, and Target were being discouraged from wearing masks, sometimes because of concerns that customers might find them “unsettling,” according to the New York Times. In March, a coalition representing Trader Joe’s workers said the employees were not being allowed to wear gloves. In early April, employees at MOM’s Organic Market in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, staged a protest demanding that the store limit customers and take other steps to keep them safe.

“We didn’t sign up to be heroes, and we certainly didn’t sign up to be martyrs,” Mariane Leon, an employee, told WHYY.

As the virus has spread and workers have begun speaking out, grocery companies have been taking some steps to protect employees. Walmart announced on April 3 that, beginning the following day, it would limit store occupancy to five customers per 1,000 feet, or about 20 percent of normal. When a Walmart employee tests positive for Covid, “we have processes in place to inform associates within the impacted store,” Rebecca Thomason, senior manager of corporate communications at the company, told Vox.

Meanwhile, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said on April 22 that the chain would begin requiring workers at all its stores to wear masks. Kroger and Albertson’s have also joined with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union to call on officials to designate grocery workers as emergency personnel, which could get them better access to Covid-19 testing and protective gear, according to NPR.

But corporate policies aren’t necessarily trickling down to stores. “It’s one thing having a policy, it’s another making sure that it’s actually being strictly adhered to and properly enforced in individual stores,” Logan said. And grocery workers around the country are saying that when it comes to the number of customers, for example, “the limits are often not being enforced.”

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued guidance in March on preparing workplaces for Covid-19. But it is nonbinding, and while thousands of workers have filed complaints, it’s not clear that anything will be done about them.

That has left companies to decide for themselves how to protect their workers, and workers say they’re not being prioritized. Companies “can point to all sorts of positive things they say they’re doing,” Logan said, but “they shouldn’t be allowed to decide for themselves what’s enough.”

Some parts of the country are responding to the problem more quickly than the federal government. On April 15, for example, California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health issued new guidance for grocery stores, including limiting the number of customers and providing masks if the proper distance cannot be maintained. Those guidelines can be a model for the rest of the country, Logan said, but they have to be enforced. “These things have very limited value without having a proper system of enforcement,” he said.

For Hall, in Maryland, going to work no longer feels safe. She went on leave after feeling ill on April 7, and she isn’t sure when she’ll go back. In addition to herself, she’s worried about bringing the virus home to her daughter, who lives with her.

“We’ve got our lives on the line trying to take care of their customers, when we could be home with our families,” she said.

"['Roxanna Asgarian', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,"Louisiana’s longest-serving incarcerated woman is supposed to be free. Instead, she has Covid-19.","Gloria Williams has been in prison for nearly 50 years. In 1971, she and several others robbed a grocery store with a toy gun; after a struggle with the store owner, who was armed, someone in her group shot the owner with his own gun. She was 25 years old, the mother of five kids, and sentenced to prison for the rest of her life. She is currently Louisiana’s longest-serving incarcerated woman.

At the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women, Williams has become a mentor for the younger women there, who affectionately call her “Mama Glo.” She has also been a member of the prison’s drama club for two decades. “Everyone knew and loved Mama Glo and really called on her as the matriarch of the prison,” said Fox Rich, who served time alongside Williams and is now a criminal justice advocate.

Last year, Williams’s large family worked tirelessly to help her put together a clemency application, which, if approved, would allow her to go free. About 30 members of her family traveled to her clemency hearing in July, mostly from Houston and Beaumont, Texas, to tell the judge in person the things they included in letters to the Louisiana Board of Pardons — her hard work to change herself over the years from a domestic abuse survivor who “took a wrong turn” in life, as her sister Mary Smith-Moore put it, into a woman others looked up to and relied on.

The Board of Pardons unanimously approved her clemency application that same month.

“I spoke at her clemency hearing,” Smith-Moore said. “The experience was indeed positive, and we were grateful that they heard us — they read our letters, and they recognized all the efforts she put in to become a different version of who she was.”

Williams got to meet her grandchildren for the first time at the hearing. The mood was bright — like a family reunion, fitting in the big missing piece — and Williams began to plan for her return.

Instead, the clemency application has sat on the desk of Louisiana’s governor, John Bel Edwards, for nine months waiting for his signature. “They said, ‘Wait till the election.’ We had family friends out in droves voting for this person because supposedly he was going to grant her petition,” Smith-Moore said. “And then there was a runoff, and ‘Wait till the runoff.’ And it still hasn’t happened. When the coronavirus outbreak started reaching the US ... we have been on pins and needles.”

Over the weekend, Smith-Moore and the rest of Williams’s family finally got news — but it wasn’t about her release. They were told through Rich, who helped them work on Williams’s clemency application, that Mama Glo was hospitalized in critical condition and having trouble breathing.

Days later, Williams’s attorney was able to confirm that she tested positive for Covid-19 and was receiving oxygen and antibiotics to fight pneumonia in both her lungs.

“We are just devastated,” Smith-Moore said. “We’ve been calling, leaving voicemails at the governor’s office, getting no answer. Asking him to take a look at this and get her out of there because of her age, and what is she gonna do at her age? She’s not a danger to society or to anyone. And she’s at the most vulnerable age [for serious complications from Covid-19]. It’s just inhumane almost, really.”

Jails and prisons are in crisis around the country

Prisons and jails are hotbeds for the spread of Covid-19 due to the number of people in tight quarters, inaccessible cleaning and grooming supplies, lack of adequate medical care, visits from the outside population, and a staff that enters and leaves each day — all potential factors leading to the rapid spread of this disease.

On top of that, prison and jail populations experience preexisting conditions that leave them particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 — including heart problems, high blood pressure, tuberculosis, and asthma — at a much greater rate than the general population.

Thousands of incarcerated people and corrections staff have been stricken with the disease. As of April 22, New York state reported 844 staff, 239 incarcerated people, and 35 parolees had tested positive for Covid-19; 12 have died. At Rikers Island in New York City, 93 of every 1,000 inmates have tested positive as of April 21; in the rest of the city’s population, that number is 16 of every 1,000. In Ohio, 2,011 incarcerated people at the Marion Correctional Institution, more than three-quarters of its population, have tested positive for the virus as of April 22; one has reportedly died. Among staff, 154 have tested positive and another has died. In Cook County Jail in Chicago, nearly 400 incarcerated people have tested positive for Covid-19, and six have died as of April 21.

As these outbreaks continue and intensify, public health officials, advocates, and some district attorneys and sheriffs have called for thinning out jail and prison populations. “This is a public health crisis that threatens to become a humanitarian disaster,” warned the Brooklyn DA, the former health commissioner, and the president of the Ford Foundation in a New York Times op-ed late last month.

Many advocates say the officials who have the power to release people in prisons and jails are generally moving too slow and releasing too few to mitigate the spread of the disease. In Texas, an attempt to reduce the number of people in the Harris County Jail in Houston was met with a state-level resistance from Governor Greg Abbott; in the meantime, at least 151 jail staff and 99 incarcerated people have tested positive for Covid-19.

Governors have a range of tools to help toward this aim, including granting clemency, giving more credit for time served, and temporarily furloughing prison populations. In some states, governors are using those powers fairly aggressively: California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, ordered the early release of 3,500 people from prisons over the next two months. Iowa has released 811 people from prison since March 1 and recently announced releasing 482 more. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he had no plans to release anyone early from the state’s prisons, although he announced that 1,100 people across the state “may be released” with community supervision.

In Louisiana, the governor is not going far enough to help ease the Covid-19 cases among the incarcerated

In early February, the Advocate reported that Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards commuted the sentences of 34 incarcerated people since taking office in 2016, an increase from former Governor Bobby Jindal’s three individual sentence commutations over the course of his two terms in office. But Edwards’s number is still only 16 percent of the more than 200 approved clemency applications he’s been given from the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Parole.

In mid-April, the Louisiana Department of Corrections announced its plan to review about 1,000 prisoners who are scheduled for release in the next six months over whether to give them a temporary medical release during the crisis — a plan advocates say does not go nearly far enough. “Subjecting people who are already within six months of their release date to a cumbersome, one-sided review process does not go nearly far enough to avert a prison pandemic that would disproportionately impact people of color and further strain our health care system,” Alanah Odoms Hebert, executive director of the Louisiana ACLU, told the Advocate. “We urge Governor Edwards to heed the advice of public health experts and use his executive power to reduce our prison population — before it’s too late.”

“This is a public health crisis that threatens to become a humanitarian disaster”

Williams’s lawyer, Mercedes Montagnes, said that instead of fighting for her life in the hospital, Williams should be home right now with her family. Montagnes said that despite the months going by after her clemency application was approved by the board, Williams never lost hope for that reunion. “Gloria is a compassionate and thoughtful woman. She’s a religious woman, and she’s very patient,” Montagnes said. “She has a huge, vibrant, loving family. She was just so eager to get home to them.”

Now that she’s in the hospital, Montagnes said her family is unable to reach her even by phone. “One of the reasons we’re asking the governor to grant clemency immediately is so that her family could have access to her in the ways that others could have access to their family members,” she said. “The humanity of our clients and the people we serve is real, and the current system is not treating incarcerated people as humans.”

Smith-Moore said the family has started a phone chain, each giving each other pieces of news and trying to lift each other’s spirits. They’re praying for Gloria to come home. “God hears prayers. I believe that with all of my heart,” Smith-Moore said.

Still, she and her family are terrified for her sister and frustrated that she isn’t home safe with them in the midst of this crisis. “This is senseless for her to be in this predicament,” Smith-Moore said. And about the governor, “I don’t know what’s so important that you got all these people in your office that you can’t take a look at a paper. I just don’t get it, I don’t understand it.”

"['Fabiola Cineas', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Senators are demanding a solution to police stopping black men for wearing — and not wearing — masks,"On Friday, a group of six US senators, including Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation demanding immediate anti-bias training for law enforcement officials amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The senators wrote with urgency, spurred by recent reports from black men who say they were racially profiled for wearing protective face masks, a measure the CDC recommends to prevent Covid-19.

In a video that went viral earlier this month, an officer in Miami stepped out of his squad car to arrest a black man with a face mask moving items near a van filled with equipment. It took the unmasked officer just over 60 seconds to put the man in handcuffs and detain him. It’s now known that the man, Armen Henderson, was a doctor who has volunteered to test homeless people for Covid-19.

In Wood River, Illinois, last month, two black men wearing surgical masks recorded themselves being trailed by a cop, who was occasionally gripping his gun, in a Walmart store. One of the men said that when the officer approached them, he wrongly told them that there was a national and state order banning the wearing of face masks. The local police department has opened an investigation into the incident and told the Washington Post that the officer followed the men because he believed they were “acting suspiciously.” In the video, the men expressed dismay: “We’re being asked to leave for being safe.”

Not wearing a protective face covering has gotten a black man into trouble, too. A video out of Philadelphia earlier this month shows a black man being forcibly removed from a public bus by at least four officers just a day after the city’s transportation authority required that all riders wear face coverings while on public buses, trolleys, and trains. The video, which shows the police first swarm the man then yank him from the bus, is especially jarring during an already tense public atmosphere. Following the incident, the transit authority announced that face coverings were no longer mandatory.

“These alarming reports highlight the fact that racial biases — implicit or otherwise — don’t cease and in some ways are heightened during a national crisis,” Sen. Booker told Vox in an email. “The truth is, black men in this country are unfortunately all too familiar with racial profiling by law enforcement. It is especially important during these difficult times that these harsh truths continue to be exposed and revealed so that we can continue to work to eradicate bias in policing.”

Booker says he and his colleagues wrote the letter because “we can’t afford the dire consequences of not addressing this issue.”

The police targeting of black men is a longstanding American tradition, one that has naturally incited antagonism and black distrust of law enforcement. This relationship, molded by decades of unequal treatment — as seen through traffic stops, wrongful arrests, officer-involved shootings, surveillance, stop-and-frisk, incarceration, and much more — could prove even deadlier for black people at a time of widespread societal fragility.

The pandemic exposes the country’s history of racist policing. And police bias could harm already vulnerable black communities.

Black communities are already disproportionately challenged during the coronavirus pandemic. Data from the CDC as of April 20 (albeit incomplete; racial demographic info has not been reported for many patients) shows that about 34 percent of Covid-19 patients are black. That’s despite black people making up only about 13 percent of the country’s population.

The same trend is bearing out in available city and state data: In Chicago, where black people are just 32 percent of the population, 55 percent of the city’s Covid-19 fatalities were deaths of black people, as of April 21; in Detroit, black people make up 78 percent of the population, and have had 75 percent of Covid-19 deaths, based on information available on April 22.

These statistics reveal what has been the larger lesson in the pandemic: The coronavirus pandemic is amplifying structural inequality and bringing to greater light the fact that racism along with its bedfellow — deep poverty — has left black people with underlying health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, and more) that are risk factors for the disease.

Now, one of the few practices that could potentially save more black lives — wearing masks — could create the opposite effect. In early April, when the CDC first recommended that all Americans wear face coverings in public, black men were quick to express hesitation: wearing face coverings would intensify racist perceptions of criminality, especially to police. In essence, black men have to pick their poison — risk their lives (and the lives of others) to Covid-19 by not wearing a mask, risk their lives to police officers who see them as suspicious while wearing a mask, or some tragic amalgamation of both.

“These alarming reports highlight the fact that racial biases — implicit or otherwise — don’t cease, and in some ways are heightened during a national crisis”

Their fear and enterprising coping mechanisms (some men are turning to printed and bright-colored face coverings) are not without reason. In likely every measure of the criminal justice system, from arrest figures to incarceration rates, black people are overrepresented. At the root of the disparity is the longstanding belief that blacks are America’s crime problem. From slave patrols to Jim Crow to present-day policing, racism has motivated the country’s interpretation of crime, leading America to value punishment (incarceration) over prevention (working with the community). And law enforcement culture continues to act on these beliefs, whether covertly or overtly.

“There’s a very long and disturbing history in many locations where police are seen as an intimidating presence rather than a support to black communities,” Marc Mauer, the executive director of the criminal justice research and advocacy nonprofit The Sentencing Project, tells Vox. “It is counterproductive for public safety because these communities are less likely to have trust and confidence in police and less likely to report crime.”

According to Mauer, the distrust exists because of policies rooted in discriminatory policing, like stop-and-frisk, in which officers stop and interrogate people on the basis of “reasonable suspicion.” According to data from the American Civil Liberties Union of New York, in 2011 — the peak of stop-and-frisk in New York City (more than 685,000 stops were recorded) — black and Latinx people made up 87 percent of those stopped by police and 88 percent of those stopped overall were deemed innocent of suspected crimes. Two years later, a federal judge would rule that the policy was “indirect racial profiling.”

Stop-and-frisk is just one of many reasons why black people have come to distrust law enforcement. In a pandemic, fears of being profiled and stopped may force them to forgo key safeguards like wearing a facemask or calling on police for help. Plus, wearing a face mask may lead to more stress that comes with being a perpetual victim of racism. In turn, stress exacerbates the aforesaid Covid-19 risk factors; then comes death.

“Before the pandemic, there was always this issue of implicit bias with police officers and quite frankly with everyone — criminal defense attorneys, prosecutors, and judges — in the criminal system,” says trial attorney Kobie Flowers. According to Flowers, who took on police brutality cases as a former civil rights prosecutor at the DOJ and now sues police departments for wrongful conviction cases, implicit bias is only going to be amplified by the pandemic.

“Implicit bias is a shortcut our brains take to make decisions when we have to make thousands of decisions. But if you’re unaware of how your brain is operating, you can make bad decisions,” Flowers told Vox, adding that the pandemic, with everyone already on edge, is a recipe for a lot of bad decisions.

In the case of traffic stops, Flowers points to a Stanford University study of data from 2015 that found that blacks are more likely to be pulled over and searched for illegal substances than white Americans. This is because of implicit bias, Flowers says, not because black drivers are more likely to be carrying illegal substances. “Now add people wearing masks. My experience, rooted in empirical evidence, suggests that bad decisions by law enforcement due to implicit and even explicit bias will only get worse [during the pandemic].”

And since black people fill many essential worker roles, they can’t just hide at home. (Not that home is safe for black people in the face of law enforcement.) “If you’re at the bottom of the economic ladder, you can’t afford to stay home,” says Kami Chavis, a professor and director of the Criminal Justice Program at the Wake Forest University School of Law. “Black and brown people are the home health aides, the food workers, the sanitation workers who take public transportation and are at greater risk of exposure,” she added.

Plus, the combination of being shamed and treated like scapegoats and a lack of access to medical care spells disaster. Nationwide, black people are more likely to be uninsured than whites.

Chavis tells Vox that the stress on poor marginalized communities will be met with the pressure that officers are facing. “Twenty percent of officers [in New York City] have Covid-19. Why? Because they are face-to-face with people, doing hard work and morale is low,” Chavis says, which can lead to officers lashing out and exhibiting violence.

So far, the reports of racial profiling are anecdotal and there are just a known few. But did the incident occur if it wasn’t caught on camera? Shelter-in-place orders might be limiting the presence of public watchdogs. “One of the greatest advances in police accountability hasn’t been a police body camera or surveillance; it’s the people filming,” Chavis says. “People react differently when they know they’re being watched.”

Anti-bias training would be a small step in trying to prevent racist profiling and Covid-19 deaths

While the senators called on the nation’s top law enforcement officials to provide anti-bias training, the training, if implemented, might not make even a small dent.

As Flowers points out, black people have perished at the hands of police departments that had already been engaged in anti-bias training and working on bolstering community relations. “Even with training, you still had [the shooting of] Tamir Rice. Even with training, you had [the death of] Freddie Gray,” Flowers says.

“There’s a very long and disturbing history in many locations where police are seen as an intimidating presence rather than a support to black communities”

Doubling down on anti-bias training is a start, but preventing more black deaths amid the Covid-19 pandemic will take a culture change. “As with any job, there are written rules, the do’s and don’ts. But then there’s also a culture that isn’t written down — people will engage in certain behavior regardless of what the training says because of a job’s unwritten culture,” Flowers tells Vox. “Until you have that change requiring officers to look at their jobs as guardians of the people — not warriors against the people — the current police culture will continue to overtake any training and bad decisions will continue to be made.”

Greater transparency is a step on the way to culture change. Similar to the recent national push for Covid-19 data disaggregated by race and ethnicity, there must be a push for regular information about coronavirus-related arrests by race and other markers like socioeconomic status. Mauer says we must question how police agencies might be defining crime differently right now. For example, if someone is arrested while wearing a mask, or for not wearing a mask, we must first understand how police departments are identifying this as a crime.

“Agencies must review what their practices are and define what they are charging people for,” Mauer says. “They should review statistics on a monthly basis and disseminate the data. If there seems to be disparities that emerge, they need to determine whether it reflects actual patterned behavior or patterns of law enforcement. And they must engage with leaders in the black community.”

For Chavis, changing culture is ultimately about investigating people’s values going forward — and rethinking who should join the police force in the first place. “We need to be careful about who we give a badge and a gun to,” she says. “We need to know their education level and their psych profile. We need to be more careful with what we’re asking them to do.”

"['Nicole Dieker', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Money Talks: The couple making it work during coronavirus layoffs,"Welcome to Money Talks, a series in which we interview people about their relationship with money, their relationship with each other, and how those relationships inform one another.

Ryan and Julie (not their real names) live in Los Angeles and work in the entertainment industry. Ryan, 39, just got laid off from his second temp job this year; prior to his most recent layoff, he was earning $18 an hour. Julie, 32, is a writer’s assistant on a popular network show and earns $16.50 an hour with a 60-hour guarantee and overtime built in. Julie has a union job with benefits and protections; Ryan just filed for unemployment.

The following conversation is lightly condensed and edited for clarity.

Ryan: I haven’t picked up a show since February 2019 [his last assistant job]. If I were working on something with multiple seasons, you’d work a season and you’d have some time off. You could pick up other gigs, go on unemployment, and after two to three months the show would pick you back up and you’d be working again. I found a couple temp jobs, but I got laid off from both of them.

Julie: I started working on my current show in November. When we are working, we have the illusion of consistency — because if you are in a writers’ room or on a show, those are gigs that tend to last at least 20 weeks, if not nine months at a time.

What’s really tough about this current situation is that the people who are in Ryan’s boat, who were depending on the short, couple-day or couple-week gigs, all of that work is gone. I’m lucky in that my work continues, writers’ rooms are still going, but that’s the only thing that can still happen because you can do that remotely. I know some people in post [production] who are still working, but basically everything else had to completely stop.

Executives are fine, the people I know who work at studios are still working because you can do that remotely, but the people who are actually making the stuff — all of those people are in big trouble. Networks are taking this opportunity to bank scripts, but we can’t film new material while this is happening, and there is a real possibility that we might run out of material [for viewers to watch/stream].

Ryan: We’re home together all day long. We have a two-bedroom apartment, so we have a roommate who lives here as well. We’re very lucky because we have a decent-sized place. Our total rent is $1,900 split three ways, so we hit the jackpot. It’s very cheap compared to everyone else we know.

Julie: Our 1,200-square-foot apartment, which is palatial to most people, has now become all of our home offices.

Ryan: We’re spending a lot more on food than we usually do. In the entertainment industry your lunch is always covered.

Julie: I went from having lunch, if not breakfast and lunch, and all my snack food coming from work, to having to feed myself. It’s a strange adjustment.

Ryan: [We’re spending] next to nothing on gas. We try to, once or twice a week, order something to pick up from our local small restaurants to keep them supported, but we’re not going out to eat very often.

Julie: Ryan and I work in a big money industry and make very little of it. We’re paycheck-to-paycheck, honestly. We’ve got a couple months’ cushion before we’re completely screwed.

A thing that’s been oddly good about this, which is not really the word I should be using, is that our student loans automatically went into forbearance. That’s $500 a month that I can put towards the credit card debt we built while we were unemployed for seven months.

Both of us are paying less for car insurance, paying less for various bills, I think one of my credit card companies has offered some sort of interest reduction thing. Ryan is on unemployment.

“Ryan and I work in a big money industry and make very little of it”

Ryan: I’ll be making more on unemployment than you will working 60 hours a week. When my payments start up I will probably get $450 a week. [Under the CARES Act, which includes a $600 weekly expanded unemployment benefit] I’m not sure how the $600 works, but if it’s each week, I’ll be getting $1050 a week.

Julie: I personally believe that speaks more to how underpaid I am in general. I think we’re in this pocket of people — and it’s true of a lot of people — before, we were underpaid Hollywood assistants. Now, everybody is getting the help that we’ve kind of always needed.

We were so on the edge of financial ruin to begin with, that I’m actually able to take this time and pay off debt in a way that I couldn’t before, since we have the money we’re saving on student loan payments and Ryan’s supplemental unemployment. We had a very large vet bill back in January that we hopefully will be able to pay off before the credit card interest hits 28 percent.

Ryan: We have two cats. One of them started breathing kind of funny, so we took him into the vet and they sent him to an emergency animal hospital. His lungs were filling up with fluid. He was on constant oxygen for two weeks, and it got to the point where we were financially going to have to start considering maybe letting him go, and then he started getting better. Then he got sick again, and then he started to get better again.

Julie: It ended up costing us $15,000.

Ryan: If we had known that would be the total cost, our cat probably wouldn’t be with us right now. But because of the incremental nature and the rollercoaster nature of how he kept getting better and then getting worse again … basically we both took out new credit cards to cover the costs. We also did a GoFundMe and raised $6,000, which helped a lot.

Julie: Our credit cards came from CareCredit, which is a stopgap credit plan for pet emergencies and things like that. We’ve already been able to pay off one of the cards with the help of friends and family, and the other one is six months interest-free. That’s the one we’re trying to go after, because once the six months are over, it jumps up to like 28 percent interest.

Neither of us have great credit. I recently paid off my car entirely, which helped. But last February, we both were out of work at the same time, and although we had jobs here and there and were on unemployment, I didn’t get another full-time job until October. Our credit card debt in general just sort of went back up, and that’s extremely common for people at our level in this industry. We’re paid fine when we’re working, but we don’t have a lot of protection for when we’re not.

Ryan: You’re also not paid well enough when you’re working to cover yourself when you’re not.

Julie: Basically you pay off your credit cards when you’re working, so when you’re not working you can run them back up. When our cat got sick, we were just at the place where we had started to even back out again, and then we got the surprise bill.

Ryan: I also have $250,000 in student loans to pay off.

Julie: And I’m near that. I’d have to look. I hate talking about our debt. It’s like you think you’re doing okay, and then you look at the numbers, and you think, “Oh God, maybe I’m not.”

I’m in an interesting situation because I should be able to stay at my job for a while — and there’s both opportunity and precedent for me to get promoted from assistant to staff writer. The difference between what an assistant gets paid and what a staff writer gets paid is enormous. Union minimum for staff writing jobs is $4,000 a week, which is four times what I’m making. If that were to happen, even if Ryan is making no money at all, I’ll still be making double what we’ve ever made before.

Ryan: I’ll be your house husband! I’ll clean and cook.

Julie: That’d be great!

It’s already harder for people to find work because of smaller writers’ rooms and so on. Ryan was on a network show for four years, and when he went on hiatus he didn’t look for work because he knew it would only be two or three months before he went back to a job. Now, when you do a season of a Netflix show, it can be a year before the room starts up again. Those assistants and those writers, the people at the same level we’re at, they have to find another job to fill the year. Finding writing jobs is hard, and finding assistant jobs in writers’ rooms is even harder. In my room, there are 10 writers and one of me.

A fear I have when this all ends is that, since everyone is out of work right now, everyone will be looking for work at the exact same time.

Ryan: This is a big scary gray area for me right now. It’s been over a year since I’ve been able to find a job in the part of the industry that I’m trying to work and move up in. My biggest fear about all of this is that, for the next show I get hired on, I’m still going to be a writers’ PA — that’s the person who gets coffee and snacks and lunch for everyone — and I’m not going to move up. It’s frustrating to have a master’s degree in screenwriting and spend four years as a glorified coffee delivery service. It’s possible to go from where I am right now to becoming a well-paid writer, but there’s no way to know.

Julie: It’s the strangest thing — for most people in our industry, this aspect is not new. This is happening to everybody at the exact same time, but this was always happening to everybody in a slow churn. Because [this kind of financial uncertainty] is now happening on such a giant scale, the national response is able to help us in a way that we always could have used, I suppose.

"['Maryellen Stewart', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Most people dying from Covid-19 are old. Don’t treat them just as statistics.,"I know to stay 6 feet away from others, to leave my shoes at the door, to tip like a Rockefeller on deliveries, and that I can take my temperature with a meat thermometer. I’d been briefed on preventative measures for the coronavirus, but I knew nothing about emotionally preparing to grieve.

My grandfather died on April 6, 2020, from Covid-19 complications. We knew his nursing home, one of the best in Connecticut, was in lockdown. We knew he had a fever and was sleeping all the time. He wasn’t swallowing anymore, his chest rising and falling rapidly. The average respiratory rate is 12-20 breaths per minute; my grandfather was taking 50. We knew his mouth was cracked, that his skin was irregularly colored, and he was letting go. My mother considered taking her car there and just sitting in the parking lot to feel close to him. Mercifully, the final stages happened fast.

There are thousands of Americans dying from Covid-19 every day. Most of them are elderly and immunocompromised, but you almost wouldn’t know it from the headlines. A young, healthy person dies and it’s an injustice, a scare tactic that gets shared on social media with a reminder to stay home. But when it’s a frail senior, well, their time was up. My grandfather gets to be a glossed-over statistic, a data point.

My grandfather, Werner Joseph Meyer (originally “Meier,” but he changed it to seem more American), was born on a dairy farm in Buchs, Switzerland. He had nine brothers and sisters and a 6th-grade education. He served in WWII. He tended bar and sold Electrolux vacuum cleaners door-to-door. After emigrating to America, he opened a restaurant, The Village Bistro in Fleetwood, New York. My grandfather loved classical music, Clams Casino, and gardening. He was legendary for having the nicest cameras but taking the worst pictures. He obsessed over making lump-free mashed potatoes and finding the perfectly shaped Christmas tree.

The news was delivered to me over FaceTime. I was alone in my living room in New York City, the epicenter of the virus, sheltered in place, my sobbing reflection staring back at me while I held my phone up. Grieving in self-isolation is one of the most unnatural things I’ve ever experienced. My grandfather had no funeral, no eulogy, no closure. He was a man of faith, but there was no priest at his bedside to administer last rites, no full-color double-sided prayer cards. He was cremated because the morgues were at capacity, and as it was, the body was likely too contagious to embalm. There wasn’t enough notice to purchase an urn, and the crematorium was sold out. My mother went to pick up my grandfather’s remains and received an 8x10 box in a reusable tote bag.

Working through grief is an isolating process, but it’s somehow even lonelier with my world shrunk to a 500-square-foot apartment. It’s in my nature to ask for some space, but now all I have is space. There were traditional observances we missed out on, but I was robbed of the comforting rituals, too: going through boxes of my grandfather’s old photos, yelling to my sisters in the other room for waterproof mascara, having a “take your mind off it” dinner with friends where everything felt normal again for one night. Instead of finding solace through support and human connection, I “went” back to work the next day and tried to live with the loss. I got burned out from answering sympathetic text messages. I took a government-approved solitary walk and cried openly on the sidewalk, my face mask drawing a curtain around me. It was all so anticlimactic that some days I forget he’s even gone.

This aggressive virus is making us confront the reality of death every day, but our culture doesn’t sensationalize the elderly and immunocompromised fatalities like the younger ones. The bias is pervasive and insidious, their lives seen as expendable. It’s this idea that underscores the push some politicians are making to reopen the economy sooner than most public health experts are recommending — that the economic costs are not worth the deaths of some elderly people.

With my grandfather, Alzheimer’s had started to show itself years ago and we accepted he was nearing the end of his life. That doesn’t make his passing any less of a tragedy. He wasn’t sick, and he wasn’t ready to die. There were 11 other fatalities at his nursing home, alongside countless stories and tens of thousands of families like mine who were bracing for the worst and had their lives upended. These are real people. They deserve that recognition, too.

May my grandfather experience a shred of dignity in his remembrance that he was not afforded in death. Later this year, my family and I will have a “celebration of life” to honor his 90th birthday. Those who are gone live on in our actions and emulations, so we’ll serve the silkiest mashed potatoes and somehow manage to not get a good photo of anyone. Finally free to gather in the physical world again, we’ll get the chance to say goodbye.

Maryellen Stewart lives in Brooklyn, New York.

"['Courtney E. Martin', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,The lessons we should really be teaching kids in the pandemic,"The words “Zoom call” now slip off of my three-year-old’s lips as easily as “birthday party” (and she loves to disinvite people to her birthday party right now, me included). My six-year-old, meanwhile, throws her scooter to the side outside our front door and runs straight into the bathroom to wash her hands. Kids adapt fast. Much faster than their parents.

America’s parents — particularly my peers of the white and privileged variety — seem not to be adapting in the face of this coronavirus crisis, so much as attempting to schedule our way out of it. The homeschool porn on social media — the elaborate charts, the explosive science fair projects, the Facetiming with all manner of experts — telegraph to the world that even a deadly flu can’t get in the way of our family’s achievements. One mom sent me a schedule she devised for her kid that includes a timer so she can switch academic subjects every 15 minutes. Her kid is five years old.

I’m here to say stop the madness.

People are dying. Particularly black people, low-wage workers, and those who have been historically neglected by our health system and pummeled with our racism. Our emperor, President Trump, has no clothes. Now is the time to push aside the elaborate academic schedules and teach our kids something more lasting about humanity.

There’s never been a more necessary time than now to teach our kids about systems and structures. Bleary-eyed adults are looking at predictive models late into the night on their laptops and trying to explain them the next day over Cheerios. Instead of shying away from this, lean into it.

You might understandably be thinking, “But my kid is four years old. She thinks Daniel Tiger is actually talking to her. How am I going to explain redlining to her?”

Of course, there are developmentally appropriate ways to talk to our kids about race and class, among so much else. But too often, white and privileged parents let ourselves off the hook in moments like these, justifying our silence with the notion that these concepts are too complex and can wait. Professor and parent Jennifer Harvey, author of Raising White Kids, writes: “Our children can and do understand racism much earlier than adults give them credit for.”

So simply asking a four year old, “Who are you noticing are the helpers in this moment?” in a nod to Mr. Rogers’s classic message, could be a very fruitful question.

I promise that having a genuine, searching conversation with your kid about what constitutes an “essential worker” will have a far more lasting effect than grabbing the Caviar delivery from the porch and getting back to the geometry lesson as the driver speeds away. For an older kid, you might ask: “Who is still working outside the home? Why? How are they being protected or neglected by other people — their neighbors, their employers, or the government? What does this all have to do with the fish taco we’re about to eat?” In other words, don’t forget the climax of the lesson: complicity.

As civic advocate Eric Liu put it, “The moral question that comes with flattening the curve is not just whether I’ll do my part to stand six feet away or stay at home. The deeper moral question is: How can I change at least one system of power around me?”

In other words, we should be learning lessons during this time that go beyond logistical distancing measures and ways to replicate our pre-pandemic lives. These lessons are also bigger than “We’re all in this together,” which is the equivalent of our Boomer parents’ well-intentioned, but inadequate lessons about being “color-blind” to racism. Epidemiologically speaking, we are all in this together. But when one lays our historic and economic profile over our epidemiological one, it becomes very clear that not everyone is exposed to an equal risk here. Those in dense urban centers, those who depend on public transportation, those who work in low-wage, unpredictable jobs without enough protections or adequate health insurance — these are the Americans most “in it.”

That’s not because they didn’t shelter in fast enough or wash their hands enough times. It’s because we live in a country whose story is riddled with redlining, the undervaluing of care, and the long tail effects of slavery.

So follow your kid’s lead. They’ll start asking all the right questions if you let them look up long enough from their Zoom lessons to do so. On a whim, I asked my six-year-old, “Do you have any questions about the coronavirus?”

My usually slow processing, quiet girl didn’t skip a beat: “Where did it start? How does it spread? How does it end?”

Well, dang, someone has been listening. Of course the kids are listening. And they are making meaning out of every piece of news you share. We spent some time researching, and then I did what educators would call “scaffolding” — I built on her questions to ask her some more: Who do you think is most and least likely to get the coronavirus? Why might that be? Who is most likely to get the care they need in response? How could we change that?

If you’re worried about your kid falling behind, you’re not alone; in a recent Pew survey, 64% of parents said they were. But we can’t let our fear of short-term academic FOMO overtake our motivation for long-term, collective justice. Your kid’s success, as turns out, is dependent on our collective health. It’s time to start acknowledging that interdependence, to ourselves and our kids.

So if your kid emerges this summer from the cocoon of your nuclear family newly sophisticated about power and how it flows, you will have done something profoundly important — not just for your kid, but for this country. Even more, if your white and privileged kid understands that they aren’t the center of the universe, that there are limitations on what resources they should be consuming, that they can fight the very forces their ancestors seeded and be a part of healing this country’s moral wounds, they might emerge healthier themselves. They might have the muscles, not to cling to schedules and control in times of crisis, but to ask and act on the hard moral questions of our time.

"['Emily Guendelsberger', 'Apr']",2020-04-15,The essential worker revolution of 2020 will not wait,"Part of the Pandemic Issue of The Highlight, our home for ambitious stories that explain our world.

Human societies fall somewhere on a spectrum, with individualism on one end and collectivism on the other. The collectivist end could be summarized as, “We’re all in this together” — think propertyless Indigenous tribes that share everything — and the individualist end by Margaret Thatcher’s famous declaration that, “There’s no such thing as society; there are individual men and women, and there are families.” It could also be summarized as, “You’re on your own.”

American identity is deeply rooted in individualism and freedom, in Protestant settlers’ belief in a personal, one-on-one relationship with God and the American Revolution’s nominal ideals of a land where all men are created equal and the lowest-born can rise to the top by their own merit. Our heroes are rugged cowboys, Randian übermenchen, Horatio Alger boys pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, college dropouts starting up companies in garages, good guys with guns. They don’t need help. They’re self-reliant. Most of all, their heroics are solitary. They’re alone.

As the self-quarantined would be able to tell you, being completely on your own isn’t generally a good feeling. It’s bad enough when life is normal, but the pandemic is giving the non-wealthy a raw, undiluted taste of what “there is no society” really means. It means poor people can die an “honorable death” in service of the economy. Workers in “essential” jobs, which tend to be hourly and poorly paid, are risking their lives and those of their family members for $12 an hour, $10 an hour, $7.25 an hour.

Now these “essential workers” — the cashiers and health care workers and bus drivers and elder-care aides and sanitation workers and cable guys and Amazon warehouse pickers, who for years have been told by their paltry wages and benefits and lack of dignity at work that they’re unskilled and utterly replaceable — are being lauded as heroes for risking their health to keep the country running. For most of them, it’s a choice between taking that risk or their families being evicted.

You can bet that these chronically undervalued workers are having a common experience right now that’s unprecedented in American history: the simultaneous realization that all of their bosses are more than willing to trade their lives for money. And workers are starting to question why, if they’re so essential, their lives and paychecks are so cheap. They’re realizing that they’re the foundational Jenga blocks, without which the tower would fall. The “essential” designation is a blueprint for which workers, if they got together and withdrew at the same time, could completely topple the country.

The idea that every man is an island has, through neoclassical economics, shaped monetary policy around the world since the 1970s. The theory is that each individual is a rational actor, making rational choices in rational markets; in an evolution-like process, these market forces naturally result in an equilibrium where things get better and better. If a job is bad, for example, workers will leave, and the boss will have to improve conditions or pay better if she wants anyone to work for her. Workers and bosses, producers and consumers — they’re all equal, with equal amounts of power in the market. It’s a cold, pure equation, a natural set of checks and balances.

In this every-man-an-island, free-market view, government intervention inherently does more harm than good. As President Ronald Reagan put it in 1986, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’” It’s a largely bipartisan sentiment — even President Clinton proclaimed that “the era of big government is over” in his State of the Union address a decade later. For the world to operate efficiently, we’ve been told, it must be a constant Hobbesian “war of every man against every man.” Every man must be an island. It’s just how things work.

Americans tend to look at big societal problems and see only individualist solutions. Look at the comments on any article about recent work stoppages in Amazon warehouses or fast-food chains, advising workers to improve themselves and find a better job if they don’t like the one they have. Or the idea that the best thing to do if you don’t like the way Amazon treats their warehouse workers is to stop buying things from Amazon.

Chronically undervalued workers are having the simultaneous realization that their bosses are more than willing to trade their lives for money

I recently wrote a book that’s critical of the company, and I sometimes get asked why it’s listed on Amazon, or (often sheepishly) if it’s bad to buy my book through Amazon. The answer is that it doesn’t matter. Amazon and other business titans are just too big to be affected by individual consumer choice. It’s like a gnat biting a kraken. The only thing that could rival the power that corporations have amassed is everybody in a country speaking together, as the voice of government, saying, “We’d prefer that workers not be treated this way.”

The coronavirus pandemic has made the enormous flaw in individualism glaringly obvious — individual workers are clearly not the equals of these monstrous, sprawling companies, no matter how much Uber or Instacart may claim that its drivers are just tiny little companies themselves. The only way for workers to have a voice that’s audible in the halls of power is to come together in the giant Voltron of a union.

And even more than that, humans just aren’t designed to be alone. We’re deeply social animals who became the planet’s dominant species specifically because of our capacity for empathy, cooperation, and generosity with one another in hard times. For the vast majority of human history, we lived in bands without private property. “We’re all in this together” is so deeply embedded in our DNA that, in a true emergency, it immediately overwhelms hundreds of years of individualist ideology.

Consider your gut feelings about the guy who bought up 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer to sell at a markup online. Or about business and thought leaders who almost immediately started floating the idea of sending people back to work ASAP, a plan that would sacrifice thousands of lives to appease the economy as directly as if they tossed thousands of people into a volcano to appease an angry god. Or the initial plan for coronavirus relief that was stingy to people who made less money to incentivize workforce participation.

Those are pretty natural extensions of the “every man is an island” idea, and not out of step with the governing ideology of America. In normal times, they wouldn’t have made headlines — Hand Sanitizer Guy might have even been praised for being an entrepreneurial go-getter. But in the context of a crisis, people almost unanimously reacted with disgust and horror.

Hand Sanitizer Guy immediately became what the New York Times called “a subject of national scorn,” getting a flood of death threats and hate mail. Even Republicans didn’t have the stomach for that early relief bill. And even the most out-of-touch opiners quickly learned to keep their mouths shut about their idea that grandparents would happily die for the sake of the next generation, or that sometimes you just have to sacrifice some people to keep the economy running, or their near-religious obsession with preventing “underserving” people from accessing government benefits.

This is what “no society” looks like, and it’s not just ugly — it’s a death cult. There are no free-market solutions to a pandemic. There’s no free-market answer to climate change, or homelessness, or the rise of new germs that shake off our old antibiotics. If there’s no society, there are no solutions to humanity’s looming existential problems. There’s only the grinning skull-face of eat-or-be-eaten capitalism mouthing, “You’re on your own.”

But American workers are starting to remember the power of togetherness.

Every year for the past few years has had a record-breaking number of strikes and walkouts. And it’s coalescing into something we haven’t seen before this pandemic, like the organized walkouts at multiple Amazon warehouses and fast-food franchises simultaneously. There was even a work stoppage by Instacart shoppers and drivers who, like all gig-economy workers, are independent contractors not technically allowed to collectively bargain.

The idea that profit motive and self-interest are the only possible fuels for society’s gas tank is deeply flawed, and those flaws have rarely been as glaring as they are now. It’s absolutely possible to move away from a fanatical devotion to individualism without ending up as a totalitarian communist state. There are plenty of countries around the world that don’t treat free-market capitalism as a god — in fact, the US is almost alone in our worship of it. And we’re handling this pandemic worse than any other country because of it.

The US must start to question whether “there is no society” is a particularly effective philosophy for running a society, and where we’d like to be on the spectrum between “every man is an island” and “in this together.” Because if you ask American workers, most actually would prefer to not be an island. Just ask yourself what’s scarier to hear right now: “I’m from the government, and I’m here to help,” or “You’re on your own.”

"['Nick Rahaim', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,I walked out of rehab and into a pandemic,"After more than 15 years of chasing oblivion in a bottle, I knew it had to end. So I checked myself into rehab on February 21. The plan was to dry out for 30 days, get out of rehab, find an Alcoholics Anonymous group, connect with a sponsor, and hopefully end the vicious cycle of drinking, regret, depression, and more drinking.

But come March 22, when my 30 days were up, I found the world to be vastly different from what it had been when I had entered rehab — empty streets, bare shelves at the grocery store, and people more afraid of others than usual. All I had learned of the terms “shelter in place” and “social distancing” while in a rehab center in California’s Santa Cruz Mountains was from the local daily newspaper and short calls from a payphone to my loved ones on the outside. But I had no idea what I was in for.

Once discharged, I realized how the beginning of my sobriety would go: no hugs from friends and family, no AA meetings in church basements, no dinners at my favorite restaurants. These things I had clung onto as bright spots as I faced my life after rehab were now gone. Then there were the classic triggers that cause people to relapse — isolation and economic insecurity, which have been now amplified to levels most of us have not seen in our lifetimes.

“This is the worst possible time to get into recovery, there is not a doubt about it,” Dr. Paul Earley, president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, told me over the phone.

There are around 20 million people with substance addiction disorders in the US, according to federal data. Combined with the 14,500 addiction treatment centers in the country limiting and changing operations due to the coronavirus pandemic, there are likely thousands newly cut off from the support they seek.

The pandemic has created unique challenges for many groups of people, and painfully exacerbated existing disparities. But for those of us fighting addiction, it’s especially scary. The collapse of the normal support structures has made building new patterns, habits, and community exceedingly difficult.

“I was trying to think of how this could be worse, maybe a war situation,” Earley said. “But the isolation and loneliness people are facing now is about as bad as it could get.”

Fresh out of rehab, I was ignorantly confident in myself. But after three weeks of isolation, I found myself parked outside a liquor store for 30 minutes, debating whether or not I should enter. I eventually did.

Looking toward sobriety

I’m 36 years old, and after years of being a full-time journalist, I’m now a grad student who spends summers working in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to earn money for tuition by fishing salmon. I still pay my monthly bills through freelance journalism and contract writing gigs, and I’ve always been a productive drunk, but boozing every night has made two jobs and grad school all very difficult to sustain. Hangovers bled the night into the day and have often made unaware bosses and editors perplexed with the inconsistent quality of my work and my failure to meet deadlines. My romantic relationships fell apart over and over again.

After years of failing to meet my professional expectations, a string of failed relationships, and a history of substance misuse on both sides of my family, I started cognitive behavioral therapy with a psychologist to begin to address my problems. One thing became painfully clear earlier this year: I couldn’t make the positive changes I needed while continuing my relationship with alcohol. So, I put my life on hold and sought help finding the tools I needed to fully address my drinking and shortcomings.

Recovery is difficult and all too often bound toward failure. As someone new to sobriety, I’m in no position to talk with any authority on how to be successful. But as someone working toward a new way of living, I know how hard it is to stay away from addictions in the midst of the public health crisis we now face.

Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were a big part of my plan to be a part of a larger community during this newly sober stage of my life. Like most of life these days, AA and other 12-step meetings — of which there are an estimated 66,345 groups and 1,361,838 members across the nation — connect on Zoom. Local AA groups, including those in my hometown of Monterey, California, have adapted to quickly move normally scheduled meetings online. Facebook groups and webpages have popped up to allow people to join meetings happening across the globe at any time.

I tune in a few times a week on my laptop from my studio apartment. Most who attend the online meetings seem elated to see the familiar faces of their allies in recovery. While they are all welcoming to a newcomer like myself, and I have felt comfortable sharing that I am fresh out of rehab, it’s still hard for me to connect with them on a personal level as a new face on a computer screen.

There is something missing from the in-person meetings, where I’m told that connections that bleed into after-meeting conversations build the early bonds of establishing a support network. And this is not only an excuse for why my attendance is well short of the recommended 90 meetings in 90 days for people new to sobriety, and why I’m not even close to finding a sponsor to help guide me through the 12-step and early sobriety.

“This is the worst possible time to get into recovery, there is not a doubt about it”

Earley, who himself has 36 years of sobriety, agrees that making first connections with one’s potential support community remotely is a difficult endeavor. Video conferencing tools are best suited for people who have an established rapport with each other, he said.

“Access to therapy and support networks is the glaring problem right now,” Earley said. “Everyone needs human closeness, especially for those in early recovery, and that is lacking in a video conference. It’s inherently more difficult for people to connect and feel safe.”

Nikki Soda, the membership development officer for the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers, sees similar challenges in getting people plugged into support networks after rehab.

“You don’t get all the tools needed for recovery by interacting through a computer, you build a foundation through the conversations before and after meetings — those parking lot conversations when you speak with someone one-on-one,” Soda said.

While Covid-19 is a more immediate public health concern than addiction, alcohol misuse alone affects 15 million people in the US and leads to 88,000 annual deaths, according to federal data. And that’s not even counting the other public health crisis that hasn’t gone away during the pandemic: the 2 million Americans with opioid addiction, leading to nearly 47,000 overdose deaths in 2018, according to the most recent federal data. Relapse, especially for people who use opioids, can easily lead to death, but those with addiction are more at risk for contracting and dying from Covid-19 because they are also more likely to be homeless, incarcerated, or have other physical ailments, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Earley and Soda have both seen the majority of intensive outpatient facilities move to virtual treatment. Access to services has tightened even as treatment providers try to do their best in a difficult situation. People have to unlearn habits and change attachments, they said. Yet sheltering in place often isolates those with addiction in triggering environments.

The struggle is not over

In the parking lot at the liquor store, I gave into my urges, walked in, and bought a six-pack of beer and a pint of Seagram 7 whiskey — the brand my dad drinks daily. It wasn’t planned. The walls of the small apartment I live in by myself felt like they were closing in on me. While I had a few social distance outings with friends, not being able to see anyone regularly was making me start to crack.

This isn’t the way the initial draft of this article ended, but I’ve stayed sober in the days since. Building routines has always been difficult for me, but doing so while trying to stay sober feels like improv jazz — sometimes harmonious, sometimes dissonant. I tune into AA meetings over Zoom, I talk to my therapist by teleconference, and I’ve tried to establish a daily mindful meditation practice as a way to fight against my self-destructive impulses.

But my situation is still precarious. People with addiction are already more likely than not to relapse, let alone during a pandemic where we’re forced to physically separate. Some of the people I became closest with in rehab have already fallen into a full relapse. What scares me the most is my rehab friends and acquaintances with opioid addictions — they are reentering society only to find isolation, and the comfort of their next dose could be fatal.

These aren’t easy times for any of us, and for those looking for sobriety in these uncertain times, Earley has some advice: “I want people to have hope that if the struggles seem greater than normal, this is not a normal time, so it’s not the time to be hard on yourself.”

There are many like me who decided to change their lives at a time when the world itself was undergoing rapid change. It’s a struggle, but on the flip side, the timing couldn’t be better — sheltering in place would be a terrible circumstance to be in active addiction. I feel much better going through it sober than drunk, and that alone gives me hope.

"['Catherine Kim', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,It took a pandemic for cities to finally address homelessness,"In early March, as Covid-19 cases began to surface across the country, activists were warning that the virus would wreak havoc within homeless populations. Now, more than a month after shelter-in-place orders have been in effect in most major cities, the numbers have proven activists right.

In mid-April, New York City announced there were 460 positive cases and at least 27 deaths among its homeless population of more than 60,000. In San Francisco, an outbreak in a shelter led to more than 100 positive cases, 10 of them staff members. In Los Angeles County, a majority of the coronavirus cases among the homeless — of the more than 30 so far — are from those who live on the street.

“We had near-record homelessness before this began,” said Giselle Routhier, policy director for the Coalition for the Homeless in New York. “We still have that homelessness crisis now as new people become homeless as a result of the pandemic.”

A pandemic poses a daunting situation for people who lack stable shelter, access to proper hygiene, and basic food supplies. Whether they live in shelters or on the streets in tent camps, there’s no way for them to practice social distancing to slow down the spread of the virus. The inequities people face has only gotten more prominent since the pandemic, said Jennifer Friedenbach, director of San Francisco’s Coalition on Homelessness.

“The very visual impact of wealth disparity that homelessness brings to the table has [been magnified],” she said, “because we’re talking about municipal governments asking everyone to shelter in place and they have thousands of people without an ability to shelter in place.”

As the threat to public health increases with every Covid-19 case, federal and local governments have taken some steps to address the needs of the homeless. The Trump administration is distributing $3 billion in aid to create emergency shelters and expand testing and treatment for these people. And cities are finally taking the advice of homelessness activists to expand shelters to unorthodox locations such as hotels and community centers.

While these are significant efforts, activists say it might already be too late. It’s taken a pandemic for officials to finally confront the issues of homelessness — and allocate the money and resources for solutions — and even then, many cities delayed action until there were finally confirmed outbreaks within shelters.

Many of the initiatives these cities have put forward are short-term solutions. After the pandemic passes, homelessness will continue to affect individual and societal well-being without a push for more affordable housing, providing rent assistance, or simply offering the houseless a home. The urgency of the issue will likely increase as more people lose their jobs due to the recession triggered by a nation-wide lockdown, Friedenbach said.

“As economies are getting devastated, we need billions of dollars poured into rent assistance, rent vouchers, construction of new housing, all of the different policy interventions to create housing specifically for people who are homeless and are extremely low income, so that we actually have that housing available to them moving forward beyond this,” she said.

Cities are addressing the issue of homelessness by improving hygiene, expanding shelters, and providing alternative housing

Several areas, including New York City and Los Angeles, have put some resources toward keeping the homeless population safe and sanitary. Cities have been installing portable toilets and hand-washing stations around encampment centers, and medical professionals have begun to make visits to educate these communities on preventing Covid-19.

There’s also a race to expand beds for the homeless to address the issue of housing. Santa Clara County in California, which has seen a 30 percent jump in homelessness from 2017 to 2019, built three additional shelters to alleviate crowding issues and provide more space for social distancing.

More cities are also converting buildings that aren’t in use during the lockdown to house people. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley announced that he’s turning convention centers into homeless shelters, including the Northern Kentucky Convention Center, which houses as many as 75 people every day. A library in downtown Spokane, Washington, has opened its doors to about 100 people a night. More than 20 local agencies teamed up to build a 49-bed shelter in a gym in Lansing, Michigan.

But these shelters still make people vulnerable to the spread of the virus because of the lack of walls and ample space, so officials are now turning to hotel rooms as a solution. It’s an effort that is being led by California: Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has managed to house more than 4,000 people in hotels so far. He’s also announced that the state was on its way to acquire 15,000 hotel rooms total to house people as part of his state-wide initiative “Project Roomkey,” which was established so that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would pay 75 percent of the housing fees to shelter the homeless. Other cities are now following suit, City Lab reports: Hotels in New York City are on track to house 6,000 people.

The number of these hotel rooms, however, covers only a fraction of the people in shelters and on the street, said Friedenbach. Even in San Francisco, only about 750 people are in hotels right now, which is about 8 percent of the city’s entire homeless population.

One of the most striking images in the pandemic has been the dozens of people sleeping within taped white squares on parking lot pavement, while more than 147,000 hotel rooms remained empty in Las Vegas. (A city spokesperson said hotel rooms are not a housing option for now.) And while the city has erected a tent complex in the same lot, its doors aren’t open to everyone: Only those that have Covid-19 or who show symptoms or were exposed to a person with the virus can claim a bed. As of April 16, only five of its 500 beds were occupied.

“We have not been happy with the Covid-19 response to house people,” Friedenbach said. “We feel that it’s been a double standard, that people in housing were able to shelter in place and that same opportunity was not allowed of unhoused people, even though they had empty hotel rooms sitting there.”

The half-measures taken by officials won’t do much to protect the safety of the homeless, Friedenbach said. Without drastic measures like housing all 9,000 members of the community — which she said hotels have the capacity to do — the homeless community will remain vulnerable to the virus.

“We need to get real and wake up [and realize] that we’ve got over a million men, women, and children who have no place to call home, and we are forcing them to live without water, to not be able to wash their hands, without access to bathrooms, and our primary response is criminalizing them,” she said.

Long-term solutions are needed to combat the rise in homelessness

The expansion of shelters and alternative housing has been the primary response from cities to protect the homeless. These initiatives, however, won’t do much to address the long-standing issue of homelessness in the US. They also raise the question: Why did it take a pandemic for cities to find solutions to their homelessness crises?

Ultimately, homelessness should be addressed by the federal government, advocates say, and not be left to local governments to solve alone.

“The homeless crisis across the country is caused by the lack of funding at the federal level,” Friedenbach said. “And so it’s not really fair to put homelessness on local municipalities ... because it goes back to divestment from housing at the federal level and then a series of bad policy decisions and inaction.”

There were drastic cuts to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s federal housing assistance in the ’80s, and federal support for the homeless has remained meager ever since. The Trump administration has further tried to roll back funding for HUD and demanded work requirements for those who receive public housing subsidies, all in the name of helping the homeless achieve “self-sufficiency.”

But homelessness will only grow in the US as people continue to lose their jobs as the economy shuts down because of Covid-19. So far, more than 22 million people have filed for unemployment, and 31 percent of tenants in the US did not pay their April rent at the start of the month.

Michael Banghart, executive director of Renaissance Social Services in Chicago, said a multi-part solution is necessary to both prevent further homelessness while solving the existing problem — something that can only be done with additional funding from the federal government. Despite the current eviction moratorium placed in many cities, many people will not be able to pay their rent once the pandemic passes, and officials need to be ready to provide rental assistance to groups that are on the brink of homelessness, he said.

“There’s going to need to be some substantial funding that goes into the prevention of people losing their units. So when evictions are back on, we need to make sure that we can help people catch up,” Banghart said. “There’s research that shows that giving people a little bit of support can save a ton of money in the long run from them ending up in homelessness. Homeless prevention works. And it’s going to be a question of whether it’s resourced or not.”

Related Giving housing to the homeless is cheaper than leaving them on the streets

Ultimately, solving homelessness means increasing affordable housing: building more public housing, providing more housing vouchers, and investing in bringing down rent. The benefits of providing secure, long-term homes for families through rental assistance are already documented, said Vanderbilt Prof. Marybeth Shinn, who wrote a book about the importance of permanent housing called In the Midst of Plenty: Homelessness and What to Do About It.

“If families just get access to housing that they could afford that was secure over the long term, they’re able to use it as a platform to change all kinds of other aspects and improve other aspects of their lives,” she said.

There’s also the option of giving homeless people a place to live for free, which has been proven more successful and cost-effective than leaving them on the streets. It’s already worked in Utah: Their chronically homeless population, which was nearly 1,932 people in 2005, dropped to a “functional zero” in 2015 after they made the decision to simply provide these people with houses. As a result, the state has saved about $8,000 per person because they’re less likely to use public resources from being hospitalized or jailed, or frequenting shelters.

The current situation is ripe for an increase in housing for the homeless, too — if the government is willing to make the investment, Friedenbach said. A number of hotels will go under due to the pandemic, some of which may already be housing the homeless, and the government could buy these buildings to house the community while also providing an economic stimulus, she said. It’s the kind of expenditure the government has shied away from making up until now, but she said she’s hopeful this time will be different.

“I think that this woke a lot of people up, and they’re starting to think about how intimately connected they are to their brothers and sisters out on the streets,” she said. “How the welfare and well-being of another member of our community very directly affects our own well-being.”

"['Li Zhou', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,How the coronavirus is surfacing America’s deep-seated anti-Asian biases,"There’s been a surge in harassment toward Asian Americans in recent weeks: According to Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that’s been tracking self-reported incidents, more than 1,100 physical and verbal attacks against Asian Americans have been documented since late March.

The high number of reports, which have been submitted over just two weeks, is especially striking since people across the country have predominantly been sheltering in place. The incidents — logged through the Stop AAPI Hate website, which launched on March 19 — are wide-ranging.

In one, an Asian American child was pushed off her bike by a bystander at a park. In another, a family at a grocery store was spat on and accused of being responsible for the coronavirus. For some, including one Japanese restaurant owner, the harassment has come in the form of vandalism.

Among these reports, which come from 46 states, there are notable patterns: women were more likely than men to say they were targeted, several incidents involved children, and harassment was more likely to occur at retail stores and pharmacies now that people in most states are sheltering in place.

“So many of us have experienced it, sometimes for the first time in our lives,” says Manjusha Kulkarni, the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, the group that helped set up this tracker. “It makes it much harder to go to the grocery store, to take a walk, to be outside our homes.”

Such incidents are taking place as the US grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, and as President Donald Trump continues to stoke xenophobia by using a racist name for the virus and associating it with Asian Americans. In a tweet last Thursday, Trump appeared to equate Chinatowns in American cities to the country of China, criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for promoting businesses in Chinatown after he restricted travel from China earlier this year.

The latest uptick in racism, however, isn’t just fueled by the pandemic. Although the uncertainty of the outbreak — coupled with the president’s rhetoric — has amplified it, this prejudice is rooted in longstanding biases toward Asian Americans that have persisted since some of the earliest immigrants came to the US generations ago.

“I think the recent surge is [driven by] the rhetoric that political leaders have been using ... but I don’t think we would have seen the spike in anti-Asian bias without a pretty strong foundation rooted in the ‘forever foreigner’ stereotype,” says University of Maryland Asian American studies professor Janelle Wong.

The “forever foreigner” idea Wong references is one that’s been used to “other” Asian Americans in the US for decades: It suggests that Asians who live in America are fundamentally foreign and can’t be fully American. Enduring tropes that have associated Asian Americans with illness and the consumption of “weird” foods, which have reemerged in relation to the coronavirus, are among those that play into this concept.

The revival of these stereotypes and the recent spike in harassment are having a pointed effect: they’re forcing a reckoning about the existence of anti-Asian racism in the US.

The current xenophobia is built on deeply rooted racism toward Asian Americans

Racism toward Asian Americans goes back a long time.

In fact, it was enshrined into law when some of the earliest generations of Asian Americans were immigrating to the United States in the 1800s. The Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, two of the country’s first immigration laws, were designed explicitly to bar Chinese American laborers from entering the country because of widespread xenophobia and concerns about workplace competition.

These laws — along with others that made it impossible for immigrants to reenter the country if they visited China — were among the earliest that tagged Asian American immigrants as foreigners who didn’t belong in the US. “Whereas in the opinion of the Government of the United States the coming of Chinese laborers to this country endangers the good order of certain localities within the territory thereof,” read the first lines of the Exclusion Act.

In addition to limiting immigration, the act guaranteed that Chinese Americans could not become US citizens for decades. “Very early on in the history of this country, Chinese Americans were seen as a group of people we wanted to keep out,” says Yale sociology professor Grace Kao.

And immigration policy wasn’t the only place where such discrimination was apparent. As illnesses including smallpox and the bubonic plague spread in the late 1800s, San Francisco’s Chinese residents were repeatedly used as “medical scapegoats,” according to San Francisco State public health researcher Joan Trauner.

When the city grappled with a smallpox outbreak in 1875-’76, for example, officials blamed the “foul and disgusting vapors” — and “unwholesome” living conditions of Chinatown — for fueling it, according to Trauner. Even after the epidemic continued following the city-ordered fumigation of all the homes in Chinatown, the blame persisted.

“I unhesitatingly declare my belief that the cause is the presence in our midst of 30,000 (as a class) of unscrupulous, lying and treacherous Chinamen, who have disregarded our sanitary laws, concealed, and are concealing their cases of smallpox,” city health officer J.L. Meares wrote at the time.

Similarly, when the city encountered cases of the bubonic plague in 1900, one of which was detected in Chinatown, San Francisco attempted to quarantine roughly 14,000 Chinese Americans who lived in that part of the city. At one point, city officials proposed sending Chinese residents to a detention camp where they could be cordoned off from other members of the public, though a circuit court rejected this plan.

In both cases, the vitriol toward Chinese Americans was driven by explicit racism, a fundamental lack of medical knowledge, and pushback toward the influx of Chinese laborers competing with white workers for job opportunities. Policy prescriptions were actively informed by assumptions that Chinatowns were a “laboratory of infection,” Trauner explains.

“A common trope in American popular culture was that the Chinese ate rats and lived in filthy, overcrowded quarters,” says Princeton University history professor Beth Lew-Williams. “In the 19th century, San Francisco routinely banned Chinese from public hospitals.”

The recurring association of Chinese Americans with the ideas of being “dirty” or illness-ridden is inextricably tied up with xenophobia — and as Nylah Burton writes for Vox, it’s an association that’s been used to “other” many people of color, including Mexican Americans and African Americans.

And now, because the origins of the coronavirus have likely been traced back to a wet market in Wuhan, China, where people purchase groceries, this information has renewed racist jokes and statements about the type of food that Asian Americans eat. It’s a sentiment that’s so common, it was a plot line of the ABC television show Fresh Off the Boat, when a young Eddie Huang, the Asian American protagonist of the show, is shunned after consuming his lunch in front of his white classmates because they see the noodles in it as “gross” and “nasty.”

This treatment of Asian foods is simply another plank of the othering of Asian American people: By deeming anything that’s different or unfamiliar as exotic or disgusting, the idea that Asian people are fundamentally foreign is further reinforced.

The effects of the “forever foreigner” trope, briefly explained

While the Chinese Exclusion Act was ultimately repealed in the 1940s, the racism it embodied played a central role in shaping how the United States continues to view Asian Americans.

The idea that Asian Americans are “forever foreigners” helped lay the groundwork for Japanese internment during World War II, when Japanese American citizens were sent to detention camps solely on the basis of their ethnicity, due to suspicions that they were abetting the Japanese government in some way. In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Islamophobia toward Muslim Americans and prejudice toward South Asian Americans was similarly fueled by assumptions that people were not loyal to the United States because of their religion, ethnicity and external appearance.

“It’s always easily activated, it’s very tenacious, it’s very familiar to many Americans,” says Wong of this assumption. “I’m sixth-generation Chinese American in the US and I still feel it.”

Because the hostility that Asian Americans have faced is rooted in this question of belonging in the US, some — including former presidential candidate Andrew Yang — have suggested that Asians can combat this prejudice by proving their patriotism and commitment to their community.

It’s a misguided argument founded on “respectability politics” that further puts the onus on Asian Americans to demonstrate how American they are — and it’s revealing of how much some people still think Asians need to compensate for looking “different.”

“Very early on in the history of this country, Chinese Americans were seen as a group of people we wanted to keep out”

Political pushback toward China, including its handling of the virus, has also been conflated with hostility toward Chinese Americans in a way that historic US tensions with Asian nations have been projected onto people of Asian descent in the past.

Recently, former Washington Gov. Gary Locke — who is Chinese American — was featured in a Trump attack ad against former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Because of the way it’s framed, the ad appears to imply that Locke, who once served as the US ambassador to China, is a Chinese official and not an American one.

“Asian Americans — whether you’re second-, third-, or fourth-generation, will always be viewed as foreigners,” Locke told the Atlantic. “We don’t say that about second- or third-generation Irish Americans or Polish Americans. No one would even think to include them in a picture when you’re talking about foreign government officials.”

Recent incidents are forcing a dialogue about racism

Although racism toward Asian Americans has persisted for generations, it’s rarely explicitly confronted or talked about. “Asian discrimination tends to be overlooked and widely tolerated, even among educated classes,” University of Pennsylvania English professor Josephine Park told Penn Today.

There are many reasons for this, according to Asian American studies scholars. Relative to other people of color, including black Americans and Latino Americans, Asian Americans have faced discrimination of a different degree. According to a 2017 survey from the Harvard School of Public Health, Asian Americans reported facing less bias in areas including housing, employment and criminal justice, compared to other minority groups.

Additionally, because of the diversity within the Asian American community — which includes more than 15 ethnic groups — there is a breadth of experience that isn’t always all the same. “It’s rare to see all parts of the Asian American community equally affected by an issue,” says UC Riverside political science professor and head of AAPI Data Karthick Ramakrishnan.

The toxic perpetuation of the “model minority” myth, which was introduced by sociologist William Petersen in a New York Times Magazine piece in 1966, has further complicated the conversation about Asian Americans and racism.

As part of his piece, Petersen pits minority groups against one another and argues that Japanese Americans were able to attain economic success in the face of injustice and discrimination in a way that other groups, which Petersen dubbed “problem minorities,” were not. It’s a fictitious argument that’s been used repeatedly as a “wedge” between minority groups, Kat Chow reported for NPR.

By branding Asian Americans as a “model minority,” writers like Petersen also sought to evade responsibility for systemic injustices that have disproportionately hurt black Americans. The proliferation of this idea ultimately reduced the visibility of racism against Asian Americans as well.

In the years since, the “model minority” myth has repeatedly been leveraged to obscure the diversity within the Asian American community — giving rise to stereotypes about Asian Americans as a homogeneous group that’s focused exclusively on studies and certain professions, like those in science and technology.

That emphasis on homogeneity, in turn, reinforces the idea that Asian Americans can be perceived as a monolithic group of people who can always be framed as outsiders. Comments like “Where are you really from?” or “Go back to your country” and jokes about how all Asian people look the same remain commonplace.

“The dominant culture’s belief in the ‘model minority’ allows it to justify ignoring the unique discrimination faced by Asian Americans,” writes Robert Chang, in his book Disoriented: Asian Americans, Law and the Nation-State.

Now, the recent rise in harassment is sparking a new conversation about the type of prejudice that Asian Americans experience. For some, it marks one of the rare times they are confronting this problem in such an explicit way.

“I haven’t been harassed for my race for years and years. It’s been a really long time, so it felt like it came out of nowhere,” California resident Julie Kang told Vox’s Catherine Kim.

Experts see these incidents compelling people to talk about discrimination toward Asian Americans more openly. “I think there is a newfound understanding for a lot of folks,” says Kulkarni. “We hope this will spur more dialogue and more action, frankly.”

Some also think it has the potential to improve solidarity between Asian Americans and other people of color, many of whom deal with racist harassment and violence — including from the police — on a regular basis. “I hope that we realize that this kind of process happens to other groups all the time,” says Ramakrishnan.

The response from some lawmakers has helped underscore this solidarity: A few weeks back, a group of House Democrats representing the black, Asian, and Hispanic caucuses unequivocally denounced anti-Asian rhetoric and violence.

“In times of crisis, it’s important for us all to stand together,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). “It’s particularly important for leaders of every race, every religion, every background to raise your voices as we are doing today to make it clear we will not tolerate anti-Asian rhetoric or violence against the community.”

The attacks Asian Americans are facing across the country are bringing the dialogue about longstanding prejudices to the fore. And as Americans are having more frank conversations about race and institutional biases — even as the president promotes xenophobia — they aren’t as easy to ignore as they have been in the past.

“Addressing ... these kinds of dominant stereotypes that are really pervasive, that are so easily activated, requires public education and the broader public committing to understand race in America,” says Wong. “There’s a way that it could be a really potent reminder that Asian Americans are racialized in the US and that we can’t go it alone.”

"['Anna North', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,The coronavirus pandemic has people rethinking their plans for having kids,"One of Jaquelyn Yeh’s patients ran out of birth control when the coronavirus pandemic hit.

She ended up going a week without the medication and having an unplanned pregnancy. Thanks to the economic crisis that has come along with the pandemic, she and her partner are both facing furloughs from their jobs. Yeh, a family medicine physician in Seattle and a fellow with the group Physicians for Reproductive Health, recently met with them via telemedicine to talk about whether they wanted to continue the pregnancy.

“Talking to them about options counseling has been very different,” Yeh said. “They definitely had to weigh their financial strains, which is something they didn’t have to think about a few months ago.”

Yeh is due to follow up with the patient and her partner this week to find out their decision. But whatever happens, they are just two of the countless many around the country whose reproductive lives have already been impacted by the spread of Covid-19.

Initially, shelter-in-place orders around the country gave rise to jokes about a “coronavirus baby boom” — based in part on research showing that births can spike nine months after certain disasters, especially those that require people to stay inside. But already, just weeks after many Americans were told to stay home, it’s clear that the effect of the pandemic on people’s decisions about children — and their ability to make those decisions — is going to be more complicated than that.

Some say the worldwide crisis has inspired them to try for a child. Victoria Insley, for example, told Vox that she and her husband had been trying to conceive but decided to put things on hold after she became unemployed last year. But in March, after about two weeks of social distancing, they decided to start trying again. In part, the pandemic made them realize that “life is short,” Insley told Vox. “We’re not getting any younger.”

But others are making the opposite decision. Clinics are reporting an increase in requests for birth control prescriptions, and providers of abortion medication are seeing increased demand as well, according to Nourbese Flint, policy director and manager of reproductive justice programming for the group Black Women for Wellness.

A lot of the reason may be economic. With millions of Americans newly unemployed and many industries all but shuttered, many families are deeply uncertain about their financial future — if they can even provide for the present. The fact that many child care facilities are currently closed and many people are cut off from their extended families may also discourage some people from planning for kids right now. “People make long-term decisions when they feel certain about the future, and they put off long-term decisions when they don’t,” Philip Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland who studies families, told Vox.

But the ability to make reproductive choices also isn’t so simple in the pandemic. Several states, such as Texas, have moved to restrict abortion, categorizing it as nonessential during this time. Meanwhile, some are having difficulty getting birth control because they’ve lost their employer-provided health insurance or because shelter-in-place orders mean they can no longer make a trip to the pharmacy without family members finding out, Flint said. And for people who do get pregnant and deliver during this time, the pandemic could exacerbate racial disparities already found in maternal health care.

Overall, when it comes to health care, the pandemic “has really shown our gaps and where we need to be better,” Yeh said.

The pandemic — and the economic crisis that comes with it — could change a lot of people’s thinking on having kids

It’s long been a popular assumption that when people are stuck at home with little to do, there’s a spike in pregnancies as a result. But evidence for that is somewhat limited, according to the New York Times. One study did find that low-severity storm advisories were associated with a slight uptick in birth rates, but more severe advisories were actually associated with a downturn. “If you’re running for your life, you’re not making babies,” Richard W. Evans, one of the study’s authors, told the Times.

And the pandemic is unlike any storm. While some people may be sheltering at home with their partners, some health care workers are actually self-isolating away from their families to avoid infecting them. And thanks to closures of restaurants, bars, and other businesses to slow the spread of the virus, 22 million people have filed for unemployment since March and the jobless rate is likely the highest it’s been since the Great Depression.

With millions of Americans newly unemployed and many industries all but shuttered, many families are deeply uncertain about their financial future

Unemployment tends to lower birth rates in the short term, Cohen said, and that’s likely to be the case with the current crisis as well. When it comes to having kids, “people who are unemployed or unstably employed or worried that they might lose their jobs are just likely to put it off,” he explained.

Some people may also be concerned about what being pregnant and giving birth in the coming year will look like. A lot of questions remain about the risks of the coronavirus during pregnancy — while it’s possible that the virus can pass to a fetus during pregnancy, for example, the effect on newborns appears to be mild. Meanwhile, circumstances for birthing parents have changed significantly, with hospitals around the country limiting visitors in the delivery room in recent months. It’s hard to predict what the picture will look like for parents-to-be nine months from now, but questions around medical care only add to the uncertainty people are facing when they think about expanding their families right now.

Concerns about the future of child care and school could also have an effect, especially for people who already have at least one child and see how the pandemic has upended their routines. With schools in all 50 states closed and many day care facilities shuttered as well, parents are in the position of taking care of their children at home and supervising online schooling, all while continuing to work if they’re still employed and potentially looking for work if they are not. That makes it difficult and stressful to take care of kids right now, and most likely stressful to contemplate expanding a family. “It’s hard to imagine people making the decision to have more children in the middle of this,” Cohen said.

There’s already evidence that some people are changing their plans in response to the pandemic. Black Women for Wellness has been hearing from clinics about an uptick in requests for birth control, Flint said. Meanwhile, Plan C, a website that offers information about getting abortion pills online, saw traffic double in March when many shelter-in-place orders were issued, Amy Merrill, the site’s digital director, told Vox. Traffic has dropped somewhat since then, but remains elevated above its pre-pandemic level.

And some abortion providers are reporting an increase in demand for the procedure, with some patients citing fears of giving birth during a pandemic. Some patients are saying “having a child right now isn’t best for them,” Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, told the Associated Press.

Overall, when it comes to having children, “a lot of people are rethinking their lives right now,” Flint said. “The world has changed very dramatically.”

Still, despite those changes, the pandemic has some people wanting to expand their families, even if now may not be the best time. Amy Klein, for instance, wrote recently at Insider that living under a shelter-in-place order made her wish her daughter had a sibling. “When I’m stuck inside, coloring or monitoring princess outfit change No. 537, or playing ‘hide and seek’ (mostly just ‘hide’ because sometimes I’m working and forget to look for her), my heart goes out most to my daughter,” Klein wrote. “At times like these, I feel we’re not enough.”

Insley, meanwhile, says she’s wrestled with the uncertainties of getting pregnant during this time. “I really feel for the moms who are in labor and delivery right now who are only able to have one person with them,” she says. However, she and her husband agreed that especially because they had already put off trying for so long, “now is the time.”

People are facing barriers to making reproductive decisions right now, whether it’s an abortion or IVF

Whether they want to conceive or prevent pregnancy, however, Americans are facing additional barriers thanks to the pandemic.

Hormonal birth control, for instance, may be more difficult to access right now for a variety of reasons. Though employer-based health insurance is required to cover contraception with no copay, many of those who lost their jobs in recent weeks lost their insurance as well, Flint said.

“It’s hard to imagine people making the decision to have more children in the middle of this”

And shelter-in-place orders bring with them new privacy concerns. Some people may not feel safe or comfortable telling parents, partners, or other family members that they are on birth control. And under normal circumstances, they were able to pick up their prescriptions without other family members finding out, Flint said — on the way home from work, for example. But now, with many people staying at home due to the pandemic, “if you’re stepping out of your house, there has to be a reason.” And people may have difficulty filling their prescriptions due to the added scrutiny.

Others may not want to go to a pharmacy to pick up a prescription for fear of being exposed to the coronavirus. Perhaps because of such fears, Pill Club, an online birth control delivery service, reported a 30 percent increase in requests to transfer prescriptions from outside pharmacies during one week in March.

Meanwhile, abortion has become more difficult to access in some parts of the country as states restrict the procedure during the pandemic. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, for example, announced in March that abortions did not qualify as essential medical procedures and ordered them postponed unless the life of the pregnant person was threatened. Last week, Abbott announced that other medical procedures could resume on April 22 but that the ban on abortions would continue. As a result of the ban, clinics in Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada saw a 706 percent increase in patients from Texas after the pandemic began, according to NPR.

But not everyone is able to travel out of state, especially now. When it comes to abortion, it’s likely that “there are a ton of people who need access who literally just can’t get it,” Flint said.

And those who do want to have a child right now face barriers as well. Fertility clinics around the country have been postponing in-vitro fertilization and other procedures during the pandemic, both to slow the spread of the virus and to conserve medical resources for the fight against it, Katherine Harmon Courage reported for Vox. That means many people dealing with infertility, as well as many LGBTQ couples who can’t conceive a child on their own, have had to put their plans on hold.

Meanwhile, those who want to visit an OB-GYN for preconception testing or to talk about trying to get pregnant may have a hard time doing so, since many such medical services have been postponed due to the pandemic. “If you’re trying to get a regular OB-GYN appointment” to discuss trying to conceive, Flint said, “it’s really hard to get that appointment, if not impossible.”

Prenatal care is also changing, with ultrasounds spaced out in some cases, and other services provided by telemedicine, according to the New York Times. And once babies are born, it can be hard for parents to get support from family or friends during a time of social distancing, which some fear could increase the risk of postpartum depression.

For people who do get pregnant and give birth in the months ahead, advocates are concerned that the pandemic could widen existing inequities. Black women already die in childbirth at three to four times the rate of white women — likely due to a combination of factors including discrimination by providers and chronic health conditions exacerbated by poverty — and the current crisis could exacerbate the racism women of color experience in the medical system, Flint said. Black Women for Wellness is starting to hear increased reports of pregnant people’s birth plans being ignored, she added. “In such a time where health professionals are not questioned,” Flint said, “there is even more space for abuse.”

Now and in the future, people are going to need support to build the families they want to have

The coronavirus pandemic came at a time when many Americans’ reproductive lives were already tightly constrained by outside forces. Preventing pregnancy has become more difficult for many low-income Americans in recent years as states and the federal government strip funding from Planned Parenthood and other providers of contraceptive care. Recent restrictions on federal family planning funds under the Title X program, for example, have led to a 46 percent reduction in that program’s ability to provide contraception to low-income and other underserved patients around the country, according to a study by the Guttmacher Institute.

Abortion, meanwhile, has become increasingly difficult and expensive across much of the South and Midwest in the last 10 years as states have instituted waiting period laws and clinic restrictions. Eighty-nine percent of Americans currently live in counties with no abortion clinic, according to Guttmacher.

Those who do want to have children have also run up against difficult economic realities and policies that make it hard to parent. Birth rates in the United States have been falling since the Great Recession, and many young people cite economic anxieties as the reason they may have fewer children than they would otherwise like to have. In 2018, Morning Consult and the New York Times surveyed young adults who had or expected to have fewer kids than they considered ideal: 64 percent cited the expense of child care as the reason, 49 percent cited worries about the economy, and 39 percent mentioned a lack of paid family leave.

Having the family you want to have, when you want to have it, is already a luxury in America, and the pandemic stands to make that even more true. The threat of the coronavirus has produced worry and uncertainty for everyone, but “that instability and insecurity that people feel is very inequitably distributed,” Cohen said. “The professionals who are staying home and working from home and the working-class people who are in front-line jobs of various kinds are just having a very different experience right now.”

As a result, low-income Americans may be even more likely than wealthier people to feel that they can’t afford to think about having kids right now. Yet they are also more likely to have a hard time accessing birth control due to job loss or reductions in federal funding.

To help people maintain contraceptive access during this time, some providers — and a number of online services — are offering birth control prescriptions by telemedicine. States are also asking the Trump administration to lift FDA restrictions so that medication abortions can be prescribed by telemedicine as well. According to Merrill of Plan C, “people all across this landscape are trying to understand, what can abortion access look like in the time of Covid and beyond?”

But telemedicine is another area where the gap between low-income Americans and wealthier people is painfully evident. “Not everyone has a smartphone” or internet access, Yeh said. “What we really need to do is be cognizant about those gaps and try to fill them.”

When it comes to feeling financially secure enough to have a child, meanwhile, policies that provide a safety net for parents — from an increased minimum wage to affordable child care — could be more necessary than ever during and after the pandemic, Cohen said. “Those things have always been good policy ideas,” he said. But assuring people that “there’s a floor below which you won’t fall,” he said, “that seems just really crucial right now more than ever.”

"['Danna Takriti', 'Apr']",2020-04-20,How Muslims are preparing to observe Ramadan during the coronavirus pandemic,"Last Ramadan, Asad Dandia broke his fast surrounded by friends, old and new, at the Islamic Center at New York University, a major community center that he’s been a part of for many years. As they broke their fast at sunset, Muslims from varying communities bonded over their shared meals.

“I use ‘communities’ in the plural because Muslims of New York come from all national, ethnic, social, and denominational backgrounds, and I consider myself blessed to be part of so many,” Dandia, a Brooklyn-born graduate student, told me.

But with most countries still in varying degrees of lockdown due to the coronavirus, Dandia and many other Muslims around the world will see a starkly different Ramadan this year. “With the ongoing pandemic, Ramadan won’t be the same. A lot of community activities will probably be curtailed, but the show must go on,” said Dandia.

The Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins this year on the evening of April 23, marks the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslims believe that during this month, the Quran — the Muslim holy book — was initially revealed to the Prophet Mohammed, and fasting during this month is one of the five “pillars” or core requirements of the Islamic faith.

During this month, from dawn until sunset, Muslims are expected to abstain from food, water, and any activity that is deemed sinful. People also tend to increase their spiritual activities, such as charity-giving, prayer, and the recitation of the Quran.

However, because of the worldwide instruction for people to stay at home to flatten the curve and to reduce the spread of Covid-19, many traditional activities during this month that involve group events and communal worship will not be able to take place or will have to take different forms, including moving online. Mosques around the world have closed in order to curb the further spread of the disease.

“If, God forbid, the pandemic continues during Ramadan, Muslims will not be able to pray Taraweeh [the nightly prayer during Ramadan] in the mosques,” Hassan Fawzy, an Islamic studies scholar who previously taught at Qatar University, told me. “Socially, people will be deprived of traditions like swapping dishes between community members, or hosting and attending any community gatherings,” he says, which are major aspects of Ramadan that have been practiced for more than 1,000 years.

Fawzy told me that, as far as he knows, it is unknown whether Islamic religious activities were ever affected this way in the past. “We do know that there have been major pandemics in the past, such as the Plague. However, we do not know what Islamic scholars or scientists did during that time in terms of managing group religious obligations such as prayer and worship,” Fawzy said.

“The mosques will be sad and thus our hearts will also be sad”

With Ramadan just around the corner, Muslims from the United States to Malaysia to the Gaza Strip are preparing for a dramatic shift in their normal Ramadan practices and activities.

In New York, the current epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, Asad Dandia told me that annual activities such as social justice campaigns and other community programs in which he usually partakes will likely get canceled due to the pandemic.

“With the ongoing pandemic, Ramadan won’t be the same. A lot of community activities will probably be curtailed, but the show must go on.”

“I always look forward to getting involved in these activities because I don’t think we can separate our personal spiritual development from being present among people and working to uplift them,” he told me. But this year, continuing these activities from afar may prove challenging and force Muslims to find new ways to maintain that sense of community.

In Kuala Lumpur, Faizal Hamssin reminisced about the sense of community that comes with Ramadan. “The Iftar feasts [breaking the daily fast] in Malaysia tend to be inclusive, in the way that it also includes friends who are of different religious backgrounds, eating together and enjoying each other’s company,” he told me. “During the second half of Ramadan, the bazaars and local vendors selling traditional Eid attires are usually very busy, it’s the best time to look for good once-in-a-year bargains.”

Recalling last year’s busy Ramadan festivities, Hamssin said he expects Ramadan will change this year. “There won’t be any Ramadan bazaars in most parts of the country this year, and if the Movement Control Order continues throughout Ramadan, there also won’t be any Taraweeh congregation prayers this year,” he said.

In the Gaza Strip, where a years-long Israeli blockade has left Palestinians who live there with scant access to medical supplies and aid, daily survival is already a struggle. Aya Saleem, a humanitarian and philanthropic activist in Gaza, told me that Ramadan usually brings joy to the people of Gaza as they begin preparing for a month of charity, family, and worship.

“But in 2020, because of the coronavirus, this will change. We won’t be able to pray Taraweeh in the mosque in fear of further spreading the virus. The mosques will be sad and thus our hearts will also be sad,” Saleem said. “We won’t be able to visit or host our families and friends, everything will be very difficult.”

“Perhaps the pandemic will bring us together in new ways we hadn’t considered before”

Although both religious and social group activities that occur every Ramadan will likely not exist this year, Fawzy, the Islamic studies scholar, says that doesn’t necessarily mean people can’t attain the same level of spiritual fulfillment they ordinarily would.

For instance, Taraweeh, he said, can be prayed at home. “Praying Taraweeh in a group inside a mosque is not obligatory; the Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, used to pray it individually.”

Fawzy suggests a different method of prayer for Muslim families. “A good alternative would be for families to create their own at-home prayer program. Fathers could, for example, lead the prayer at home — or even his kids if they’re old and capable enough.”

But a worry remains: Muslims, especially converts, who may not be surrounded by people who fast at home and therefore rely more heavily on community activities to get them through the month, will likely feel a sense of loss this year.

Dandia said that although that’ll likely be the case, there might be a silver lining: “As a community, we’ll be more conscious and intentional about how we serve our people. We’ll have to rethink what it means to remember and center the voices of those in our communities who’ve been pushed to the margins, who may not have Muslim families or a community to break fast with.

“Perhaps the pandemic will bring us together in new ways we hadn’t considered before,” Dandia said.

"['Khushbu Shah', 'Apr']",2020-04-17,The pandemic has exposed America’s clean water crisis,"Day after day, Deanna Miller Berry watches the requests pile up in her inbox.

“Please help me,” a resident of Denmark, South Carolina, pleads. “I’m stuck in my house and don’t want to drink the water.”

“Just water,” another resident writes in.

A third request for water comes in from a family of two who live in an apartment in the center of town on a block flanked by Baptist churches and not too far from the Piggly Wiggly. Miller Berry logs the responses to the dozen questions in an Excel sheet for the Denmark Citizens for Clean Water: Yes, someone in the home is directly impacted by Covid-19. Yes, someone has a disability. Yes, someone is elderly. No, neither one has access to their own transport.

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Miller Berry’s document keeps growing longer. As the founder of Denmark Citizens for Clean Water, she helps supply the community with clean water instead of the brown, smelly liquid that has been sloshing out of the taps in a number of homes for more than a decade. She delivers tanks and pays the monthly water costs — sometimes hundreds of dollars — for residents in the majority-black community.

The town’s battle with drinking water — laced with HaloSan, a pesticide meant to kill bacteria — long precedes the pandemic, though. Residents told a local outlet 10 years ago, “The smell is terrible.” More recently, former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer mentioned the residents’ concerns over their water system on the campaign trail.

Virginia Tech civil engineering professor Marc Edwards, who exposed the unsafe lead levels in the water in Flint, Michigan, and helped bring national attention to the issue, has also gone down to Denmark to test the town’s well at the request of the community. In 2017, he collected dozens of samples from homes, Miller Berry says, but when Edwards asked the town’s mayor if he could test a well for possible bacterial contamination after spotting a leaky sewage pipe, the mayor refused.

As for Flint, Mayor Sheldon Neely is still busy dealing with the community’s access to clean drinking water six years after large amounts of lead were detected. And now there is the pandemic. When Vox spoke with Neely a few weeks ago, he had declared a state of emergency before the president of the United States had, and had ordered water that was shut off by the previous administration reconnected.

Meanwhile, miles away in Detroit, lawyers and activists are also fighting to turn water back on for the city’s most vulnerable populations, after officials promised it would do so amid coronavirus concerns — yet hundreds still remain without access.

Having chemical- and lead-free water — or water at all — in the pandemic is vital: Hand-washing with soap is one of the most effective ways to fight off the virus. But millions of Americans across the country lack clean water — from small, rural towns in Kentucky to New Jersey’s densely populated city of Newark. And while clean water access isn’t only an issue for majority-black communities like Flint, Denmark, or Detroit, one study did find race to be the strongest correlative to lack of clean water. It is a crisis that is further exacerbated by the coronavirus, compounding years-long injustices in water-poor communities.

“It’s just a Catch-22,” Edwards tells Vox. “If [these communities] don’t engage in rigorous hygiene, they’re endangering themselves to coronavirus, and if they do, they’re fearful of the water.”

Communities without access to clean water are in a “constant state of emergency”

Contaminated water isn’t confined to a few communities or states, experts say. In any given year from 1982 to 2015, nearly 45 million Americans were accessing water that violated health standards, according to a 2018 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

While that may be true, the lack of water access impacts low-income communities like Denmark, Flint, and Martin County, Kentucky, more aggressively.

“That is a reality for our poorest Americans,” Edwards said, which “translates into a lot of problems. ... Cities that have a lot of water shutoffs. Others are living in fear of bathing and showering because of distrust in their water. And so even the basic functional water and quantity for hygiene isn’t being delivered.”

In Martin County, Kentucky, BarbiAnn Maynard, who has seen brown, milky water in her shower and kitchen for nearly two decades — when she does have water — waves off the collective panic around coronavirus.

“This is not anything unusual for us,” Maynard, a member of the Martin County Water Warriors, tells Vox. “I used hand sanitizer rather than our water” before coronavirus. She has been afraid to wash her hands for a long time, and the pandemic has changed almost nothing, she says. When she takes a shower, she uses antibacterial hand-wash.

The Martin County Water District operates in a “constant state of emergency,” the state’s Public Service Commission noted. A 2019 report from the Appalachian Citizens Law Center noted nearly half of the county’s residents couldn’t afford to buy water regularly. (The water department did not return Vox’s request for comment.)

Now in the pandemic, many of the grocery stores in the county are out of water, Maynard says. Donors paying into a fund for residents to buy water are still making contributions, but the only grocery store allowing residents to buy water at market value limits it to two gallons per person per visit. It takes an average of four gallons to get through the day, Maynard says. Before the pandemic, residents could make a 45-minute drive to a spring in West Virginia, but now they’re not allowed to cross state lines.

To work around the grocery stores’ rules, Maynard went directly to the bottle distribution center in Elkhorn City, Kentucky, more than an hour drive from her home, to buy cases in bulk.

But even before the coronavirus, Martin County needed more bottled and distilled water than other places in the US. “It’s just as bad inhaling it in the shower, so you have to get right back out,” Maynard says.

The threat of dirty, lead-infused, or chemical-laced water — and, in some cases, no water at all — is not only a rural concern. Last year, more than 23,000 accounts had their water shut off in the city of Detroit, and 37 percent still hadn’t had service restored as of mid-January. With the virus spreading, the city promised to restore water to residents, but as of March 31 had only done so for 1,050 of the 10,000 people who called with a water service problem (8,000 of those callers did not qualify for the Coronavirus Water Restart Plan, according to a city report).

Kristi Pullen Fedinick, the director of science and data at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, attributes the overlooked water crises across the country to governmental “policies that have led to specific communities being disenfranchised and marginalized.”

These dozens of communities across the United States, she says, have been facing not only water crises but many other issues because they have been systematically ignored for decades by those in charge. She ticks off the problems communities tend to face when they lack water: poor air quality, poor access to health care, and higher-than-average death rates. “The pandemic really exacerbated those issues they have been facing for a very, very, very long time.”

In Newark, New Jersey, for example, the state’s largest city, lead-contaminated water has impacted the health of its residents for years, with city officials denying there was a problem. In 2018, they abruptly changed course, however, and started handing out water filters to some residents after a new study confirmed that lead was indeed in the water at an alarmingly high rate, the New York Times reported. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to the mayor recommending the city advise residents “to use bottled water for drinking and cooking, until we can be assured of the reliable efficacy of filtration devices.” At the same time, the Newark Water Coalition provided hundreds of gallons of water and filters at its distribution sites pre-pandemic, to fill in the void of just how much water residents need.

But with the stay-at-home mandates in a hot spot like New Jersey, the coalition’s co-founder Sabre Bee says getting water out to those in need isn’t always possible when keeping social distancing in mind.

“We were doing [distribution] at church, but of course, we can’t gather in groups of five or more,” Bee says. “And so we haven’t been able to move distributions.” Instead, she and other advocates for clean water deliver water to older and ill people, those who cannot get around in the middle of a pandemic.

People are telling Bee they’re boiling water when they can’t get clean water, which she knows works with bacteria. But with lead, she says, that only concentrates the amount in the water.

“I know this is serious,” Bee says about the pandemic, “and I have to help my immune system during this time, but I’m drinking water that’s poisoned. So now I’m just a ball of nerves and feeling helpless and hopeless.”

Local water advocacy groups are stepping in to bring water to their communities

In 2018, the NRDC found that more than 30 million Americans, nearly 10 percent of the country’s population, drank from sources that violated the EPA’s federal regulations. The issue, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlines on its website, is that even though the EPA puts out regulations — like setting legal limits on contaminants in drinking water and regularly updating water standards — they are just regulations. There is no national standard that mandates states implement the EPA’s guidelines. This leaves a gap in local and state governments carrying out these guidelines, because in many cases, they may not have the financial resources to improve their drinking water.

“I’m just a ball of nerves and feeling helpless and hopeless”

As Edwards says, all the blame cannot be placed on small, local governments: “Many of our post-industrial cities and towns in America are losing population, and those who are left behind cannot afford to upgrade their infrastructure and maintain it to meet existing federal laws and standards. And so [those in charge] end up cutting corners because they have no choice.”

This leaves those communities at risk to take it upon themselves to find — and many times buy — their own clean drinking water.

In Denmark, Miller Berry has taken on the burden of helping those in her community. “We’ve gotten zero help from the state of South Carolina. We’ve gotten zero help from our county, and we’ve gotten zero help from our city officials. We are being ignored by all three,” Miller Berry says. (Multiple attempts by Vox to contact the mayor’s office went unanswered.)

She has paid more than 20 residents’ water bills over the past few months, according to her calculations, and word is spreading. These days, she gets more than 60 calls a day.

“I’ve been reaching out to the National Guard today to see if they could provide a water buffalo [tank]. But a [tank] cannot be provided to us until our county emergency management manager declares Denmark an emergency,” Miller Berry says.

This is a stark contrast to local governments that have stepped up in the pandemic. In Newark, construction workers have replaced more than half of the nearly 19,000 lead-laden pipes since 2019, according to Kareem Adeem, the city’s director of water and sewage. Filters that should last the better part of a year were passed out before the coronavirus outbreak to the residents who still have lead-contaminated water in their pipes, he said.

In Kentucky, Maynard can’t even finish her sentence when she talks about how people are supporting her community. “Getting donations right now is, oh, my gosh,” she says over the phone with relief. A state representative sent 60 gallons of distilled water for medical needs, while another Democratic state Senate candidate, Scott Sykes, sent 200 cases of water to residents, she said.

Even though it’s a massive public health threat, coronavirus feels like a blip to communities struggling with water, Edwards says. “There [are] many dimensions to this problem and [coronavirus] is a minor dimension, but it’s symptomatic of a frustrating situation that you can’t even rely on to get water from your tap.”

"['Catherine Kim', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,"If the US Postal Service fails, rural America will suffer the most","Since the coronavirus pandemic hit, the volume of mail delivered by the US Postal Service has drastically declined. Businesses have cut back on sending advertisements and bulk mail — the agency’s main source of revenue — leaving it on track to possibly run out of money by September.

To save its services, the agency is asking Congress for $89 billion. Democrats want to meet the USPS’s needs and ensure funding in the next coronavirus relief bill. Republicans, however, are seizing this as an opportunity to privatize the agency, an agenda they’ve been pushing for years. President Donald Trump is also on board, refusing to sign a new bill that includes funding for the postal service.

The president’s disapproval of the agency is well-documented. In the past, he’s pushed for service cuts in the fiscal budget and indicated that he wanted the USPS to raise rates for packages. However, these actions would have dire consequences for Americans, especially those below the poverty line who live in remote areas and rely heavily on the USPS for their mail.

The absence of the USPS would particularly affect indigenous people living in tribal lands, as there are already few resources dedicated to keeping them connected with the world, said Twyla Baker, of the Mandan-Hidatsa tribe in North Dakota.

“It would just be kind of a continuation of these structures in the US that already dispossessed people of color, black and indigenous people of color, and people below the poverty line,” Baker said.

The USPS is legally required to deliver all mail, to all postal addresses in all regions, at a flat rate, no matter how far it may have to travel. The service’s accessibility and affordability are especially important to rural communities that live in poverty and to people with disabilities, who can’t afford the cost of a private business to deliver their daily necessities. (In 2017, the rural poverty rate was 16.4 percent, compared with 12.9 percent for urban areas.)

And while some may argue that the USPS is becoming more obsolete as an increasing number of services are becoming digitalized, there’s still a large chunk of people who rely on mail because they have poor (or no) internet service. (The Federal Communications Commission estimates that 14.5 million people in rural areas lack access to broadband.) In fact, 18 percent of Americans still pay their bills by mail, according to an ACI Worldwide report; meanwhile, 20 percent of adults over 40 who take medication for a chronic condition get those pills by mail order, according to a survey by the National Community Pharmacists Association.

Then there are the several small towns around the country that vote only by mail because they’re not populated enough to open up polls. In Minnesota, for example, 130,000 receive a mailed ballot every election because they live in a town with fewer than 400 people.

“USPS isn’t just a public service,” Baker said. “It’s a lifeline.”

Companies like FedEx and UPS often don’t deliver to remote rural areas

The USPS is crucial to rural America because it is obligated by law to serve all postal addresses with no differences in the fees it charges. As required by congressional mandate, the agency ensures that all Americans are connected.

The USPS was never really meant to operate as a business but as a public service, which is why it’s been able to keep its prices lower than private companies. Businesses like FedEx and UPS don’t build offices in remote rural areas, like deep in Wyoming or in the mountains of Colorado, because it’s simply not profitable. They often rely on the Post Office for last-mile delivery; the agency delivers mail for them from major transportation hubs to the final delivery destination, often in secluded areas.

This ultimately means that without the USPS, FedEx and UPS won’t have the resources to deliver to remote rural areas, nor will they likely make investments to do so since they’ll lose money in the process. Instead, people will have to bear the burden of traveling to the companies’ offices in larger towns to meet their mailing needs. For Mary Meyer, who lives in Bucyrus, Ohio — a town with a population of about 11,000 — the closest UPS customer center is 16 miles away in Marion.

“USPS isn’t just a public service. It’s a lifeline.”

Meyer knows firsthand how heavily rural Americans rely on the Postal Service because she used to live in Findlay, the second-largest city in northwest Ohio. Because the area is more populated — urban enough to have a UPS store down the street — than Bucyrus, she had more options when buying daily necessities. Now, however, she needs to buy most toiletries for her special skin condition online, and her current location is so remote that only USPS delivers her parcels.

“The only store we have here is a Walmart. So for clothes or even like deodorant or toiletries that I need for my certain skin condition, or brands that are more eco-friendly that I prefer to use and support — they’re not an option here,” she said. “If USPS got shut down, what concerns me the most is that I would lose — not just me, but all of us — we would lose a valuable resource that is so integral to American life, especially in rural America.”

Meanwhile, Baker said some people in her tribe don’t even have a car to drive to the closest town with a FedEx, let alone can they afford the price differences in sending mail.

“It’s like a Catch-22: It costs money to be in poverty. It costs money in terms of time spent waiting for a bus. Time spent getting up earlier,” Baker said. “It costs extra money to use the for-profit services. It’s almost like a penalty fee for being in poverty. It’s so unfair, and frankly, it’s enraging.”

For the disabled and elderly, medication delivery is a crucial service

Accessing medication in rural areas can be a struggle when a town is too small to support a pharmacy. But for those who are disabled or elderly, physically filling prescriptions can be an impossible task — which is why many rely on the Postal Service to deliver their meds.

More than half the people who get their medicine delivered are over the age of 65, according to a report from the National Community Pharmacists Association — and 54 percent of this group takes more than four different types of medication. If the USPS shuts down, then they will be left without an affordable option to access vital drugs.

People with disabilities rely on the Postal Service to mail their prescriptions for similar reasons. Many simply cannot travel to the closest city, let alone leave their houses, to pick up their prescriptions. And a significant number of those who belong to this community are also veterans that have signed up for the Veterans Affairs’s “Meds by Mail” program, which delivers medications to their house. The shutdown of the USPS could ultimately disrupt the services of another government agency that serves a vulnerable population.

“It’s a real challenge, especially as you see a lot more local mom-and-pop-style pharmacies close down,” said Rebecca Cokley, director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress. “For a lot of people in rural America and people with disabilities, it does make it significantly harder to access medication.”

The situation will grow more dire if the pandemic goes on past September and the Postal Service does shut down, Cokley said. “The fact that the president is talking about closing Post Offices ... and the notion that people would now have to go out to their pharmacy, to their grocery store, instead of being able to stay home and access their medications from home, puts them at greater risk for contracting the virus,” she said.

If the Postal Service fails, rural Americans’ voting rights are at risk

The USPS also serves a crucial role in ensuring that everyone has a right to vote by delivering mail-in ballots to the most remote areas of America. Several states allow those in small towns to vote by mail so that they don’t have to travel miles to their polling area in larger cities. It’s played a particularly important role in rural areas where the population is growing older — rural communities have the largest share of people above the age of 65 — and is less mobile than younger generations.

John Koetzner, from Healdsburg, California, is one of the many people in the state who sends his vote in by mail because he lives in a remote area with no voting precinct.

“That’s probably the most important thing that I have going through the mail — my right to vote,” he said. “I use the Post Office to receive [my ballot] and to send it.”

Although it’s free for him to send his mail-in ballot (California has been providing paid-postage ballots for all mail-in voters since 2019), that could change if the Trump administration continues to remain indifferent to the agency’s financial woes. A FedEx envelope costs at least $8.50, which is 15 times more expensive than what the post office charges — a hefty price difference for both voters and state governments to accommodate.

The voting rights of indigenous people would particularly be at risk, Baker said, because they’ve already been dispossessed when it comes to elections due to restrictive voter identification requirements for in-person voting. In response to these constraints, Baker said her tribe had mobilized to encourage and help people sign up to vote by mail, since North Dakota provides no-excuse absentee voting. That could all fall apart, however, if access to affordable mail becomes obsolete.

As of now, there’s no sign that Trump will support any additional funding for the USPS. Congress did grant the agency a $10 billion loan from the US Treasury in the last coronavirus relief bill, but it’s a modest move considering that Democrats initially wanted to give it a $25 billion grant. In a show of support, people have been ordering stamps online and are encouraging others on social media to do the same to help save the agency.

Ultimately, the absence of the Postal Service could lead to major disenfranchisement among rural communities, Koetzner said, and that alone should be enough of a reason to support the agency.

“The most important aspect of being a citizen is being able to exercise our right to vote,” Koetzner said. “And having that stripped away by closing Post Offices would basically nullify our most significant right of all.”

"['Michael Waters', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,"Tips on how to cope with social distancing from people isolating in China, Italy, and US","Over the past few weeks, at least a third of the world’s population — including all of India, El Salvador, and most US states — have gone into lockdown. Their lives have been marked by ambient anxiety about paying rent and staying healthy, a newfound passion for baking, and — at times — boredom.

Few people are equipped to deal with long-term isolation like this. But while much of the world has only just begun home quarantine, residents of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Italy, and elsewhere have faced movement restrictions and isolation for multiple months now, some since mid-January. Meanwhile, some immunocompromised Americans have also self-isolated for months to protect themselves. Take it from these folks: While adjusting to a new at-home routine can be incredibly challenging, there are ways to make it work.

Vox spoke with people from across the world who’ve been isolating for months. For those in other countries, many of their anxieties felt different from those facing most Americans, about 12 to 13 percent of which are currently unemployed. Italy, for instance, has frozen layoffs, and South Korea boasts labor laws that make it hard for companies to fire people in large numbers. In much of China, life looked close to normal as far back as late February. Those sorts of protections are not available to the same degree in countries like the U.S.

So it makes sense that the people we talked to discussed playing word-of-the-day games with their kids, streaming live stand-up comedy sessions, and launching Zoom book clubs to pass the time. But they also spoke of the constant struggle of navigating child care and giving yourself space to mess up — Covid-19 is an unprecedented event in our lives, and there’s no one right or wrong way to handle it.

Interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.

“Take this day by day”

Miguel Xia, 25, a recent graduate currently in Hangzhou, China

Socially isolating since late January, but restrictions have eased up.

I was first quarantined just a day after the Lunar New Year when I was in Qingtian. On January 25, my family noticed an ambulance outside of our apartment building and a few people suited up in protective clothing. Turns out a lady living on the third floor had come back from Wuhan and had developed symptoms.

When the whole town was eventually put in lockdown, each house was given six passes to go out and get essentials. Each pass allowed a person to leave the neighborhood and go to the nearest supermarkets and back. I chose to let my family use the passes since they really wanted to go out to walk.

Time lost all meaning. I soon started sleeping at 6 am and waking up at 2 pm. I napped a lot, mostly to pass the time. We watched TV and kept up with the news, occasionally playing cards or mahjong. We’d play board games for a few hours, then watch TV, then cook.

The problem is, I actually live in Portugal. I just graduated with an engineering degree and went back to visit my family in Qingtian, outside Hangzhou. My plan was to go back to Portugal in February and then look for jobs in Germany or England. But obviously that didn’t pan out. Around that time, Europe announced that they’re going to cancel all inbound flights from outside of the continent. At the moment, I’ve started to look for potential jobs in China. I’m worried because I don’t have any friends here, and my Chinese language level is like a 6-year-old.

As someone who is still looking for work, my advice for quarantine is to do all the things that you needed to do but never had the time or energy. Organize your home, clean, practice a new language, call those old friends that you haven’t talked to in ages. They might also be in quarantine and be bored as hell, and it’s a good way to feel that everyone is in it together.

I’m a believer that mental health is affected by physical activity. Do something at home to work up a sweat, get the heart rate going. Get as much sun by the window as you can. Fresh air, too. And unlike me, try to keep a normal daily schedule.

I’m not as anxious as I could be about staying here because, in a way, China is a second home. But ultimately, it’s helped me most to accept my situation. I’ve pretty much decided that for the time being, I’m just going to stay here and look for an English-teaching job. I don’t know when I can go home. But focusing on the new reality helps me take this day by day.

“I think about three things I’m grateful for. It sounds really hokey, but after about a month I noticed that I sort of coaxed my brain into a more positive space.”

Nora, 25, an educator based in Beijing (currently in San Jose, California)

Has been socially isolating since late January.

Quarantine measures started in late January in Beijing, around the same time as Chinese New Year. I mostly stayed calm during the first few weeks.

I was used to being really busy, and it was nice to have some time to myself. I wrote, read, and did some painting, but I didn’t force myself to do anything. At night, I would go to my friend’s bar, which was closed to the public, and play games with him and a couple of other people. This was safe to do in Beijing because of the vast infrastructure that could be easily devoted solely to combating the spread of the virus. In order to ride public transport or enter certain public spaces, you have to wear a mask and not be running a fever. A security guard would usually take my temperature when I entered or left my residential compound or went to the store or got on the subway.

Helping others in my circle of friends take care of their mental health felt really good. When I felt worn down after about a month, my friends took care of me. We really banded together and created our own small community where we scheduled coworking days, small outings, or things we could do safely or via Zoom or WeChat calls.

However, I’m now stranded in the US indefinitely because of visa issues. China has closed its borders temporarily to foreign nationals and I’m in the Bay Area. Since people here don’t usually wear a mask and there’s less enforcement of directives, I find that I’m much more worried about actually getting the virus here than I was in Beijing, although I don’t advocate this approach for the US at all. I stay inside much more, and unless I need to go to the consulate or to go on a walk, I try not to leave my friend’s house whom I’m staying with.

Truthfully, I’m really worn down after about nine or 10 weeks of this, to the point that even my panic feels blunted. But what’s been helpful for me is to set up a sort of skeleton of a schedule, and then if I deviate from it, I don’t really punish myself for it.

I make sure to stay hydrated by drinking lots of hot water with lemon; the minor prep that goes into it keeps me grounded. My friend I’m staying with started a quarantine book club — we’re going to have a meeting on Zoom in a couple of days. I paint a lot more, and I listen to music to process my emotions.

Last year, before this virus, I started doing this thing where once a day I think about three things I’m grateful for. It sounds really hokey, but after about a month, I noticed that I sort of coaxed my brain into a more positive space. I still do it now and I think it’s been really helpful even despite my anxiety and a deeper preoccupation with illness and death. Once a day, I try to set aside some time to think about at least two people I know and think about what I appreciate and miss about them. Sometimes I tell them as much, sometimes I don’t. When and if I get to see my friends again, I will hug them very, very tightly, provided it’s safe to.

“My biggest piece of advice is to give yourself grace and just keep telling yourself this is not normal. This is a pandemic.”

Julie Cohen, a freelance writer in Sacile, Italy

Socially isolating since late February.

The weekend quarantine started, late February, there was a big Carnevale party. It’s a giant street party, shoulder to shoulder, and then the next day we essentially went on lockdown.

The first two weeks, school wasn’t open, but some restaurants were. My kids still had swim lessons, but they were trying to social distance at the pool. It was these ridiculous half-measures.

Finally, we were put on lockdown, which honestly was a relief. I think everyone was, in a way, like, “Okay, let’s get this moving. Let’s work on fixing this together.”

Now I have good days and bad days. My kids are 3 and 6, so they’re not easy ages. They take a lot of attention. It’s exhausting. My dream wasn’t to be a stay-at-home mom or a homeschooling mom. I don’t feel like I’m the best to give advice on “Try these six crafts.” Sometimes it can feel pretty overwhelming. Yesterday my 3-year-old emptied every single puzzle in the entire house into a laundry basket, like a puzzle soup. It’s just like that all day long.

Meanwhile, I had been trying really hard to keep my daughter up to speed with her Italian first-grade schoolwork, but now it looks like the kids won’t be returning to school this school year, so my drive to keep up with her reading and writing in Italian is getting less and less.

When I am looking for things to do or seeing what these other people are doing, I can start comparing myself and then I’m like, “Oh, why am I not great at managing my kids?” and, “Why are my kids not as independent?”

But I think that is just not helpful. If anything, my biggest piece of advice is to give yourself grace and just keep telling yourself this is not normal. This is a pandemic. Yes, we want to educate our kids. Yes, we want to keep them stimulated. We don’t want them to watch too much on screens. But at the same time, you have to keep yourself mentally healthy. You can’t beat yourself up.

“I’m just allowing things to change instead of responding with fear. Sitting with the change until it makes sense.”

Charis Hill, an activist and the co-creator of #HighRiskCovid19 in Sacramento, California

Has been socially isolating since early March

I have Ankylosing spondylitis, and I’m immunocompromised because of the medication. I was very nervous toward the end of February about leaving my house. By the first week of March, I finally quit all of that and started staying home except for emergencies.

Living with a chronic disease, I’m used to having a certain level of anxiety in my daily life. Chronic disease teaches you to adjust rapidly to new trauma. I’m professionally disabled, so I receive money from the Social Security Administration every month. Not enough to live on, but it is a constant.

Day to day, I’m intentionally not reading the news, not reading clinical research studies, because that’s not going to change how I live right now. Knowing more at this point isn’t going to change the fact that I need to do my daily self-care. I need to eat, I need to sleep, I need to survive.

Because of my chronic disease, I adapt in my normal life regardless of whether there’s a pandemic. So, with each new symptom in my body, I adapt to it. I think I’m approaching the pandemic in that same way, where I’m just allowing things to change instead of responding with fear. Sitting with the change until it makes sense.

I’m letting my anxiety tell me, “Okay, you need to rest now,” or, “It’s time to go outside and look at your plants.” But I’m also thinking about the future. When I’m going to have a potluck again or how I’m going to celebrate with people when they can be together again. Looking ahead in that way is helping a lot.

I’m even welcoming a stray cat into my house. It’s stressful, but it’s also good because it’s making me focus on nurturing a new thing. One way to adapt is to develop a new passion and give yourself permission to explore things that you never gave yourself permission to do before.

“We make events out of everything. Our kids are becoming real members of the household with their new chores and responsibilities.”

Jenna Pallio, an elementary art teacher in Milan, Italy

Has been socially isolating since early March

I haven’t left my apartment in weeks. My husband goes grocery shopping once a week, wearing a mask, and waits in line for one hour, sometimes two. I have two small children. Luckily we have balconies, so we just go out on the balcony. But they haven’t been out of the house in weeks, either.

I teach art, so I’m preparing video lessons and then I have one daughter who’s in kindergarten, so she has a program every day that her teacher sent her. I’m not that worried about losing my job because I am a teacher at an international school so I feel pretty secure in that. I do expect budget and pay cuts, but I think we will be okay. [Italy also has a freeze on laying off workers.]

I’m finding things I never thought would give me satisfaction now do. Like pizza night on Fridays are a huge deal. Or household chores that I hate. Because I’ve been home, I’m enjoying taking more time cooking and cleaning and organizing things, and also being okay with a huge mess at the same time.

We make events out of everything. Our kids are becoming real members of the household with their new chores and responsibilities. We tell them they are “helpers,” such as a lunch helper or a dinner helper. They started to mop our balconies and they love it.

We started doing “word of the day.” We’re making up games and jokes and routines to lighten up the day and make it fun for everyone. Last night we literally, like, drew faces on our chins and lip-synced songs together. I know it sounds crazy, but I feel so connected with my family and I do feel like we’re making memories.

"['Anna North', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,Coronavirus is causing a mental health crisis. Here’s how to fight it.,"Austin Hollinger has been dealing with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder for several years, ever since he was bullied at school. Now 19, he relies a lot on his friends to help him feel better day to day.

Hollinger is disabled and doesn’t drive, so his friends would often come to him. But with Alabama, where he lives, under a shelter-in-place order, most of them aren’t able to visit anymore.

“I’ve been very isolated,” he said, “which is not good for anyone.”

It’s a message many mental health experts have been sending in recent weeks, as millions of Americans face not just the spread of a new and dangerous virus, but also the measures necessary to stem that spread, which can cut people off from friends, family, therapists, and others who could ordinarily support them through difficult times.

As weeks of distancing turn into months, many people are experiencing a greater and greater sense of isolation. They’re also dealing with the uncertainty of when and how the pandemic will end, the fear of getting infected, the economic crisis that has cost millions of Americans their jobs, and the inconsistent messaging about the virus from authority figures.

“All aspects of life are affected” by the pandemic, said Arash Javanbakht, a trauma specialist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University. “It was like one day, everything changed.”

And many are concerned that the painful changes brought about by the coronavirus pandemic will cause a spike in mental health problems that could persist long after the most immediate threat of the virus is over. That’s been the case with other major disasters, like Hurricane Katrina, said Lisa Meredith, a senior behavioral scientist at the Rand Corporation think tank who has studied disaster preparedness. “It’s not just during the event,” she said. “People will be stressed afterward.”

Among people who contract Covid-19 and need to be hospitalized, experts expect to see high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Experts are also concerned about health care workers who are on the front lines battling the virus, sometimes without the appropriate equipment to keep them safe. A recent study of health care workers treating Covid-19 patients in China has already confirmed some of these concerns, finding considerable rates of anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms. As Laura Hawryluck, an associate professor of critical care medicine at the University of Toronto, told Vox, “health care workers are people too.”

And while the current crisis is stressful for everyone, people who already have conditions like anxiety or depression may be especially at risk, psychologists say. For people with anxiety disorders, for example, “any new stressor can make it worse,” Javanbakht said.

It’s possible to mitigate some of these effects now if those affected have access to treatment, mental health experts say. But that will require an expansion of telemedicine to make sure people can get therapy safely while socially distancing. And it will require policymakers and society as a whole to take the psychological impact of the pandemic, not just its threats to physical health, seriously.

The stress and isolation of living in a pandemic are taking their toll on Americans’ mental health

It’s safe to say that billions of people around the world are in a stressful situation right now. For many, life changed nearly overnight, with little time to prepare, Javanbakht noted. Some are now trying to work from home while caring for children. Others have been laid off or furloughed and may be worried about how they will pay their bills.

Meanwhile, people are getting a lot of contradictory information about the virus and the measures needed to combat it, Javanbakht said. While President Trump may say one thing, public health officials may say another. “It’s confusing and stressing,” Javanbakht said.

Feeling powerless in the face of such a widespread threat is common and real. “When we are dealing with a difficult situation, the more control we have, the less stressed we are,” Javanbakht said. But for many people right now, “the only control we have is to sit at home.”

The fact that many people are unable to see their friends and loved ones in person only makes the situation worse. “Social distancing is really hard on people, and it’s especially taking its toll on people who are isolated at home alone,” Meredith said. “Loneliness can be a big source of stress.”

Even under more normal circumstances, prolonged loneliness can contribute to depression and anxiety, as well as to physical health problems. One 2016 study, for example, found that being lonely was associated with an increased risk of stroke and heart disease. Today, the ordinary risks of loneliness could be magnified by the stress of living during a pandemic. For people who are social distancing right now, “there is a high risk that they’re going to become more anxious, much more depressed, and it’s going to have longer-term effects,” Rima Styra, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, told Vox.

Overall, a lot of people around the world are experiencing a dip in mental well-being. Factors from “looming severe shortages of resources” to the “imposition of unfamiliar public health measures that infringe on personal freedoms” are likely to increase emotional distress during this time, psychiatry professors Betty Pfefferbaum and Carol S. North wrote in a paper published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Still, while many people may experience greater feelings of anxiousness in the pandemic than usual, most who experience such distress will likely not develop a clinical mental health condition. “After disasters, most people are resilient and do not succumb to psychopathology,” Pfefferbaum and North wrote. “Indeed, some people find new strengths.”

But the pandemic does have the potential to trigger or worsen clinical conditions like anxiety and depression. And experts say that some groups of people are at especially high risk.

Health care workers, people who get sick, and those with existing mental health conditions could be especially at risk

One such group is Covid-19 patients themselves. Patients can experience delirium and agitation as a result of the virus, said Hawryluck, who has treated people with the disease. Being in an intensive care unit and using a ventilator, which requires medication that can increase confusion, can add to this effect. “We know that survivors from intensive care do have a lot of psychological symptoms” that match conditions from depression to PTSD, Hawryluck said. “I think it’s going to be higher in this population just based on what we’re already seeing.”

In addition to patients, health care workers are also at risk of the most serious mental health effects of the pandemic. “We share a lot of the same fears” as anyone right now, Hawryluck said — and health care workers may even be more fearful because they have seen the full extent of what the virus can do at its worst. They also must deal with the prospect of losing patients, and the task of delivering terrible news to families — often by phone, because the family members of Covid-19 patients are typically not allowed to visit hospitals.

On top of that, they face their own risk of infection because of shortages of protective equipment. And at the end of the day, “they’re still going home and self-isolating in the way everybody else is, so they have all of that impact as well,” Hawryluck said. Some health care workers are even more isolated than others, staying in hotels or even in their cars to avoid infecting family members.

The combined impact of these stressors could lead to mental health diagnoses and, in the long term, could cause people to leave the health care field, Hawryluck said: “I think, unfortunately, a lot of people will probably not necessarily want to continue in their career.”

A third group that could face added risk is those who had mental health conditions before the pandemic began. People with addiction, for example, may not be able to meet with their support groups or get access to medication-assisted treatment during this time, Meredith said. People with conditions like anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, or PTSD may find their symptoms worsened by the stress of living during a pandemic, Javanbakht said.

That’s doubly true if someone with an existing mental health diagnosis gets Covid-19. “We all need to be conscious of how scary it is for somebody to need to be admitted to hospital who’s got underlying mental health issues,” Styra, who has treated patients with the disease, told Vox. Even after they recover from the virus, “people with underlying illnesses are going to need a lot more help from their psychiatrists and their mental health teams,” she said.

Experts say without a major policy response, the mental health effects of the pandemic could linger long after the crisis has passed

Some mental health service providers are already seeing an uptick in people reaching out during the pandemic. Crisis counselors at the California-based nonprofit Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, for example, got 1,800 calls related to Covid-19 in March, up from just 20 in February, according to the Los Angeles Times.

And experts fear that, for some, the mental health impact of the crisis could last even after the pandemic — or, at least, its current phase — has passed. Even years after Hurricane Katrina, people in New Orleans who had been affected by the storm reported trouble going to work during hurricane season due to reactivated trauma, Meredith said. The SARS epidemic in 2003 also led to high rates of PTSD and depression among patients who had contracted the disease, Styra said. And research in Sierra Leone has found that people affected by the Ebola epidemic experienced high rates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms as well.

However, there are public health and policy measures that can help. One is more widespread access to — and insurance coverage of — telemedicine for mental health care. Many insurance providers have begun covering telemedicine during this time, and the Trump administration has announced that Medicare will expand such coverage to help reduce the need for seniors to travel to health care facilities where they could be exposed to the virus.

But coverage for telemedicine should continue long after the immediate crisis has passed, many say. “A lot of our patients have to drive 50, 60, 80 miles to get to a psychiatrist or a therapist for care,” Javanbakht said, an especially difficult task for low-income patients without reliable transportation or child care.

State and local governments are also recognizing the importance of offering remote mental health support. New York has announced an initiative to provide free phone or video chat support to people dealing with the mental health impact of the crisis, with more than 6,000 psychiatrists, psychologists, and other clinicians volunteering their time.

“We talk about the economic consequences, but we also need to talk about the social consequences,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said when he announced the program in March. “But the stress, the anxiety, the emotions that are provoked by this crisis are truly significant, and people are struggling with the emotions as much as they are struggling with the economics.”

Also crucial for mitigating the mental health effects of this crisis — and the next — is simple preparedness, Meredith said. For hospitals, having appropriate plans in place for allocating resources and housing patients isn’t just about caring for people’s physical illnesses — it also helps to protect the mental health of everyone involved. And leaders should be trained in how to communicate with the public about the risks of the virus and other threats. For people in power, being transparent and empathetic — “showing the public that you’re in it with them” — can help reduce the stress ordinary people feel during a time like this, Meredith said.

And while they aren’t a substitute for mental health treatment, there are things people can do to feel better during this time. Keeping to routines is important when possible, Javanbakht said. One of his patients, he noted, has begun taking walks with her husband when she would ordinarily be driving to or from work. “They call it commute time,” he said.

For those who have the time and energy, learning a new skill like gardening can also have a psychological impact. “For a lot of us, our sense of productivity and purpose is decreased,” Javanbakht said. “That’s a way of staying productive.”

It’s also important to maintain social relationships as much as possible using phone calls, FaceTime, and other remote communication. For that reason, Javanbakht prefers the term “physical distancing” rather than social distancing to describe how people should behave right now. “We can be physically distanced and socially very connected,” he said.

Living under a shelter-in-place order, Hollinger has been staying in touch with his friends by text and phone when he can. “They’ve been as supportive as possible,” he said.

A songwriter, he’s also been continuing to record music, releasing a single in April and trying to finish an album. “I have so much material over the past three months,” he said.

While he and others are finding ways to be creative amid the pandemic, millions of Americans remain in a state of extreme uncertainty, unsure when, if ever, they can resume their normal lives. That can take a psychological toll.

But a positive change since the days of SARS is that the mental health impact of the crisis is getting a lot of attention, Hawryluck said — not just from experts and policymakers but also from the media, with widespread discussions and tips for coping with stress. “At least this time,” she said, “people are talking about it.”

"['Jack Turban', 'Apr']",2020-04-15,"I want to donate plasma for an experimental Covid-19 treatment. Because of homophobia, I can’t.","Share All sharing options for: I want to donate plasma for an experimental Covid-19 treatment. Because of homophobia, I can’t.

A few weeks ago, I came down with a mild cough and a runny nose. I heard seasonal allergies were starting early and didn’t think much of it.

The next day, I was exhausted and had a splitting headache. As a doctor, I was required to get tested for Covid-19 before I could go back to work in the emergency room. The result was positive.

Fortunately, I’m already back to feeling like myself. I was one of the lucky people with relatively mild symptoms.

Now that I’m well, my blood could be used as an experimental cure for the new coronavirus. But because of homophobia, that won’t happen.

How plasma transfusions could treat coronavirus patients

New research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) describes an experimental treatment for those dying from Covid-19 called convalescent plasma transfusion. The procedure starts with collecting blood from people who have recovered from the virus. These donors have Covid-19-fighting antibodies that circulate in their blood, proteins made by the immune system that can bind to and neutralize the virus.

Once the blood donation is collected, researchers remove all the cells, and the result is plasma: a protein-rich solution that contains the anti-Covid-19 antibodies. This plasma is then transfused into the bloodstream of patients dying from the virus.

The thinking goes that the antibodies in the plasma will bind to the coronavirus, neutralize it, and help the patient recover. Similar strategies have been used for infectious diseases going as far back as the 1918 flu pandemic.

In the JAMA study, five critically ill patients were treated with the intervention, and by 12 days after the treatment, none had detectable virus in their bloodstream. A second study of 10 patients in the journal PNAS showed similar promise. The data we have so far on the treatment’s efficacy are preliminary, and we still need high-quality controlled trials. But it could save lives.

Researchers are so excited about this approach as a potential treatment that there are now at least 10 clinical trials ongoing around the world. In collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration, the Red Cross is actively recruiting plasma donors who have recovered from the disease. You can sign up here. That is, unless, you’re gay.

The current FDA policy is discriminatory and not based in science

The FDA says I can’t donate blood or plasma because I’m gay. In 1985, during the AIDS epidemic, the FDA placed a lifetime blood donation ban on all men who have ever had sex with men.

The policy was created to prevent blood banks from collecting blood that contains HIV. Since the AIDS crisis though, the US has instituted extensive procedures to test blood donations for infectious diseases, including HIV, to minimize this risk. It’s true that gay and bisexual men account for a large proportion of new HIV infections each year. It’s also true that tests to screen blood aren’t perfect. The risk of contracting HIV from a blood transfusion isn’t zero. But it is currently around 1 in 1.5 million.

The problem is that being gay isn’t the real risk factor here. Why should a monogamous gay man who has sex only with his husband be barred from donating blood when a heterosexual man who had condomless sex with 100 female partners in the past three months can? The latter is at dramatically greater risk of HIV infection.

In 2014, Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) led more than 75 members of Congress in calling for an end to the ban, joining extensive lobbying from LGBTQ rights organizations in putting pressure on the administration for a change. In 2015, the Obama FDA reduced the lifetime ban to a 12-month ban on gay sex before donating.

Earlier this month, the FDA shortened the ban to three months of abstinence from sex with other men, due in large part to the drastic drop in blood donations since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Just prior, Baldwin and other senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris, submitted another letter to the FDA asking them to end the discriminatory policy entirely.)

The new FDA guidance is a good but insufficient step forward. It’s still going to leave out the vast majority of men who have sex with men. And it still promotes the internalized homophobia many gay men experience from growing up in a homophobic society: You can only be good and pure if you don’t have gay sex. This is psychologically damaging, unscientific, and wrong.

The rules need to change and be based on scientific behavioral risk factors. “Instead of a blanket ban on recent sex between men, we need to explore an approach that asks all donors about their recent behaviors, including condom use, number of partners, and use of preexposure prophylaxis, which we know is highly effective in preventing HIV,” explains Dr. Julia Marcus, an assistant professor of population medicine at Harvard Medical School, where she studies the epidemiology of HIV. Such risk-based screening systems have been successfully implemented in Spain, Chile, Argentina, and South Africa. As written, the FDA rules aren’t supported by science. They simply discriminate against gay and bisexual men.

America desperately needs more blood donations, and lifting this ban could save lives

Plasma donations are critical. If the experimental treatment works, countless deaths from Covid-19 could be prevented. But in addition to plasma, the US also has a dire shortage of whole blood.

Due to social distancing, there have been 150,000 fewer blood donations since the pandemic began. More blood is leaving the blood banks than is coming in. This blood is desperately needed for trauma victims who are bleeding out, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and children with sickle cell disease, to name a few in-need groups.

Federal officials have been begging the public to donate blood. They should know that gay men like me are ready to roll up our sleeves and help.

America is in the midst of a public health crisis. Old homophobic policies are making it worse: leaving trauma victims without donor blood and withholding plasma donations that could potentially save people dying from the coronavirus. It’s time for the FDA to lift the ban and save lives. When they do, I’ll be the first in line.

"['Anna North', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-15,Exclusive: Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith have a plan to fix the pandemic child care crisis,"Child care workers in America are in an untenable position right now. Some are on the front lines of the coronavirus response, caring for children of essential workers while often lacking health insurance themselves. Others are unable to make ends meet as families keep their kids at home and day care centers shutter.

Meanwhile, parents are left wondering whether their children’s care providers will even be in business when the pandemic is over, making child care possibly harder to find and more expensive than before.

Now, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Tina Smith (D-MN) are releasing a proposal to fix the problem. The plan, posted on Medium on Wednesday and provided to Vox exclusively ahead of publication, would set aside $50 billion for America’s child care system in the next coronavirus relief package. The money would be used in three main ways: to provide hazard pay and other support to those still caring for the children of essential workers, to help other providers keep paying their staff while they are closed, and to shore up the child care system (including boosting wages) for the future.

“When the time comes,” Warren and Smith write, “we will not be able to rebuild our economy if this country’s child care system has collapsed beneath the economic burden of this pandemic.”

The proposal is far more ambitious than the $3.5 billion set aside for child care in the recent federal stimulus legislation. And thus its prospects in the Republican-controlled Senate are uncertain, to say the least. But it is in line with what child care experts say is necessary to make sure child care providers can keep paying their workers during this time and reopen when it is safe to do so — and to remedy some of the inequities that have left child care workers in this country underpaid, overworked, and unacknowledged.

“We have only two options as a country: we can either do what is needed to stabilize the child care system, or we can watch child care providers collapse, one by one in our communities, leaving families with fewer options and hamstringing our economic recovery,” the senators write. “We are prepared to fight in Congress to save this system from collapse and strengthen it for the challenges ahead.”

The senators’ child care plan has three main parts

The challenges facing child care providers right now are severe. Many have closed their doors during the pandemic, either by order of state officials or because so many parents have pulled out their children that they can no longer remain open. But many day cares rely entirely on parent fees for their operating budget — if children aren’t coming, and parents aren’t paying, they have no money to pay staff. In a March survey of more than 6,000 child care providers by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, 49 percent said they had lost income as a result of families being unable to pay, and that number has likely risen since then. The result has been layoffs of child care providers around the country, many of whom were already struggling to make ends meet on an average wage of just $10.82 an hour.

What’s more, child care facilities already operate on a low margin, and even a brief closure could drive many out of business. In the NAEYC survey, 30 percent of providers said they would have to shut down permanently if forced to close for two weeks or more.

Some child care providers have kept their doors open to care for the children of essential workers. However, they also face serious challenges. Miren Algorri, who operates a day care in Chula Vista, California, told Vox last month that while her facility remained open, she was worried she would have to close because she was running low on disinfectant and other cleaning supplies. Meanwhile, child care workers around the country are more likely than other workers to lack paid sick leave and health insurance, making those still caring for children during this time especially vulnerable if they get sick themselves.

To remedy these problems, child care groups have called for a $50 billion investment in the system. The proposal by Warren and Smith would direct that money to states, territories, and tribal nations through expansion of the existing Child Care Development Block Grant program, with an eye toward three main goals:

Helping those still caring for the children of essential workers

“These providers are faced with the double whammy of increased costs (due to longer operating hours and the need for more intensive and frequent cleaning), and less revenue due to significantly reduced enrollment,” the senators write. Their plan would give workers hazard pay and increased paid leave, as well as eliminating all child care fees for essential workers like doctors, nurses, and grocery store workers, allowing them to get care at no cost during the pandemic.

Supporting providers who are closed

“Closures necessary to prevent the spread of the virus have left tens of thousands of child care providers without revenue to pay their workers or their basic operating expenses,” the senators note. Their plan would make up for the lack of parent fees during this time to keep closed child care providers afloat, allowing them to keep staff on payroll. The plan also allocates funding to train child care workers on new health and safety protocols, and it provides mental health support. The recent federal stimulus package also provides money to pay closed providers and to help essential workers with child care fees, but child care experts say it is far less than is needed.

Investing in the system for the future

The senators say their plan also includes enough money for states to go beyond the current crisis and make investments for the future, such as increasing child care worker pay and bolstering infrastructure. Such investment would help begin the process of strengthening America’s child care system, something Warren and other 2020 Democratic candidates began calling for long before the pandemic began. They note that even in the best of times, care is unaffordable for many families, while the workers who provide it remain underpaid. Warren introduced legislation last year aiming to establish universal, affordable child care throughout the country. The proposal with Smith is less sweeping but would allow states to make some of the investments that Warren and others have said are necessary.

Overall, the plan proposed by Warren and Smith is ambitious, but it’s in line with what experts have said is necessary to keep child care providers afloat now so that they can return to work when the crisis abates. “Child care will not be there for us when we’re all ready to go back to work if we don’t include them specifically, in a targeted, effective way, in the relief packages,” Kim Kruckel, executive director of the Child Care Law Center, told Vox earlier this month.

And the senators argue that without help for child care providers, true economic recovery will be impossible. “When the economy can start to safely get back on track,” they write, “millions of parents will not be able to return to work or reopen their own small businesses if they cannot find safe, affordable, and reliable care for their children.”

"['Eli Cahan Matt Debutts', 'Eli Cahan', 'Matt Debutts', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,The other hospital workers on the front lines of the pandemic,"Share All sharing options for: The other hospital workers on the front lines of the pandemic

Most evenings on her drive to the hospital, Gisella Thomas receives calls from her six children. They call from Las Vegas, Bakersfield, and the cornfields of Nebraska. They ask what she’s seeing at work. They want to know if she’s going to be okay.

As a respiratory therapist at the Desert Regional Medical Center outside of Los Angeles, Thomas, 72, is responsible for assisting to intubate patients diagnosed with Covid-19. Intubating requires her to lean over and thread a tube down the patient’s throat to ensure oxygen flows to their lungs. Her face is inches from their mouth. If the patient coughs, infected droplets will splatter her protective face shield. Her job is among the most dangerous in the hospital.

After caring for up to 15 Covid-19 patients during her overnight shift, Thomas drives home just after sunrise and returns calls from her worried children. While she is old enough to retire, she says she cannot afford to. Three of her six children are unemployed. Two more rely upon her health insurance.

Thomas tells her children not to worry. She’s going to be okay, she says.

In private, though, Thomas is less confident. “I’ve got to believe it will be okay,” she said. “It has to be.”

As Covid-19 overwhelms several hospital systems around the world, public attention has affixed on doctors and advanced practice providers, like nurse practitioners and physician assistants — the hospital’s leaders on the ground whose medical plans shape the field of battle.

Less visible but no less important, however, is the army of support staff like Thomas, whose daily exposure to Covid-19 patients — from changing their clothes to inserting life-saving ventilator tubes — sometimes exceeds that of the doctors they assist.

We interviewed over a dozen hospital support workers, nurses, and academic medical professionals. (Eli Cahan, a co-author of this story, is a fourth-year medical student at New York University.) Many of these support staff earn lower wages, and some have unemployed family members or sick dependents. Others have young children at home with few options for child care because of family leave policies that have lagged behind widespread school closures. Some are older and have preexisting conditions that multiply their risk of severe Covid-19 illness — or dying from it. Lower in status at work than doctors, some feel unable to advocate for greater protections, fearful of provoking their superiors’ retribution.

Protecting these workers is also a larger safety issue. In previous epidemics, unprotected support staff have emerged as hidden “super-spreaders” as they traverse hospital floors serving lunch, cleaning linens, or taking X-rays. During the West African Ebola epidemic of 2014-’15, for example, support staff were up to 32 times more likely to become infected than the general population, according to the World Health Organization — and 48 percent more likely to become infected than doctors. And without these workers, the hospital’s delicate ecosystem would collapse.

Financially and medically exposed, support workers are at risk. And without proper protections, they are putting everyone else within their reach at risk, too.

The support staff behind the curtain of hospital medicine

In a typical hospital admission in the US, a patient enters the emergency room and is greeted by a registration clerk — sitting a foot or so away, behind a desk. Then a triage nurse arrives to ask about their symptoms. Within minutes, a blood-drawing specialist (a phlebotomist) stops by to collect a vial or two. If the patient is admitted, a telemetry nurse wires them up to pulse monitors on a stretcher.

Transport staff may wheel them into the radiology ward for X-rays, where a radiology technologist fashions a lead vest and positions them in the scanner where the pictures are taken. After the patient leaves the darkroom, an environmental technician sanitizes the room behind them while a facilities engineer tightens a creaky hinge. Back in the waiting bay, the patient may snack on pudding delivered by a dietary specialist. After this routine, a doctor appears.

Of course, Covid-19 has scrambled these procedures. To minimize exposures, hospitals have placed plexiglass at the registration desk and wrapped radiology equipment in plastic. Some have started performing intake interviews through video and now only draw blood when absolutely necessary. Others have made makeshift emergency wings separated from negative-pressure “bubbles” for Covid-19 patients.

Yet even after taking these precautions, many hospital tasks remain essential. Admitted patients require IV drips; someone must hang them. Patients will get blood clots if they don’t move; someone must help them walk. Someone must fetch broth and Jello to ensure they eat. Someone must bathe them. Someone must empty their bedpan. Someone must clean their soiled linens.

At Methodist Hospital in Sacramento, that “someone” is often Irene Gourdine.

After a Covid-19 patient leaves the hospital, Gourdine, 63, dons a protective suit and holsters her sanitizer. She sweeps the floors and scrubs the gurneys of the vacated room. If she misses a spot, a patient or doctor could get sick. If she is careless, she could inhale the virus through her nose or smear it on her eyes.

According to GlassDoor, a website where employees anonymously submit their salaries, a typical environmental technician’s salary is $10 an hour.

“I don’t know what people think of me,” said Gourdine, about her role. “Maybe that I’m a housekeeper, or a maid. But without me, this infection would be worse.”

In unspoken hospital hierarchies, staff like Gourdine rank lower in the pecking order than doctors and advanced practice providers. They tend to receive safety information or personal protective equipment (PPE) like gowns, gloves, or masks later than providers do. Few expect to receive prioritized testing or expedited care should they require treatment.

At Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, one resident, speaking under the condition of anonymity for fear of backlash from the hospital, shared that amid PPE shortages, support staff “are putting their lives at risk and by extension the lives of their people at home.” They are doing so, the resident continued, without the “security or the praise the doctors or nurses receive.”

Sara Singer, a professor of medicine and organizational behavior at Stanford University, has found that disparities in perceptions of safety are common in health care organizations. As a result of these hierarchies, “we’re seeing the potential for rationing play out,” Singer said, adding, “When facilities are faced with shortages, they have to make decisions that implicitly place a higher value on the skills of some over others.”

Moreover, many hospitals have focused on staffing and maintaining wards containing Covid-19 patients, diverting resources away from auxiliary departments like facilities or nursing. In the short-term, such redistribution provides desperately needed relief. In the long-term, however, it risks creating shortfalls elsewhere.

“The Covid floors, they have the signs, they get the PPE,” said Mary Temple, a post-anesthesia nurse at St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, California. “It’s the rest of the hospital I’m scared for. Like dietary. If they go down, we all go down.” (The hospital responded in a statement, “We provide all of our staff the equipment, training, and information they need to care for the patients they are assigned.”)

Temple’s concern is not unfounded. Emerging evidence suggests that when they do contract coronavirus, health care workers are much more likely to die. A study at a hospital in Wuhan, China, the initial epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak, revealed that 29 percent of those infected were health care workers. In Italy, a Lancet study found 20 percent of the health care workers developed infections. In the United States, nondoctor hospital workers like Gourdine make up a disproportionate share of the health care workforce relative to other countries.

The risks to support staff are exacerbated by inadequate PPE supplies

The morning after the night shift where he was instructed to re-wear contaminated gloves and gown, Frank Bagwell, 28, realized he would catch Covid-19.

Bagwell is a certified nurse’s assistant at Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, California. His responsibilities include spoon-feeding patients and transferring them to the toilet to defecate — along with bathing them and changing their undergarments if they don’t make it. Before Covid-19, reusing contaminated gear could get him fired. Now, he has been asked to reuse protective gear up to 20 times per overnight shift.

Like Thomas, the respiratory therapist, Bagwell’s responsibilities require him to interact closely with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patients. He can’t bathe or feed patients from six feet away.

Hi-Desert Medical Center did not directly address Bagwell’s complaints. “Like many other health systems, we have temporarily implemented strategies for PPE conservation,” Hi-Desert said in a statement. The hospital claims that these strategies are “consistent with Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidance.” However, the CDC’s guidelines explicitly note that extended use of disposable isolation gowns “can be considered only if there are no additional co-infectious diagnoses transmitted by contact (such as Clostridioides difficile) among patients.” Bagwell noted having a patient with C. difficile on his most recent shift.

Yet even as his PPE allowance is rationed, management is relying on him more than ever. With auxiliary staff furloughed to, in management’s words, “reduce unnecessary exposures,” Bagwell is being asked to unclog toilets and fix broken appliances. Interviewed over video chat, he extends his arms like a zombie, demonstrating how to do something he says is “physically impossible”: safely re-don a contaminated isolation gown.

Bianca Frogner, director of the University of Washington’s Center for Health Workforce Studies, acknowledges that support staff are “lower on the totem pole for getting PPE.” Although they are “a critical group” in the fight against Covid-19, she says, they “don’t get a lot of attention.”

In fact, a National Nurses Union (NNU) survey, focusing on the experiences of frontline registered nurses amid Covid-19, found that only a quarter of respondents — out of about 8,200 total — said their employer had sufficient PPE for a surge in patient numbers, as of March 16.

Advocating for better protection has even gotten some staff punished. Thomas, the respiratory therapist, said that her “hospital has clamped down on the social media” and that posting pictures could “jeopardize [her] position at the hospital.” Jhonna Porter, a charge nurse at West Hills Hospital near Los Angeles, posted a Facebook plea for mask donations directly to the nurses’ association — not to the hospital administration. A few days later, she was suspended for an alleged violation of medical privacy laws.

The timing was suspect, Porter thinks; she believes the goal is to intimidate her colleagues into silence. “The nurses on my unit are terrified to say anything for fear of losing their jobs,” said Porter.

West Hills Hospital disputed Porter’s interpretation. “The issue with Jhonna Porter arose when co-workers expressed concerns about her [sharing] specific information, including room numbers of possible COVID patients,” said West Hills Hospital in a statement. “Her later posts about masking and donations were not the issue.”

Lack of transparency amplifies the hazards support staff face

Transparent and continuous information is just as critical to infection prevention as proper PPE. Yet even under normal circumstances, hospitals face knotted medical privacy laws that strangle communication between departments. In the pandemonium of Covid-19, communication has been stifled in some hospitals and support staff can remain in the dark.

Paul Griffin, a facilities engineer at Trinity Hospital in New Port Richey, Florida, is responsible for fixing air conditioners and plugging leaky faucets. When dispatched to patient rooms, he isn’t told what threat the individuals residing there may pose to him. Instead, he says, he finds out “through the grapevine.” His co-workers clue him in on the rooms with “patients under investigation” — the term, he says, is used for anyone suspected of having Covid-19.

Griffin’s approach is mirrored by other support staff interviewed for this story. Gourdine, the environmental technician, “listens in at the nursing desk” for “chatter.” Aleida Morales, a phlebotomist in Southern California, relies on her colleagues for “tips” before making her rounds.

Many of these workers emphasized that procedures were changing daily. While workers differed in their assessment of their hospitals’ handling of internal communication, few felt that the hospital had communicated too much. In a questionnaire sent to 83 support staff across 28 hospitals conducted in collaboration with the Service International Employees Union (SEIU) in late March, nearly three in 10 felt that their hospitals’ safety standards were “minimal” during the Covid-19 pandemic — and over two-thirds felt these standards were “confusing.”

Support staff carry the dangers of coronavirus home with them

Kaila Brown, a patient care technician in New Port Richey, has struggled with a different sort of communication: explaining to her 7-year-old son the risks mom faces at work.

Her son, Jeffry, had noticed his mother wiping down the door handle after returning home. When she told him about the pandemic, he asked her if it was “like the flu.” She said it was. Sort of.

In previous pandemics, health care workers have often emerged as “super spreaders” as they shuttle between hospital wards and the wider community. The original “Typhoid Mary,” Mary Mallon — who infected over 25 patients, families, doctors, and staff at New York’s Sloane Hospital for Women during the 1915 typhus outbreak — was a cook in the medical center’s kitchens. During SARS in 2003, a single hospital laundry worker accounted for many of Taiwan’s earliest cases. During Ebola in 2014, nurses and midwives ignited the disease’s rapid spread throughout West Africa. If these workers aren’t protected, the greater community is a risk.

And their household members face great risks, too.

Hospital support staff seem intimately aware of this fact. Almost everyone interviewed adopted a similar routine upon returning home: They stripped near-naked at the door, threw all clothes into the laundry, then showered immediately. Workers with enclosed porches considered themselves lucky not to have to strip in front of their neighbors.

“The nurses on my unit are terrified to say anything for fear of losing their jobs”

Many families of support staff are physically vulnerable. Gabe Montoya, an emergency medical technician (EMT) at Kaiser Permanente Downey, checked into a hotel to protect his husband and elderly mother. Tonya Moore, a telemetry nurse at the University of Miami Hospital, returns home to an 18-year-old daughter on immunosuppressive drugs.

Support staff are not just in physical danger. They are in economic danger too. Like many American workers, thousands of nurses and other support staff have been furloughed, flexed, or fired as hospitals transform to treat Covid-19 patients.

Temple, the post-anesthesia nurse from Oxnard, lost six shifts after her unit was redesigned to accommodate a surge of Covid-19 patients that had not yet arrived. Temple borrowed money from her sister to pay the rent. If she is furloughed again next month, she’ll miss rent then, too.

While unions have sought to protect vulnerable workers by advocating for home safety protocols and resources to support child or elder care — Mary Kay Henry, international president of SEIU, described protecting workers as a “patriotic and moral requirement in this moment” — many hospital support staff face a daunting choice. If they go to work, they risk infecting themselves and their families. If they stay home, they protect their families but risk their livelihoods.

Even if they could stay home, many workers say they would feel guilty abandoning their patients. Bagwell, the nurse’s assistant, never considered taking leave. Though his girlfriend’s mother, who lives with him, has diabetes and asthma, he nevertheless shuffles in and out of patients’ rooms, handling bodily fluids and applying lotion to denuded backsides.

“My patients need help,” he said. Quitting his job would be a “cop-out.”

Last week, Bagwell self-quarantined in his garage after being exposed without PPE to a patient with Covid-19. A few days later, he tested negative for the coronavirus. The result offered scant reassurance. Three coworkers tested positive, he said.

Bagwell concluded he will inevitably become infected. He says he cannot risk exposing his girlfriend’s infirm mother to the virus. If she were to contract the virus, he confessed, “I’m not sure how we’ll deal.”

To make sure that doesn’t happen, Bagwell has a plan.

If he catches the virus, he’ll live out of his girlfriend’s mother’s car: a red Dodge SUV with interiors that he calls “pretty roomy.” His girlfriend, Donna, will bring food to the driveway. He’ll pull up to the curb and pick up the meal. Then he’ll find a spot by the roadside, park the car, and wait out the fevers.

“I’m making some life changes,” Bagwell said, “but ... I’m fine for now.”

"['Katherine Harmon Courage', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,Can you still do IVF during the coronavirus pandemic?,"Mika Mansukhani has spent three years undergoing intensive treatments in the hope of getting pregnant. Last summer, she and her husband finally got one viable, genetically sound embryo to transfer into her uterus. Doctors carefully froze the embryo at a New York City clinic, and March was going to be their month to transfer it.

Then the novel coronavirus arrived, sweeping through the city and putting her hope of becoming a mom — along with the hopes of thousands of others across the country — back on ice. “A lot of this is about waiting,” she says. “This is another blow.”

In the US, assisted reproductive technology was involved in the birth of more than 74,500 babies in 2018 alone (the year for which the most recent data is available). Now, though, infertility clinics all over the country are canceling many of these much-anticipated procedures, including embryo transfers, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

This is adding further stress for individuals and couples — who are often already strained by the process emotionally, physically, and financially — as they try to figure out when they might have another chance at becoming parents. And it’s adding a new layer of complexity for doctors as they work to determine who can delay treatment and who should continue.

Why some providers and individuals are suspending infertility treatments

On March 17, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) issued strongly worded recommendations that included not starting any new cycles of assisted ovulation, intrauterine inseminations (IUIs), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or “non-urgent” egg freezing. They also told clinicians to “strongly consider cancellation of all embryo transfers, whether fresh or frozen.”

The reasons for such rapid and firm measures are two-part. First, many non-urgent medical visits are being suspended for social distancing to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Second, it’s an effort to conserve the capacity of the medical system to treat people with more life-threatening illnesses.

“Many fertility centers are in hospitals or academic medical centers,” says Eric Widra, chief medical officer at Shady Grove Fertility, which has offices in seven states and normally performs thousands of procedures each year. “Providing fertility treatment in those settings can divert personnel and resources away from acutely ill people.” For their clinics, which are free-standing, they are continuing to offer treatment as they can if they can do it “in a fashion that limits the risk of spreading the disease and does not tax the health care system,” he says.

Additionally, the impacts of the new coronavirus on pregnant people and fetuses have not yet been thoroughly studied. Doctors are optimistic that the virus doesn’t pose an outsized risk during pregnancy, but there is still a lack of good data. Some potential parents also worry about just needing routine obstetric medical care from a pandemic-strained medical system.

Why some people are delaying their one good shot

In 2015, when Mansukhani and her husband were still dating, he was diagnosed with leukemia. His treatments, which included a bone marrow transplant, would render him infertile. So the couple decided to bank his sperm.

After they got married in 2017, they started working with an infertility clinic right away. After numerous egg retrievals (a process that involves weeks of medication, including intramuscular shots, and an invasive surgical procedure), in the summer of 2019, they had reached their final chance. One good embryo emerged from genetic screening.

“Since then, we’ve been trying to make sure that everything is in tip-top shape,” says Mansukhani, who is now 40. So she added acupuncture, fertility massages, and other measures to her already-intensive regimen of medications and lifestyle restrictions to make sure they had the best odds of the embryo implanting in her uterus and growing normally.

But the pandemic was gaining speed.

On March 13, just days before the planned transfer, she had a difficult conversation with her doctor. “Until then,” Mansukhani says, “I just wanted to plow ahead.” But after that, it seemed like “the world around us was sort of collapsing. I realized this is not a risk that I was willing to take.” So they postponed.

An estimated one in eight couples in the US struggles to get pregnant on their own

Doctors who treat infertility are keenly aware of their patients’ sense of urgency. “Infertility is a disease, and for some, it is time-sensitive,” Widra says. “We do not know how long this crisis will last.”

“We are working on a case-by-case basis,” says John Zhang, medical director and founder of New Hope Fertility in New York City. “Some patients have spent six months to have one opportunity to find one egg,” he says.

“It’s based on the patient,” he says. “If they haven’t started and are 35 years or younger, then we will delay. But for a patient 39 years or older who has been on treatment for six to nine months,” Zhang and his team would plan to continue for now.

Zhang, Widra, and other experts are working to stay on top of the latest developments in the rapidly evolving pandemic so they can recommend the best courses of action. “What is correct today may be wrong tomorrow and vice-versa,” Widra says. “We need to stay thoughtful, logical, and nimble as we navigate this.”

What it’s like to be continuing fertility treatment right now

Across the river in New Jersey, Marya Conetta, 30, was also facing the decision of whether to proceed with a frozen embryo transfer. She and her husband, after years of miscarriages, decided to go ahead with it on March 16. “Things kept escalating and getting worse every day,” she says. But she decided that, “for all of the people conceiving naturally, they’re kind of doing it anyway. This is our way of procreating.”

And it worked. The couple got good news about their pregnancy from early blood tests and an ultrasound. But they haven’t been able to go through all of it together. Since the transfer, her husband hasn’t been allowed to accompany her to the clinic for any of her appointments, due to restrictions on the number of visitors.

“Last week I had my first ultrasound appointment, and my husband was not allowed to be in the room,” she says. “We were not allowed to FaceTime either due to HIPPA laws. It was one of the hardest things to comprehend.”

Her next ultrasound will look for a heartbeat, and, she says, “the amount of anxiety I am feeling is indescribable. Being someone who has suffered multiple miscarriages, I know the feeling of not finding a heartbeat on the ultrasound. My greatest fear is that the baby does not have a heartbeat and I will be alone in the room without my husband.”

Conetta is also trying to shelve her worries about what things would look like if she winds up getting Covid-19 during her pregnancy. And she noted concern about continuing availability of her prescription medications, which are used for more than a month after the transfer to sustain pregnancy. “I’m feeling so many emotions — joy and excitement accompanied by fear and anxiety.”

Infertility already comes with emotional burdens

Jokes about a Covid-19 “baby boom,” anticipating additional pregnancies as couples spend more time at home together, are not helpful to people like Mansukhani. It’s just a painful reminder that they will not be one of those statistics, she says.

“If only it were that easy for some of us,” she says, adding that there is “a lot of this social pressure — and a lack of awareness about the actual trauma and toll of infertility.” And it’s a trauma that is not uncommon. An estimated one in eight couples in the US struggles to get pregnant on their own, not to mention individuals who want to start a family by themselves.

Even after the pandemic ends, this event might have longer-reaching impacts on assisted pregnancies. Widra anticipates a coronavirus dip for at least months after the pandemic is under control. He says he expects the economic recession will impact how many people decide to get treatment, which can cost upward of tens of thousands of dollars and is usually not covered by insurance.

But even for those who’ll continue on as soon as they can, many have already spent years waiting and hoping. And it is hard to call on yet more reserves of patience.

Mansukhani turns 41 this month. “It’s a number I’m still grappling with. I just had this idea in my head that I don’t want to turn 41 and have nothing to show for it. I don’t want to turn 41 and be in exactly the same position that I’ve been in for so long.”

Three days after she and her husband made the decision to not go through with the embryo transfer, she got a high fever, which can be particularly bad in early pregnancy. And that confirmed for her that they had made the right decision for them. “The best thing for us right now is just to focus on getting through day to day,” says Mansukhani.

"['Ian Millhiser', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,"The controversy over a Trump judge’s oddly partisan “religious liberty” opinion, explained","Judge Justin Walker, a very recent 38-year-old Trump appointee to a federal court in Kentucky, begins his opinion in On Fire Christian Center v. Fischer — a case brought by a Christian minister that claims the center was preventing from hosting an Easter service — as if he is the only thing protecting civilization from a cartoonishly evil tyrant.

“On Holy Thursday, an American mayor criminalized the communal celebration of Easter,” Walker begins. adding that “that sentence is one that this Court never expected to see outside the pages of a dystopian novel, or perhaps the pages of The Onion.”

Not long after Walker tossed this grenade into a brewing culture war, serious doubts emerged that the attack on Easter that the judge warned of actually ever existed. At the very least, it is fairly clear that Walker did not take some basic steps to ensure that the facts of this case are what Walker claimed that they are.

The case involves Louisville, Kentucky, Mayor Greg Fischer’s efforts to keep individuals from spreading the coronavirus. On Fire Christian Center wished to hold drive-in Easter services. It claims that parishioners would be required to remain in their cars, and that the pastor and other church employees would be appropriately socially distanced from the parked worshipers. Nevertheless, On Fire claimed that Fischer attempted to shut down these services.

After seeking relief in federal court, On Fire wound up before the unusually pugnacious conservative Judge Walker.

Walker has lived a charmed life for a man only 38 years of age. A former intern to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and law clerk to future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Walker has never tried a case and was confirmed to the federal trial bench despite the American Bar Association’s determination that he is “not qualified” for the job. Then, just months after Walker began his current job, President Trump nominated him for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguably the second-most-powerful court in the country.

Much of Walker’s opinion in On Fire is devoted to largely irrelevant history about pilgrims (“according to St. Paul, the first pilgrim was Abel”) and even more irrelevant reminders that, in the past, some prominent Democrats were members of the Ku Klux Klan (“just over three decades ago, another ex-Klansman was the Majority Leader of the United States Senate”). Walker does not turn to the facts of the On Fire case until page seven of his opinion.

There, only after he juxtaposes tales of slaves being beaten for “attending prayer meetings” alongside reminders that some long-dead Democrats were once Klansmen, the judge describes what he claims to be the dispute at the heart of this case: A Christian ministry wanted to hold a kind of drive-in Easter Sunday service, where parishioners would remain in their cars and social distancing guidelines will be respected, but Fischer, a Democrat, issued an order that bans such services.

If Walker is correct about what is actually at stake in this case, then he is most likely correct that Fischer may not forbid this ministry from holding Easter services under these very limited conditions. But it is far from clear that Walker accurately described the facts of this case. And even if he did, his opinion reads less like a judicial decision and more like a screed against Democrats published in an outlet like Breitbart.

This is indicative of a pattern that seems to be emerging among many of Trump’s appointees to the federal bench. Judges throughout the federal bench appear to be auditioning for higher jobs by broadcasting their conservative credentials, even when such auditioning requires them to write sloppy or poorly reasoned opinions.

Walker may have misrepresented the facts of this case.

In order to challenge a government action in federal court, a plaintiff must show that they were injured in some way by that government action, and that injury has to be more than speculative.

This is why, for example, lawyers who wished to challenge state bans on contraception in the mid-20th century had to find a person who’d actually been prosecuted under those laws to proceed with their challenge. It’s also why lawyers challenging Texas’s ban on “sodomy” had to find a client who had actually been prosecuted under that ban.

Which brings us back to the On Fire case. Walker claims that “Louisville has targeted religious worship by prohibiting drive-in church services,” but it’s not at all clear that such prohibition exists.

Mayor Fischer, for his part, says that he “attempted twice to contact the court” so that he could “present evidence that would have demonstrated there has been no legal enforcement mechanism communicated” regarding the drive-in services that were supposedly being banned.

If the city wasn’t enforcing any kind of ban against drive-in services, or if it would have only enforced a ban on services that violated social distancing guidelines, then the apocalyptic dispute Walker describes in his opinion simply doesn’t exist.

As Josh Blackman, a conservative law professor, wrote at the Volokh Conspiracy, if Walker had “held a 15 minute telephonic status conference,” meaning if Walker had simply called the lawyers on both sides of the case and allowed Fischer’s attorneys to explain what was going on, “any doubts about the proposed enforcement could have been resolved.” The judge likely would have determined that no court order was necessary because there was no real dispute between the two parties.

The particular court order On Fire Christian Center sought from Walker is known as a “temporary restraining order,” which is a form of very short-term relief that judges may hand down without speaking to the opposing party — at least in rare emergencies where time is of the essence.

But in this case, On Fire requested its temporary restraining order on Friday, and Walker did not rule on it until Saturday. Walker appears to have spent the intervening day writing a 20-page opinion and order and researching details about Plymouth Colony Gov. William Bradford’s views about pilgrims and St. Paul, rather than holding a brief phone call with Fischer’s lawyers.

Walker appears to be “auditioning” for a higher job

When I speak to sitting judges, I frequently hear them use a derisive word for the kind of opinion Walker handed down in On Fire: “auditioning.” To audition is to loudly and proudly advertise your conservative views in the hopes that you will be nominated to a higher court — or maybe even to the highest Court.

These judges may have learned to behave this way from a very high-profile role model: Justice Neil Gorsuch. As the 2016 election drew close, then-federal appellate Judge Gorsuch behaved like he was actively campaigning for a promotion.

At the time, the conservative Federalist Society, which plays a significant role in choosing Trump’s judicial nominees, was loudly signaling that it wanted judges and justices who would limit federal agencies’ power to create binding regulations. So Gorsuch started writing gratuitous opinions laying out the new limits he would impose on federal agencies. In one case, he even attached a separate concurring opinion to his own majority opinion.

As David Kaplan reports in The Most Dangerous Branch: Inside the Supreme Court’s Assault on the Constitution, these opinions were “a way for Gorsuch to call attention to himself, and it worked.” Kaplan writes that one of the future justice’s anti-regulatory opinions “proved decisive in clinching” the Trump White House’s decision to name Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

Auditioning seems to be an increasingly widespread practice among Trump judges with Supreme Court ambitions, and why wouldn’t it be? By selecting Gorsuch, Trump signaled that he is prone to reward judges who display their most conservative views like a peacock seeking a mate.

There are also some signs that the youngest group of these judges are combining a writing style more typically associated with conservative media with their ostentatious displays of conservatism. Gorsuch is often derisive of his colleagues’ views in his judicial opinions, but his writing style is fairly academic. Indeed, shortly after he joined the Supreme Court, his turgid prose inspired the mocking hashtag #GorsuchStyle.

To put it mildly, judges — not even Gorsuch — typically do not use their judicial opinions to suggest that the Democratic Party is actually the party of the KKK.

Yet Walker is not alone with his unusually harsh writing style. Late last month, Judge Brantley Starr, a 41-year-old Trump appointee to a federal court in Texas, wrote an opinion in an important guns case that is as larded down with unprofessional swipes at the Justice Department’s lawyers as it is with historical errors about the way 19th-century judges understood a particular legal term.

“The federal government forgot the Tenth Amendment and the structure of the Constitution itself,” Starr writes in his opinion. At another point, he blasts the government’s lawyers for failing to consider “one more place, where the collective will and knowledge of the people is expressed, that might indicate if the federal government has seized the police power from the states: the Constitution Wikipedia.”

This kind of behavior is unfortunate because judges are supposed to follow the law, not use their opinions as a vehicle to demonstrate how snarkily they can own the libs. If Walker or Starr wanted a job as a conservative commentator, they picked the wrong career.

But it is also unfortunate for another reason. Setting aside the question of whether Walker decided a made-up case in On Fire, he is correct on the merits that, at least in Kentucky, a city mayor may not ban drive-in church serves so long as those services adhere to social distancing guidelines.

Judges are often called on to resolve tense disputes between ordinary citizens and powerful officials, sometimes in cases where many lives are on the line. We trust judges with this power because we expect them to do so in a way that is both nonpartisan and primarily concerned with the law. And government officials obey those decisions because they also trust that the judge is motivated by something more than pure politics or personal advancement.

But if judges do not hold up their part of this bargain — if they behave in a transparently partisan way, or if they place their desire for career advancement before their obligations to the law — then they undercut the basic claim that we should obey judges at all. They also invite defiance from government officials.

As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, “the judiciary ... has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.”

By transforming a legal dispute into another battle in the culture war, Walker undermined his own authority. And he undermined the judiciary itself.

"['Anna North', 'Apr']",2020-04-10,Every aspect of the coronavirus pandemic exposes America’s devastating inequalities,"A month after being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the coronavirus has caused deaths in every state in America. It has taken the lives of celebrities like John Prine as well as local grocery store workers, transit operators, and other service employees. Tom Hanks has shared his thoughts on quarantine, and so have teens on TikTok. Millions of Americans of all walks of life have been ordered to stay at home, with no clear end in sight.

For this reason, some have described the coronavirus as an “equalizer.” “Everyone is subject to this virus,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in March. “I don’t care how smart, how rich, how powerful you think you are.”

But with every day that goes by, it becomes more clear that the virus isn’t an equalizer at all. Instead, it is exacerbating the inequalities in American society, taking a disproportionate toll on low-income Americans, people of color, and others who were already marginalized before the crisis hit.

It starts with who’s able to shelter in place — while many white-collar workers can work from home, a disproportionate share of the front-line workers still going to their jobs in many industries are women and people of color. And among those staying at home, inequality is still a huge issue, with some able to order delivery and others forced to visit overstretched food banks to meet their needs.

Meanwhile, early data suggest that black Americans are becoming ill and dying of coronavirus at much higher rates than white people, potentially as a result of existing health disparities that have their roots in structural racism and economic inequality. In Michigan, for example, black residents made up around 40 percent of coronavirus deaths as of April 9, even though only about 14 percent of the population is black, as Khushbu Shah reports at Vox. The prevalence among black Americans of heart disease and other “chronic conditions that are related to socioeconomic status” is “making the effect of the Covid crisis much worse,” Julia Lynch, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies health inequality, told Vox.

The pandemic has also brought with it an economic crisis — and that too has been far from an equalizer. Low-wage workers are especially vulnerable to layoffs during this time, as Vox’s Emily Stewart and Christina Animashaun report, with restaurant and retail workers especially at risk. That has left many workers who used to have jobs with the country’s major restaurant chains scrambling to keep a roof over their heads, Anthony Advincula, public affairs officer and national policy coordinator at Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which works on behalf of low-wage restaurant workers, told Vox. But “if you look for the executives of these restaurant chains, they’re probably in their vacation houses,” Advincula said.

Overall, the lesson of the pandemic so far is that while the virus itself can infect anyone, those hit hardest by the national and worldwide crisis around it are those who were already hurting — experiencing racism, housing instability, job insecurity, and other ills that disproportionately affect marginalized communities around the country. And many fear that unless policymakers do more to address the disparate impacts of the virus, the result will be a country that’s more unequal than it was before, even long after the pandemic is over.

The virus is hitting Americans of color the hardest

Despite repeated claims of being an “equalizer,” the coronavirus has always had a disproportionate impact on people who are already vulnerable — and often ignored. People over 65 and those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk of serious illness if infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That fact led some younger, healthy people to dismiss the virus initially as something that “only” harmed the old and sick.

Such an attitude “relegates people who have a chronic illness, people who have disabilities, and older adults” to a category of people who somehow don’t matter to society, sending the message that “we don’t have to care about this group as much,” Stacy Torres, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California San Francisco, told Vox in March.

With much of the nation under stay-at-home orders, there’s a greater understanding that people of all ages and without underlying conditions can become seriously ill from the virus. But that doesn’t mean it’s impacting all groups of people equally.

Instead, preliminary data from states and cities around the country suggests that black Americans are disproportionately likely to get sick and die from Covid-19. Michigan, where the majority-black city of Detroit is emerging as an epicenter, is just one example. In Chicago, black people made up 50 percent of cases and 68 percent of deaths as of April 7, Fabiola Cineas reports at Vox, even though just 30 percent of the city’s population is black. And according to preliminary data released by New York City on April 8, the coronavirus death rate for black New Yorkers is twice that of white residents.

There are a number of possible reasons for the disparity, but a big part of the reason black Americans are being affected so much more than white people in many places is “the underlying health problems that they are already experiencing,” Lynch said. Those include hypertension and diabetes, which can worsen the effects of the coronavirus — and which affect black Americans at disproportionately high rates.

And black Americans are more likely to have underlying conditions because of widespread racism and inequality, experts say. Many differences in health outcomes in America are “produced by access to things like adequate time to prepare healthy foods at home” and “adequate money to not be working three shifts and have really high stress levels,” Lynch said — access that white people are just more likely to have. As Cineas notes, 22 percent of black Americans lived in poverty in 2018, compared with 9 percent of white Americans.

Beyond poverty, a number of factors contribute to poor health among black people, from racism in medical settings to the physical health effects of discrimination. Redlining and other forms of housing discrimination have made black Americans more likely to live in neighborhoods affected by environmental contamination, which federal and state officials have been slow to respond to, in turn raising rates of chronic illness. In Flint, Michigan, for example, where much of the majority-black population has been affected by lead-contaminated drinking water, the pandemic is “a crisis on top of a crisis with a side of crisis,” Mayor Sheldon Neeley told Shah. Essentially, inequality in all facets of American society appears to have set up black Americans to bear the brunt of this crisis.

That inequality also extends to whether people can get (and pay for) adequate care during this time. Funding for public health clinics that serve low-income Americans has been drying up, Lynch said, leaving people who rely on such clinics without an obvious place to go for care, or even for information about whether they might be infected. And while the Trump administration now says it will pay for the treatment of Covid patients without insurance, some people have already incurred thousands of dollars in bills.

Danni Askini, for example, was being treated for lymphoma when she contracted the virus, according to Time. The bill for her Covid testing and treatment was $34,927.43. “I personally don’t know anybody who has that kind of money,” she told the magazine.

Not everyone can afford to shelter in place

Underlying conditions are likely only part of the reason Covid is hitting some Americans harder than others. In a time when people are being advised to stay home to minimize their risk of exposure, many literally can’t afford to do so.

To begin with, there are people whose jobs can’t be done remotely, like grocery store cashiers, delivery workers, and bus drivers. These workers have already seen a devastating impact from the virus, with 41 New York City transit workers having died and about 1,500 testing positive as of April 8, according to the New York Times. Grocery store chains are also beginning to report the deaths of workers, according to the Washington Post, with deaths of a Trader Joe’s employee in Scarsdale, New York, and two employees at a Walmart in Evergreen Park, Illinois, among the first to be publicly reported.

Workers in these front-line industries are also disproportionately female, according to a recent report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research. In many occupations within these industries, such as bus driving, warehouse work, and building cleaning, people of color are overrepresented. And about a quarter of all front-line workers live in low-income families.

While some health care workers, like doctors, can make a high income, inequality shows up within the health care workforce as well. Women and people of color are “much more likely to be in those really front-line staff positions where they’re less well-protected,” Lynch said, such as catering or janitorial services in hospitals. Especially given current shortages of protective equipment, these workers may be less likely than doctors to have the masks and gloves that can help keep them safer. In one Service Employees International Union poll of 250 hospital workers, mostly housekeepers and nurse’s assistants, 75 percent said they were told they did not need protective equipment or had to ask a nurse for it, according to Reuters.

Just as Americans’ jobs affect their risk during this time, so does their living situation. While people with means have been able to leave coronavirus hot spots like New York City for their vacation homes (sometimes sparking conflict with local residents), most Americans lack the mobility to leave areas that are hard-hit by the pandemic. Race and class also determine how much people can isolate themselves — housing discrimination and other inequalities contribute to the fact that black Americans are more likely to live in multigenerational homes and share resources like cars, as Cineas reports, making social distancing more difficult and increasing their exposure to the virus.

For incarcerated Americans and those who are homeless, the risks are especially acute. Cook County Jail in Chicago, for example, is the site of one of the nation’s largest coronavirus clusters, and at least 1,324 confirmed cases had been linked to prisons and jails across the country as of April 8, according to the New York Times. Meanwhile, as Vox’s Catherine Kim reports, homeless Americans are disproportionately at risk due to a lack of shelter space — especially as shelters try to adapt to distancing recommendations and deal with a lack of volunteers during the crisis.

Even for people who do have a home to go to, getting necessities can be difficult and risky in this moment — and like everything else, it’s more difficult and risky for those with less money. In a time when the White House has advised Americans not to go to the grocery store at all, some are able to order delivery from services like Instacart or Peapod. Demand for these services is skyrocketing — Instacart, for example, has seen a 300 percent increase in order volume in the past week, compared with the same period last year, Eater reports.

But “it’s the middle- and upper-class families who have the income to not only purchase items through these delivery systems but also the ability to pay for the delivery and the additional fees,” Daphne Hernandez, an associate professor at Cizik School of Nursing at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston who studies food insecurity, told Vox. Fees vary by service and order, with Instacart, for example, charging between $3.99 and $9.99 to deliver an order under $35, not including tip. Grocery items may be more expensive on some delivery platforms than in stores as well.

The services also require internet access, something not all low-income families have. So while wealthier people are able to order groceries on their phones (if they can get a time slot), lower-income families may have to go a store — and if they are still working, they may have to go at night, when shelves are more likely to be empty, Hernandez said. That means that lower-income people are both putting themselves at greater risk to get groceries right now and likely feeling the brunt of food shortages. Meanwhile, people who rely on food assistance programs are facing difficulty buying staples, because the brands designated as eligible for these programs have already been bought by other shoppers, BuzzFeed reports.

Related 11 questions about the coronavirus economic crisis you were too embarrassed to ask

Add to that the fact that many resources that usually help food-insecure people are struggling right now. Many children used to rely on schools for free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch, Hernandez points out — around the country, about 30 million kids qualify for these programs — and although schools set up food distribution centers when the crisis hit, some have shut down as a result of stay-at-home orders or a rise in infections. And food banks around the country are struggling to meet a spike in demand as a result of the pandemic.

Overall, “we’re going to see food insecurity rates spike,” which could lead to increases in health problems like obesity and diabetes among low-income Americans, Hernandez said. That, in turn, would set them up to be even more at risk in future public health crises.

The economic crisis will impact low-income Americans and people of color the most

In addition to its devastating impact on Americans’ health, the virus has ushered in an unprecedented economic crisis — the most serious since the Great Depression of the 1930s, according to the International Monetary Fund. In the US alone, more than 16 million new jobless claims were filed in just three weeks in March and early April.

The effects are being felt across the economy, from restaurants to tourism to media, but as with everything else about the crisis, the economic effects are being felt most keenly by those who are already most vulnerable. In March, experts estimated that those most vulnerable to layoffs during this time were those who could least afford to lose a paycheck, like low-wage workers in the restaurant and retail industries, as Vox’s Stewart and Animashaun report.

And across industries, those least able to weather a period of unemployment will be “lower-wage, lower-income households, which also tend to be disproportionately black and Latino households,” Valerie Wilson, the director of the Economic Policy Institute’s Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy, told Vox. Lower-income people are less likely to have savings to fall back on in such a time — and because of the racial wealth gap in America, black and Latino families are less likely than white Americans to have money put away. While the median wealth for white Americans was $171,000 in 2019, it was just $17,600 for black Americans, as Trymaine Lee reported at the New York Times Magazine.

The economic impact of the virus isn’t just about layoffs. It’s also about people who get sick, Wilson noted: “What will that mean in terms of their ability to work and support and care for their families?”

And since black Americans appear more likely to get seriously ill and die from the virus, their families are more likely to feel the economic impact of that as well.

The federal government has made moves to help, bolstering unemployment insurance, promising stimulus payments for many, and mandating paid sick leave for some. But those efforts leave out a lot of the most vulnerable Americans. For example, companies with more than 500 employees are exempt from providing paid sick leave to workers. While some large companies, like Walmart and Target, have said they will offer sick leave anyway, others, like Dine Brands, the parent company of the restaurant chains Applebee’s and IHOP, have not.

In an especially tone-deaf move, Applebee’s recently offered laid-off employees a 50 percent discount on Applebee’s orders, ROC United’s Advincula told Vox. (Applebee’s told Vox in a statement that 96 percent of its restaurants are franchise-owned, but that “for the 69 company-owned Applebee’s restaurants, we have a paid sick leave policy for our team members in accordance with applicable laws.”)

Moreover, applying for unemployment has become very difficult for many, with state unemployment offices overrun. And undocumented workers — who make up more than 10 percent of the restaurant workforce, according to Advincula — can’t get unemployment or stimulus payments.

Overall, there are a lot of gaps in the federal government’s efforts to stem the economic impact of the virus, Advincula said, and “a lot of restaurant workers have fallen into those cracks.”

The pandemic will dramatically worsen American inequality — unless the country takes action

Ultimately, the coronavirus pandemic stands to worsen the already enormous problem of inequality in America. But it doesn’t have to be that way. A variety of solutions would help protect the most vulnerable during this time, and set up the country for a more equal recovery.

“Obviously and most basically, people need to be able to go to the hospital and get care if they need it,” Lynch said. “We need to have universal access to health care that is affordable and of a high quality.”

Beyond that, robust paid sick leave in America would both allow people to care for themselves and family members when they are sick and help prevent the spread of disease. And the country needs to get to work on “generally reducing socioeconomic equality and deprivation,” because those are driving the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other underlying conditions among people of color and low-income Americans.

“People who are living lives close to the economic margins are always going to experience more of these kinds of conditions, and so reducing the poverty and inequality that generate ill health is going to make people more resilient in the face of these kinds of new illnesses,” Lynch said.

One way to promote health is to combat food insecurity. To do that right now, the US needs an expansion of SNAP and other food assistance programs for a minimum of six months, Hernandez said. After the Great Recession began in 2007, food insecurity rose about 30 percent the following year, she said. “We’re going to see something like that again unless we have programs in place that will sustain people after all of this is over.”

And, she added, food assistance programs need to be coupled with assistance paying for utilities and other necessities. “If people are having trouble accessing food,” she explained, “they’re also having problems paying for their bills.”

ROC United is asking the federal government to eliminate loopholes that allow large companies (as well as those with fewer than 50 employees) to deny paid sick leave. The group also calls for a loosening of unemployment restrictions, payments to unemployed workers who are undocumented, and a nationwide moratorium on evictions and utility shutoffs during this time. It’s also asking the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue standards for safe working conditions in light of Covid-19.

“Another pandemic is going to happen, so if we’re not ready again, this would hurt the economy and the country again,” Advincula said.

The Trump administration, however, has shown little appetite for many of these reforms. For example, the Department of Labor earlier this month issued guidelines giving small businesses broad latitude to deny their employees paid sick leave, according to the New York Times.

Still, members of Congress have been pressing the administration to pay attention to the ways the virus could be magnifying inequality. In March, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services calling on it to address racial disparities in the nation’s coronavirus response, including collecting and releasing nationwide data on cases broken out by race and ethnicity. “Without demographic data,” they wrote, “policy makers and researchers will have no way to identify and address ongoing disparities and health inequities that risk accelerating the impact of the novel coronavirus and the respiratory disease it causes.”

State officials are taking action too; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, for instance, created a task force on April 10 to address racial disparities in the virus’s impact on Michiganders. “We know that generations of racial disparities and inequality has a detrimental impact on the lives of people across the state,” Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who will chair the task force, said in a statement. “The coronavirus pandemic has shown this inequity to be particularly true.”

As the disease continues to spread and the economic impact increases, more and more people around the country will be in need of help — whether it’s caring for loved ones, healing from their own illnesses, or paying their bills. The impact of the pandemic, now and in the future, will likely remain concentrated among those who were already at a disadvantage before it hit — unless the country acts now to remedy the inequities that made them vulnerable in the first place.

Update: This story has been updated to include a statement from Applebee’s.

"['Khushbu Shah', 'Apr', 'Photographs Courtesy Of The']",2020-04-10,How racism and poverty made Detroit a new coronavirus hot spot,"An aunt, an uncle, and a cousin have tested positive for coronavirus, says Cassandra Spratling. A friend’s husband died. Her brother’s friend, like her aunt and uncle, is hospitalized.

“I’m almost afraid, I almost hate turning on my Facebook page, or even sometimes answering my phone,” says the 64-year-old Detroit native, once a journalist at the Detroit Free Press. As the number of deaths from Covid-19 rise in the city, she says, “it makes me a little nervous when I get a phone call because I’m always afraid that it’s going to be somebody I know.”

Spratling, in her northwest Detroit neighborhood, is like many African Americans nationwide, watching in fear as the coronavirus rapidly spreads in her hometown and in other black communities across the US.

As states have begun to release data on coronavirus deaths by race, what Spratling sees among her own community, and what she and others across the country have feared is confirmed: Black people have been particularly vulnerable to the ravages of the pandemic. Though African Americans make up nearly 14 percent of the population in Michigan, they account for around 40 percent of the state’s 1,076 coronavirus deaths as of April 9.

The disproportionate deaths from coronavirus among African Americans is a recurring pattern nationally. In Chicago, 67 percent of deaths have been black people. In Louisiana, that figure is 70 percent, with one-third of the state’s population being black. The death rates from Covid-19 by race are also disproportionate in places like Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and New York City. Even in states like Georgia, which has not released infection rates and deaths by race, the pattern re-appears: A large concentration of infections and deaths are in the southwestern part of the state, in a county that is nearly three-quarters black. A Pew Research Center report found in March that nearly half of black people see coronavirus as a major threat to their health, compared to a fifth of white people.

Detroit has one of the largest African American populations in the country — 79 percent of the city’s residents are black. And as residents like Spratling have noted, the city has seen a sudden, drastic rise of Covid-19 cases over the past week and a half. More than 80 percent of the state’s coronavirus cases are now in metro Detroit, making it Michigan’s epicenter. Even the country’s leading infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told ABC last week that “Detroit is starting to show some signs that they’re gonna take off.”

Residents, as well as health and elected officials, point to the city’s underlying inequalities as a reason.

The health disparities are stark for the community: Black people, from infants to older individuals, already die in disproportionately higher numbers than white people in Detroit, according to the city’s health department. The risk of diabetes is 77 percent higher for African Americans than white or Latinx communities in the city, a 2016 National Medical Association report found. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said higher blood pressure is more common among black people than white, Asian, or Latinx populations.

These underlying medical conditions — which also include asthma, heart disease, and other chronic lung disorders — are all more prevalent in black people than other groups because, as Fabiola Cineas pointed out for Vox, “hundreds of years of slavery, racism, and discrimination” — redlining, policing, restricting access to public health resources — “have compounded to deliver poor health and economic outcomes for black people.”

And now these same health conditions also appear to lead to more severe bouts of Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization. Further compounding these vulnerabilities are the fact that black people also face a lack of adequate access to health care and experience high rates of poverty.

As Michigan has seen its highest death tolls in recent days, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has acknowledged these disparities and announced the Michigan Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities on Thursday, chaired by Lieutenant Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, and consisting of local community leaders and health care professionals.

”This virus is holding up a mirror to our society and reminding us of deep inequities in our country,” Whitmer said in a statement. “From basic lack of access to health care, transportation, and protections in the workplace, these inequities hit people of color and vulnerable communities the hardest. This task force will help us start addressing these disparities right now as we work to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in Michigan.”

It’s a series of inequalities that point to why black people, not just in Detroit but across the nation, are experiencing higher numbers of Covid-19 cases — and why they are more likely to die from the virus.

Generations of poverty have made Detroit residents vulnerable to coronavirus

Experts have long argued that the city’s history of redlining and discriminatory policies locked Detroit’s growing black population into poverty over the past century. As black people moved north in the Great Migration in the early 20th century, the federal government began using race as criteria for who could get home loans, ensuring black people were left out of the housing market. But as desegregation movements ramped up in the ‘50s and ‘60s, the once-predominantly white city of Detroit saw a shift in demographics with suburbanization and “white flight.” However, that did not ease redlining practices (black people are still more likely than whites to be denied a loan today) and Detroit has remained one of the most segregated cities in the country.

Add to that the auto industry’s decline over the second half of the 20th century as companies decentralized operations out of Detroit, and the significant role it played in unemployment among black residents. Then, in 2013, the city declared bankruptcy. Before that happened, though, Detroit’s public health department was privatized, with its services turned over to a nonprofit in 2014 with a full-time staff of just five. Today, nearly 37 percent of the population lives in poverty, according to 2019 Census data.

Though the city’s economy had been slowly recovering post-bankruptcy, its legacy has left Detroit’s black residents especially vulnerable.

“Often pathogens emerge in a way that affects everybody equally, but very quickly, it’s those who are the disadvantaged, the ones without resources, that bear the brunt of the burden,” says Joseph Eisenberg, epidemiology chair and professor at the University of Michigan.

Evidence of that disadvantage is everywhere in Detroit, from its dozens of food banks to empty homes in the urban sprawl to the thousands of water shutoffs for those unable to pay their water bills.

“When we talk about the social determinants of disease, it’s really the fact that people living in poverty, without access to high-quality work opportunities without access to good transportation, who are forced to live in homes that are in disrepair and communities that expose folks to trauma, where the air is poisoned, the water may not be clean or too expensive so it’s unaffordable, where there’s not access to high quality foods, those all come together, they’re a syndrome,” Abdul El-Sayed, an epidemiologist who ran for Michigan governor in 2018, said of Detroit last year.

Measures that prevent the virus — hand-washing, social distancing — aren’t easy for residents without resources

As coronavirus cases popped up quickly in coastal cities like San Francisco and New York City, Detroit was preparing with plans in place by mid-March, the mayor’s office tells Vox. The city was “procuring testing kits and PPE supplies and putting plans in place for the large regional testing facility,” John Roach, communications director for Mayor Mike Duggan, says.

But there are measures also vital to containing the virus’s spread — like frequent hand-washing with soap — and thousands of homes in Detroit still had no water before the pandemic hit Michigan. Since 2014, over 140,000 homes in Detroit have had their water service disconnected as part of a debt-payment program, according to records obtained by local news outlet the Bridge. In 2019, more than 23,000 accounts had their water shut off, and 37 percent still hadn’t had service restored as of mid-January. With the virus spreading, the city promised to restore water to residents, but as of March 31, had only done so for 1,050 of the 10,000 people who called with a water service problem (8,000 of those callers did not qualify for the Coronavirus Water Restart Plan, according to a city report).

“Often pathogens emerge in a way that affects everybody equally, but very quickly, it’s those who are the disadvantaged, the ones without resources, that bear the brunt of the burden.”

“They put the onus on the customer to have to go in and take affirmative steps [to restore their water], so there are a lot of people who do not know, or secondly, don’t have the ability to go in and meet with someone,” says veteran civil rights lawyer Alice Jennings, who is working to restore water to the city’s most vulnerable. Her daughter, a Detroit teacher and a cancer survivor, is battling coronavirus.

Community groups, in the meantime, she said, are passing around five gallons of water to residents who don’t have water for drinking, cooking, or bathing, but Jennings doubts that residents are using the scarce water they have to wash their hands. “If the primary recommendation is ‘wash your hands, continuously, wash your hands,’ and there’s no water in the house to wash your hands,” the number of cases is certain to skyrocket, Jennings says.

Roach says shut-offs are not necessarily the equivalent to a family without water, clarifying that some of the homes where water has been shut off are vacant and others have transferred ownership. But when asked for the number of households without water, he referred Vox to the Detroit Water and Sanitation Department.

A spokesperson for the Sanitation Department told Vox it is untrue many of Detroit’s households remain without water. “Our service interruptions are temporary and we have programs to get households back on,” said Bryan Peckinpaugh, deputy director of public affairs for the department. “Of the 2,800 that remained off, most of those are vacant and the rest have been restored.”

But water is not the only issue for Detroit’s poor and black populations.

For the 34 percent of Detroit residents who do not have access to a car — many of whom are health care workers, grocery store workers, and other essential staff moving around the city by public transport — Duggan says the city will place 20,000 masks for public use on buses beginning this week. A drive-thru testing location has also been opened in Detroit.

Then there is the issue of hospital beds and staff. Two weeks ago, Whitmer warned that Detroit’s hospitals were nearing capacity. On Thursday, CNN reported that two coronavirus patients have died in Detroit emergency room hallways before help arrived, with hospital workers saying they are understaffed and short on supplies. (The Detroit Department of Health has not responded to multiple questions from Vox regarding hospital capacity or community engagement among black residents.)

Social distancing has also been slow to catch on among some residents, whether out of necessity — living in multigenerational homes, having to work, or focusing on finding dinner over keeping track of six feet of distance — or lack of understanding and regard for the implications. Jennings has seen boys playing basketball on city property. She has noticed people congregating on the street, rarely standing six feet apart from one another. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan acknowledged the issue in one of his regular briefings with Chief Public Health Officer of the Detroit Health Department, Denise Fair, on Monday, saying city police are breaking up groups and tracking those who are not following social distancing rules.

As elected officials and civil rights advocates have pointed out, to understand how to help coronavirus hot spots like Detroit is to understand — and address — the layers of inequities that its residents face.

Before Whitmer announced the state’s racial disparities task force on Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) called on the federal government to collect data about testing, infection, and death by race, listing out socioeconomic factors and inequalities that might lead to vulnerabilities among people of color. They have also urged for a release of that data, as have dozens of doctors with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, from US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, to examine any inequity around testing and treatment among communities of color.

Eisenberg, the epidemiologist, suggests that there has always been a tension between addressing social inequities and poverty and finding a vaccine. He uses the example of polio, pointing out that although the disease is not widespread in 2020, it is fundamentally easier for foundations and NGOs to direct billions of dollars toward polio eradication than deal with socio-economic issues. “Foundations want that success story tackling eradication, and this [social] issue is much more daunting,” he said.

Spratling is unsurprised African Americans are facing the most urgent battle against the coronavirus. She attributes the crisis in Detroit, in part, to an “inherent acceptance” of racism in America. “What’s happening now is a result of the continuing inequality in this country that dates back to slavery.”

But she believes her hometown will weather the growing crisis. “This is a city that has been knocked down repeatedly over the years, and somehow, the city always comes back,” she says. “I think it will be very, very tough times for people in this city but, you know, we’re going to make it.”

"['Catherine Kim', 'Apr']",2020-04-09,"As Puerto Rico prepares for the pandemic, residents fear the government hasn’t learned from Hurricane Maria","The people of Puerto Rico are no strangers to crisis, nor are they unfamiliar with a chaotic response from government. And so far, residents say, the local political controversies that have arisen in the face of the coronavirus pandemic are reminiscent of officials’ response to Hurricane Maria and other natural disasters that have devastated the island in recent years.

As of April 8, Puerto Rico had seen more than 600 cases and over 20 deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The low numbers can partially be contributed to the aggressive social distancing measures the government adopted after the island confirmed its first case on March 13 (a 68-year-old Italian woman who came to the island on a cruise). The island has been on lockdown since March 15, and people aren’t allowed to leave their homes from 7 pm to 5 am. It’s one of the strictest measures imposed in the US, and violators are punished by either a $5,000 fine or a six-month jail term. Enforcement has also been stern: hundreds of people have been cited so far, according to the Associated Press.

But experts also expect that a lack of testing has created the illusion of lower case numbers. The island has one of the lowest testing per capita rates in the US, with only Oklahoma below it, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Although it has a population of 3.2 million, Puerto Rico had only run 4,539 tests as of Tuesday.

In response, administrators paid two companies, Apex General Contractors and 313 LLC, $38 million for a million Covid-19 tests — only to find out that the tests were unusable because they weren’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration. They’re trying to pursue a refund of their 50 percent deposit of $19 million, but the outcome remains unclear. To further fuel criticism, there have also been allegations that the two companies were donors to the governor’s New Progressive Party (PNP), the Miami Herald reports.

“When I say I don’t trust the government, in essence, I don’t trust the people that right now are in the positions of power and are making these decisions,” said Oscar Ojeda, a researcher and activist in Puerto Rico.

That’s not the only scandal the government is fighting: The island is now on its third health secretary in three weeks, and officials are discovering stockpiles of unopened medical equipment that was originally meant for Hurricane Maria.

For Puerto Ricans, these scandals are disappointing but not surprising, given the government’s poor track record with disaster response, Ojeda said. However, the trauma of Hurricane Maria has helped Puerto Ricans organize faster against the virus. Even before the lockdown, he said, most of the population had social distanced voluntarily. Meanwhile, doctors are increasing telemedicine efforts, and nonprofits have been stepping up by gathering and delivering critical medical supplies to hospitals.

But Ojeda said he’s frustrated that the people of Puerto Rico are taking on responsibilities that belong to the government.

“How much is enough resiliency?” he asked. “How much are we going to have to take control over the government’s responsibility to ensure a robust quality of life for the citizens? How much responsibility should we actually have to take up upon our shoulders?”

The makeup of Puerto Rico’s population makes them particularly vulnerable to a Covid-19 outbreak

Puerto Rico is still recovering from not only Hurricane Maria in 2017 but also a series of earthquakes that shook the island in January. Hurricane Maria had a $43 billion impact on Puerto Rico’s economy — a devastating blow for an island that has already racked up more than $70 billion in debt. Then the earthquakes cost the island another $3.1 billion in property damages, as well as lost wages, business, and tourism from power outages. People had to rebuild their lives from the bottom up.

These disasters, coupled with inadequate aid from the federal government due to its territorial status, have left the island with a population that is older and poorer — both characteristics that make its population more vulnerable to a Covid-19 outbreak.

Immediately after Hurricane Maria, at least 123,000 people left the island, many of them working-age adults looking for jobs in the mainland US. That left many older people behind, and the population share of those beyond the age of 65 increased, going from 14 percent in 2008 to 21 percent in 2018, according to the Pew Research Center. This same group has been identified by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control as high risk for Covid-19.

Puerto Rico’s status as a US territory, coupled with a long history of ineffective economic policies, corruption, and natural disasters, has also made its population poor: 44.9 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, a number that is much higher than the national average of 13.1 percent. About half of the island’s population relies on Medicaid, and 640,000 people receive food stamps. That means that many can’t afford to seek the proper medical attention to monitor their health and detect the virus in a timely manner.

The high poverty level also affects people’s basic quality of life during quarantine, said Javier Nieves, an activist on the island. The shutdown is particularly painful for many of those who barely scrape by on a regular day and now no longer have an income.

“It’s pretty frustrating and really painful. A lot of people are going to die because of all this irresponsibility,” Nieves said. “People live check by check. People live on WIC and food stamps.”

The local government passed a $787 million aid plan in March that includes $500 to self-employed people and a 90-day moratorium on mortgage, car, and personal loan payments. It’s one of the most generous stimulus plans released at a local level, but Nieves said more radical measures — such as a halt on bills and rents — need to be implemented to provide a proper social safety net for Puerto Rico’s vulnerable populations (Puerto Ricans are also eligible for federal unemployment benefits through the recently passed CARES Act).

Then there’s the more deeply rooted issue of Puerto Rico’s poor health care system, which only got worse after Hurricane Maria. Thankfully, Dr. Wendy Matos, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico’s medical school, said, the hospitals haven’t been overwhelmed yet — but that could change when the island reaches its anticipated peak in early May. And if a major outbreak does happen, the island’s health care systems are poorly prepared: For a population of 3.2 million, there are only about 10,500 medical specialists and 500 ventilators, although experts predict they will need at least 3,000 if the virus spreads.

The issue becomes more dire in rural areas like Vieques, a neighboring island that still hasn’t been able to open its only hospital since Hurricane Maria, according to Mark Martin, who founded the community group Vieques Love. Its substitute health center, built to fill the void of the hospital, isn’t equipped to treat Covid-19 patients. “Vieques is treated as a rural area, so its health system is built to stabilize and then ship you over to the main island where they have real hospitals,” Martin said. The system failed during the hurricane, yet the government has done little to provide relief.

The government “isn’t learning from Maria,” he said. “They really should be boosting the local health center to a higher classification — if not a hospital, a higher level of treatment.”

Despite effective social distancing policies, multiple scandals have left people skeptical of the government

The island’s vulnerability to Covid-19 is precisely why Gov. Wanda Vázquez imposed some of the strictest social distancing measures in the US. Most businesses, other than grocery stores, banks, and pharmacies, are closed. And even these stores are inaccessible between the hours of 7 pm and 5 am, when Puerto Ricans aren’t allowed to leave their houses.

Despite other valid criticism of the government, it’s important to give credit where credit’s due, Matos said: The curfew and lockdown has helped the island dodge a more catastrophic scenario.

“I am a health educator and my background is in public health, but I never imagined that the virus was going to be so viral, so contagious,” she said. “I think that people are doing well and that the government took the right steps at the right moment, which was to lock down.”

Unfortunately, government scandals have raised skepticism among Puerto Ricans, Matos said. People are especially angered by the sheer mismanagement of testing kits: Because the government mistakenly ordered rapid testing kits that weren’t approved by the FDA, it is at risk of losing its $19 million deposit — an unfortunate loss for an island that is already in $74 billion of debt.

Matos added that the lack of tests has contributed to the low number of confirmed cases, as many patients go undetected. The criteria for administering a test is incredibly strict, so it is difficult to detect community spread of Covid-19.

Then there’s the frequent overturn in key cabinet positions, adding to the instability within the government. The island is on its third secretary of health in the past three weeks: The first, Rafael Rodríguez-Mercado, resigned after the island botched its response to early cases by mishandling samples, which led to delayed test results; the second, Dr. Concepción Quiñones de Longo, held her position for two weeks before resigning because she was unhappy with how the department was run. The latest, Dr. Lorenzo Gonzalez, has been doing a better job than his predecessors at handling the virus, Matos said, and is slowly starting to gain the trust of the people.

Then there is the discovery of stashes of personal protective gear donated during Hurricane Maria. On Saturday, the health secretary announced that officials found a warehouse with $4 million worth of supplies, although most of it had expired. He added that an additional cache of usable face masks, gowns, and gloves was found in Vieques’s abandoned hospital.

It’s ironic that the mismanagement of Hurricane Maria donations turned out to be a boon for health professionals fighting Covid-19 — but it doesn’t excuse the government’s past negligence, nor does it instill any confidence in the people that similar mistakes won’t be made again. For local activists who were long aware of this negligence, the narrative of the discovered supplies being a “blessing in disguise” is frustrating, Martin said.

“It’s insulting that the health center now says we discovered this thing that we didn’t know, that these people didn’t tell us about, and we’re going to use them for good,” he said. “So I think that they played a role that is not giving us our tranquility ... what [they’re bringing] is controversy.”

Puerto Ricans are used to taking on disasters as a community

The Puerto Rican government has a poor track record when it comes to supporting its people in a timely manner during a crisis. It took some families a year to get their electricity back after Hurricane Maria. People were still living in tents a month after January’s earthquakes. By now, Puerto Ricans are used to feeling abandoned, Martin said.

Puerto Ricans “waited for FEMA, they waited for the state government during Maria, and basically they never really came until people had gotten used to trauma and had figured out ways to cope or die,” he said. “There’s a lot of mistrust regarding what the government is going to do.”

The past three years have taught Puerto Ricans to be more self-sufficient so that they don’t have to rely on the government, Matos said. Although they may not have been prepared for an outbreak like the Covid-19 pandemic to hit, they already knew how to gather and distribute resources effectively, she said.

“We were ready in terms of ‘What do I need to do?’” she said. “Our survival mechanisms were up and running.”

The key lesson Martin learned after Hurricane Maria was to build a stockpile of supplies as quickly as possible. It’s why his organization has swiftly set up donations and purchased supplies for doctors and nurses in Vieques. His group bought a $26,000 ventilator, $10,000 worth of personal protective gear, a disinfecting machine, and some nontoxic disinfectant for common areas. They’ve also brought six doctors from the main island to Vieques to train local doctors, nurses, and EMTs on how to combat Covid-19.

Similar efforts to protect the community have been made by nonprofits on the main island. Accion Social de PR, a community organization that supports low-income families, is partnering with the Afya Foundation and San Juan Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino to deliver medical supplies to the homes of sick and older people. And groups like Makers Against COVID-19, the Rogue United, and mechanical engineering students from the University of Puerto Rico have teamed up to 3D-print face shields for health care workers.

At the same time, Martin said, disaster preparation should be spearheaded by the government, not the people. Although officials have helped build a biohazard unit for potential patients and provided some protective gear, aid shouldn’t stop there if they want to rebuild trust with the people of Puerto Rico.

“We would like to see a much more direct accountability of the people who should be supplying [these necessities], because sometimes, we’re so used to not getting them that we forget that this is like a mandate that somebody should be sending the stuff,” he said. “I think in the midst of chaos, accountability gets lost.”",vox,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/9/21213212/puerto-rico-coronavirus-covid-19
"['Anna North', 'Apr']",2020-04-09,The shift to online learning could worsen educational inequality,"Since New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a stay-at-home order on March 22, Tierra has been at home with her four children, ages six months, two years, five, and six. They live with her grandmother in a crowded apartment in Brownsville, a largely low-income neighborhood in Brooklyn.

The two older kids are in kindergarten and first grade, and like the 1.1 million other public-school students in New York City — and millions more around the country — their education has moved entirely online as schools close their doors to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

For Tierra’s family, that transition has been challenging. The family doesn’t have a computer, so the kids have been doing their schoolwork on iPhones, which makes it hard for Tierra, who asked that her last name not be used, to check their work. “It’s so small, I’ll probably miss something,” she told Vox.

It’s also hard for them to concentrate when they’re at home with the entire family. To help keep the baby quiet, Tierra sometimes puts on cartoons — but then the older kids watch those instead of paying attention to their schoolwork. At home “there’s so many distractions around,” Tierra says.

Her family’s experience is a reminder that while the transition to online education is an adjustment for everyone, it’s a lot more difficult for some families than for others. Like Tierra’s children, about 17 percent of students nationwide lack a computer at home, according to a 2019 analysis by the Associated Press. Eighteen percent lack broadband internet access. Low-income families and families of color are especially likely to be without these resources, according to the AP.

And the so-called “digital divide” is only the beginning. Many low-income students are now in the position of trying to do their schoolwork in small spaces shared with other family members — sometimes in just a single room. While cities have set up food distribution centers to help students in need, many are still missing out on the resources and sense of stability that school can provide. Meanwhile, students in poverty are having to deal with the trauma of living in a pandemic without many of the protections that more affluent families have, like the ability for parents to work from home or take sick leave.

“Children are watching family members die,” Natasha Capers, coordinator of New York City’s Coalition for Educational Justice, told Vox. “They’re watching their parents leave their home daily to go outside to work in what is described on television as a dangerous situation.”

Experts around the country fear that the coronavirus crisis will end up worsening America’s existing educational inequality, making it harder than ever for low-income students to learn, and putting them at an even greater disadvantage compared to their wealthier peers.

“My concern is that they will fall even further behind than they are already,” Raysa Rodriguez, associate executive director for policy and advocacy at the Citizens’ Committee for Children, said of students in temporary housing in New York. “Given what we know about the connection and relationship between education and future economic outcomes, I think that we’re really setting them up to fail in the long run if we don’t do even more to ensure that their educational needs are met.”

From lacking computers to physical space, low-income students are at a disadvantage in online learning

Schools have closed in all 50 states in response to the coronavirus crisis, with many states extending those closures through the end of the school year. In general, school districts are replacing in-person instruction with some form of distance learning, usually online.

What that looks like varies widely from state to state and district to district. In some cases, schools have switched at least part of the day to some form of video conference, Jennifer Darling-Aduana, a soon-to-be assistant professor at Georgia State University who studies equity in digital learning, told Vox. That has the advantage of providing face-to-face time with a teacher and limiting how much parents need to direct lessons, she said, but parents also have to be tech-savvy enough — and have the right equipment — to set up the conference. It’s also less workable with younger students who may have a harder time sitting still during a video call.

At the other extreme, Darling-Aduana said, are schools that are “just sending home a bunch of worksheets.” But that’s not particularly interactive, she said, and neither approach represents the “gold standard of digital learning, which is ideally providing students access to resources outside of their community.”

Reaching that gold standard requires significant advance preparation, Darling-Aduana added, a luxury districts around the country didn’t have in responding to the pandemic. The result is something of a hodgepodge, in which families are sometimes left with basic logistical challenges. Tierra, for example, recalls her kindergartner being told to cut out letters and paste them in boxes for one assignment. But, Tierra wondered, “How am I supposed to cut out some letters and paste them in the box if we’re doing it online?”

Meanwhile, online learning requires the ability for students to get online in the first place, which isn’t possible for many families. For starters, there’s the problem of internet access. “If you live in a more affluent community, you take it for granted,” Pedro Noguera, a professor of education at UCLA who studies inequality in schools, told Vox. However, “we have lots of urban and rural areas where internet access is not available.”

That availability varies widely from state to state. In Wyoming, for example, just under 3 percent of students lack internet, and about 14 percent lack broadband, according to Education Department statistics gathered in 2017 and analyzed by the AP. But in Washington, DC, 19 percent of students have no internet and 34 percent have no broadband.

Meanwhile, internet access isn’t much good if you don’t have a device a child can use for schoolwork. Around the country, many students lack access to a computer at home, from around 8 percent in Utah to 28 percent in DC.

And, especially for low-income families, “if you have more than one child, you may have a laptop at home, you may have a tablet, but you probably don’t have one for each child, especially if they’re young,” Capers said.

That can leave students of different ages trying to share a device, which is not an ideal solution when some districts are recommending multiple hours of online learning per day.

Then there’s the issue of physical space. While children of more affluent families may each have their own room in which to do homework or watch lectures, that’s not the case for many lower-income students. In New York City, for example, the current epicenter of the pandemic in the US, 1 in 10 public school students lives in a shelter or other temporary housing, Rodriguez said. Shelter housing in New York might mean a single room for a family with multiple school-aged kids, she said. “What does distance learning really look like in that scenario? How effective can that actually be in the long run?”

Meanwhile, distance learning requires a lot from parents, who have to make sure that kids have the tools they need, are using them correctly, and then help them stay on task and complete assignments in the absence of face-to-face contact with teachers and other school staff. “Online instruction often, especially initially, requires more, not less support,” than in-person learning, Darling-Aduana said.

Not every parent is able to provide that support. Some — often white-collar workers — are able to work remotely during this time and provide at least some supervision for their kids, Darling-Aduana noted. But others have to work outside the home, and although some cities, including New York, have set up centers to provide child care and instruction to children of essential workers, not all parents feel comfortable sending their children there.

There are also language barriers to consider. “There are lots of people in our system whose first language is not English,” Capers noted, meaning that parents and kids alike may have difficulty using online resources that are English-only. And there are socioeconomic differences in who feels comfortable reaching out to teachers for additional help, Darling-Aduana said.

Add to all that the fact that students in America right now are in an unprecedented crisis — one that is impacting low-income families and families of color the most severely, from high death rates in black communities to high levels of layoffs among low-wage workers. Those impacts touch all aspects of students’ lives, including school.

As much as it’s important to focus on academics, “I want to think about our children as people and what they’re going through, their families as people and what they’re going through,” Capers said.

Schools are trying to fill the resource gaps, but there are problems other than lacking technology

Experts say it’s critical to address the disparities in online learning, because they could magnify disparities that already exist.

Students in temporary housing in New York City, for example, “have much poorer outcomes than students who are permanently housed,” Rodriguez said, from attendance to performance on standardized tests. Even before the crisis, “we were significantly concerned about the educational outcomes of these students,” and now, “we are deeply troubled about their educational trajectory and the possibility of a significant amount of learning loss in the next coming weeks,” she noted.

Districts around the country are sending devices to students who don’t have them, in an effort to close at least that gap. New York City is sending iPads to students who don’t have computers, but as of Monday, Tierra’s family had yet to receive theirs. The city’s Department of Education says it is distributing the iPads on a rolling basis, starting the week of March 23 with students living in shelters, and continuing this week with high school students in public housing, students with disabilities, and multilingual learners.

Lack of internet access may be a more difficult problem, though districts are working to fix it. In Charleston, South Carolina, for example, 4,000 of the district’s 50,000 students have no internet, according to US News & World Report. The district has responded by strengthening wifi signals at schools so that families can access them from nearby, as well as deploying wifi-enabled buses to neighborhoods with a large percentage of low-income students. In Los Angeles, meanwhile, the district is partnering with Verizon to get students’ internet access, while Atlanta is distributing mobile hotspots in partnership with T-Mobile.

Meanwhile, the Citizens’ Committee for Children, a co-convener of New York’s Family Homelessness Coalition, is advocating that homeless students in New York City be allowed to go to regional enrichment centers for education, along with children of essential workers.

“Housing instability comes with a significant amount of trauma and schools play an important role in building resilience for children,” Rodriguez said. And given that there is a system set up to serve some students in the city, “students in temporary housing need to be prioritized.”

Schools and society as a whole also need to help to make sure students’ basic needs are being met as much as possible, Darling-Aduana said. And, according to Capers, they can’t act like this is business as usual.

“We have to rethink what we want to come out of this moment,” she said, and instead of focusing only on academics, start thinking about using distance learning to teach — and express — things like empathy and ethics. “How do we use this moment to really instill some core quality things into our system that have been missing?” Capers asked. “The biggest part of that is humanity.”",vox,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/9/21200159/coronavirus-school-digital-low-income-students-covid-new-york
"['Karie Fugett', 'Apr']",2020-04-09,I live in rural America cut off from the internet. The pandemic has made me more isolated than ever.,"Share All sharing options for: I live in rural America cut off from the internet. The pandemic has made me more isolated than ever.

I am writing this from my car, which is parked in a Taco Bell parking lot. I have been here for hours now, and I have lost count of the times employees have looked out the glass front doors to see if I’ve left yet. Every time I notice them, I sink a little lower in my seat. I don’t want to be here. I’m embarrassed. But I don’t have internet in my home, and without public wifi, I can’t work.

When I moved to Drain, Oregon, population 1,169, I did so because it was my dream to buy a small farm and land is cheaper here than in larger towns. What I didn’t realize was that in rural America, internet options are often limited.

Drain, for example, has satellite, hot spot, and fiber optics. I have tried a satellite and a hot spot, but the Douglas fir forest that surrounds my property blocks the signal. Ideally, I would have fiber optics, the most reliable source available to me, but my property is located behind railroad tracks. That means I have to pay a nonrefundable $1,500 application fee to the internet company to find out from the railroad company how much they will charge me to have a fiber optics line installed over the tracks. The internet company will not give me an estimate other than to say “it is very expensive,” and I cannot afford to gamble $1,500.

I am not alone — 33 million people in America live without internet, including 15 percent of folks living in rural areas. Though 34 percent of those without it simply don’t want it, 32 percent say they find the internet “too difficult to use,” and 19 percent are like me and cannot afford it.

JB Brown, 40, is a military veteran and business owner who lives in a small town of 537 people called Mineral, Virginia. He, too, lives without home internet access. He says he, his wife, and four children have gone without it for three years because the satellite service available is “very spotty” and “if you go over a certain amount of gigabytes they slow your internet down unless you purchase more at a crazy cost.” While he says the cost is not worth the unreliable service, the lack of internet has cost his business money. “I use an online platform for all of my bidding and contracts,” he told me. “I’m willing to bet I have lost well over $20,000 of business because bids have to get done in a timely manner.”

Before the coronavirus pandemic, as many others watched Netflix and worked from home and ordered groceries online, those without the internet learned to adapt to a slightly different lifestyle. For me, it was DVDs and chill, it was work-from-library freelance writer, it was cruising the produce aisle myself, old-school style. JB’s wife, Vanessa, completed the majority of her master’s degree from her phone. We make it work.

I’d gotten used to my internet routine pre-pandemic. On days I needed to work, I would drive 15 minutes to the Cottage Grove library because the internet there is more reliable than the one in Drain. If I was lucky, I’d get my favorite seat at the corner table next to the window and an outlet. Sometimes, if I had to work before or after business hours to make a deadline, I would spend nights and early mornings working in parking lots that had wifi. It was uncomfortable and the internet was never reliable, so I typically avoided writing projects with a quick turnaround. As with JB, it has cost me money.

But now that the libraries and businesses I used to rely on for internet have closed, the threads of connection I clung to before have been taken away. I cannot rent DVDs. I cannot go to the library to work. Even cruising grocery store aisles is a bad idea.

The irony is that because most places are closed, people without internet access need it to survive more than ever. If an employee isn’t considered essential and can’t work online, they lose their income. Students without internet cannot join their classmates on Zoom, setting them back in the school year. Workouts are going online. Therapy is going online. Online shopping has been deemed the safest option.

“When I am able to get online, I am amazed to read about the ways people are coming together virtually in the pandemic.”

But those in rural communities — as well as low-income communities — are being left behind. Kids who live in shelters may now have access to school-mandated devices, but they still lack internet access to do their schoolwork. Athena Lathos, 25, who is a library assistant at Albany Public Library in Albany, Oregon, says 20 percent of the people living in her county do not have internet and rely on their library for service. “The closing of our library has had an immediate impact on low-income and marginalized members of our community,” she told me. Since the pandemic began, “we have people parking along our perimeter for free wifi. Those who don’t have the ability to park like that, they have no recourse right now.”

The recent stimulus bill does include approximately $100 million “for grants to cover the construction, improvement, or acquisition of facilities and equipment needed to provide broadband service in eligible rural areas.” But it is unclear if this will help individuals like me and JB who cannot access preexisting services.

When I am able to get online, I am amazed to read about the ways people are coming together virtually in the pandemic. People are singing to each other, reading poetry, offering free yoga classes, and more. Humans are so resilient and creative and determined to connect. It’s inspiring. I just wish I could participate.

This pandemic has exposed, more than ever, just how necessary access to the internet is. My hope is that our government will do more in the future to remove barriers and ensure easy access to every American. Until then, I’ll be here in rural Oregon, lurking in fast-food parking lots in search of a few wifi bars and wondering, “What even is a Tiger King?”

"['Fabiola Cineas', 'Apr']",2020-04-07,Covid-19 is disproportionately taking black lives,"US Surgeon General Jerome Adams gave America a dire warning on Monday: The country was about to enter its worst week yet of the coronavirus pandemic, “our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment.” While Adams cautioned that the calamities wouldn’t be localized but would be “happening all over the country,” it’s becoming increasingly clear that based on new data, Covid-19 will have a starker impact on one group in particular: black people.

Over the past few days, several states and cities across the country have begun releasing Covid-19 outcomes by race. The preliminary numbers reveal that black people are facing higher risks when it comes to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

As of Tuesday, black people made up 33 percent of cases in Michigan and 40 percent of deaths, despite being just 14 percent of the state’s population. In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, where black people represent 26 percent of the population, they made up almost half of the county’s 945 cases and 81 percent of its 27 deaths, according to a ProPublica report. In Illinois, black people made up 42 percent of fatalities but make up only 14.6 percent of the state’s population. In Chicago, the data is even graver: Black people represented 68 percent of the city’s fatalities and more than 50 percent of cases but only make up 30 percent of the city’s total population.

In the South, the numbers are also grim. In Louisiana, black people accounted for more than 70 percent of deaths in a state population that is about 33 percent black. About 33 percent of the state’s 512 deaths as of Tuesday morning have occurred in Orleans Parish, where black people make up more than 60 percent of the population and where 29 percent of people live in poverty, according to 2018 census data. Louisiana’s first teen death — also one of the first teen deaths in the nation — was that of 17-year-old New Orleans resident Jaquan Anderson, an aspiring NFL player, according to local reports.

On Wednesday, New York, deemed the country’s epicenter of coronavirus cases, finally released preliminary data of Covid-19 deaths broken down by race. With 90 percent reporting in the state, 18 percent of deaths have been black people, despite being only 9 percent of the population; in New York City, with 65 percent reporting, 28 percent of deaths have been black people, while the city’s population is 22 percent black. Hispanics have made up the highest death rates in both the state and the city, 14 percent and 34 percent respectively, despite being 11 percent of the state population and 29 percent of the city’s.

Meanwhile, the federal government hasn’t released any stats on race.

Health professionals and elected officials, like Congress members Elizabeth Warren and Ayanna Pressley, have called on institutions like the country’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to track Covid-19 testing and outcomes by race. The national Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, bolstered by 400 doctors from across the country, also demanded on Monday that the federal administration and local governments address racial disparities in Covid-19 treatment and testing, starting with the release of comprehensive information that includes race and ethnicity.

Still, the emergence of just a smidgen of the Covid-19 data on race already tells a grim story that shouldn’t shock anyone who knows a little about the systemic oppression of black people in America. Hundreds of years of slavery, racism, and discrimination have compounded to deliver poor health and economic outcomes for black people — heart disease, diabetes, and poverty, for starters — that are only being magnified under the unforgiving lens of the coronavirus pandemic. And negligible efforts to redress black communities are being agitated like a bee’s nest prodded with a stick.

This has left some health care professionals and academics wondering if the coronavirus pandemic will ultimately become a black pandemic. Once wealthy and middle-class white people overcome the early throes of the virus, will America still care when it’s only ravaging black communities? Can racial demographic information in testing eventually become a tool to further marginalize the most vulnerable?

“Nowhere else would we say let’s skip a major variable or factor in analyzing a national or worldwide epidemic,” Brookings Institution fellow Andre M. Perry tells Vox. “The reticence to report racial data is a reflection of how black and brown people are marginalized.”

How health disparities make black Americans more vulnerable to coronavirus

Well before the novel coronavirus arrived at America’s shores, black people across the country, regardless of socioeconomic status, have lived with chronic illnesses — long-term health conditions like diabetes and hypertension — at high rates. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Minority Health, the death rate for black people is generally higher than that of whites for “heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and homicide.”

When combined with Covid-19 in the body, people already suffering from chronic illnesses or from comorbidity suffer the worst health outcomes. The underlying conditions increase a patient’s chance of hospitalization and even death. Some health professionals also stress that we pay attention to black people with less prevalent chronic conditions, like lupus and Crohn’s disease, or those with renal failure who can’t stay home because they must go outside for treatments like dialysis, as they may be more vulnerable to coronavirus, too.

In Detroit, where black people make up 80 percent of the city’s population, chronic illnesses have already created a lethal storm. Detroit represents 7 percent of Michigan’s population but 26 percent of the state’s infections and 25 percent of its deaths.

“It’s almost like structural racism has made black people sick”

“What we are seeing is that because of the way [Covid-19] attacks the body, in terms of what it does in the lungs and how it interacts with the part of the body that controls the blood system, people with hypertension are more susceptible to the illness itself,” Philip Levy, a professor of emergency medicine and assistant vice president at Wayne State University where he focuses on health disparities in Detroit, tells Vox.

When the virus first began to manifest in the city, Levy helped set up infrastructure to test health care workers and first responders. He has seen a lot of comorbidities in the firefighters and police officers he’s tested, and those who test positive for Covid-19 are especially vulnerable. “We have to get them out of the workforce,” he says.

Levy points out that it’s not just elderly people who are falling prey to comorbidity. “There’s a high degree of hypertension among younger individuals here, where they have elevated blood pressure on a higher basis,” he says. “Young people think they are invincible, but they might have hypertension at 30 and succumb to this infection.”

This is also backed up by data released in Louisiana on Monday. In the state, the leading underlying medical conditions in patients who tested positive for coronavirus are hypertension (66.4 percent), diabetes (43.52 percent), chronic kidney disease (25.1 percent), and obesity (24.7 percent).

“Louisiana is already being hit hard by [Covid-19] since there are a lot of comorbidities associated with negative outcomes for the virus,” Paula Seal, an associate professor at Louisiana State University School of Medicine’s infectious diseases division in New Orleans, tells Vox. On the clinical side, Seal works in the HIV outpatient clinic at the University Medical Center and does inpatient counsel for general infectious diseases patients. Seal has been present since her facility, one of New Orleans’ key safety net hospitals, began seeing Covid-19 patients in the second week of March.

The fact that New Orleans sees new HIV diagnoses often means that patients at the clinic already walk in with the hurdles of health inequity and racial disparity, Seal says. “HIV itself accelerates aging and presents a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, and we are now seeing increased weight gain,” she says. “Many of these things identify as risk factors for [Covid-19 too].”

Seal points out that a reason why racial disparities in health care are more pronounced in the South is the fact that a number of governors, including former Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, rejected Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. “It wasn’t until Jon Bel Edwards came in that Medicaid expansion was accepted. That helped a lot,” Seal says.

The 2016 expansion, which covers 10 percent of people in the state, has been proven to decrease annual mortality in Louisiana, cut uninsurance rates in half, and expand access to care. Louisiana is the only state in the Deep South to embrace the legislation. Still, Seal suggests that a lack of access to primary care for generations may have added to the Covid-19 risk factors the black community was already facing.

The reason for compounded health problems among black Americans: racism

“It’s almost like structural racism has made black people sick,” Uché Blackstock, an emergency medicine physician in Brooklyn and the founder and CEO of Advancing Health Equity, an organization that fights health care inequity, tells Vox.

Blackstock, who works in a gentrifying neighborhood in central Brooklyn, says she is used to seeing a mix of people at her clinic, but with Covid-19, it’s lately “been all black people” — essential workers who don’t have the luxury of leveraging wealth to escape to homes on Long Island, upstate New York, Connecticut, or Rhode Island. Environmental racism, including practices like toxic dumping, has worked in tandem with other kinds of oppression (racial restrictive housing covenants and anti-busing measures, to name two) to produce stress and contribute to high rates of chronic illness.

According to Blackstock, the pandemic is exposing a deep-rooted system of the haves and have-nots. It’s also displaying how black and brown people have a more tenuous existence in New York City since they lack job security, sick leave, and health insurance. They must ride public transportation to get to work on the front lines, many of them driving the buses themselves or cleaning the hospitals where they are directly at risk.

And those are the ones who still have jobs: The latest US unemployment figures show that black people were disproportionately impacted by job losses in March. The unemployment rate was highest for blacks at 6.7 percent and lowest for whites at 4 percent. Nationally, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent as nearly 10 million Americans filed for unemployment compensation at the end of the month.

To fight the spread of the coronavirus, public health experts say that social distancing is one of the most effective measures people can take. But being able to socially or physically distance is a privilege. Black families often live in multigenerational homes, with the very young and the very old together under one roof. In 2016, 26 percent of black people lived in multigenerational homes, while 16 percent of whites did, according to Pew Research. Perry says residential segregation is making black people sick, and it started with housing discrimination and redlining, the unethical practice of refusing or limiting loans and services to people based on race, income, or neighborhood.

“Redlining determined that certain black areas weren’t worthy of housing, ensuring that black people didn’t have the ability to pass down wealth to their children. It determined where black people could live, what kind of jobs they had, and the colleges and elementary schools they would attend,” Perry says.

And over time, low-income black people became concentrated in the same areas, with vulnerabilities stacking atop one another. Black people’s movement has been restricted, making them more vulnerable to economic shocks. “When you’re poor, you use other people to make ends meet,” Perry says. “You share cars, you share energy, you live together. You’re not afforded the luxury of not being connected.”

This dependency feeds the cycle of poverty. Without any intervention, families remain trapped, vulnerable to factors like low food access or low-quality education in segregated neighborhoods that beget their susceptibility to infectious disease. In 2018, the poverty rate for black Americans was 22 percent, according to a 2018 analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. By comparison, it was 9 percent for white Americans.

Abandoned populations are the most vulnerable in the pandemic

Black people are also often overrepresented in abandoned populations like the homeless and incarcerated. Because these groups are an afterthought in American society, they’re especially vulnerable. Covid-19 will easily compromise them, public health officials warn, which is why advocates are calling for specific protection measures now.

In Detroit, where the homeless population is majority black, Levy is working with the city to test members of the homeless for Covid-19, an effort that could save thousands of lives.

“There are 2,100 chronically homeless people in Detroit, and we must make sure they don’t get duly afflicted with coronavirus as a virtue of residing in shelters together,” Levy says. The city is reopening temporary shelters and setting up 500 more beds across the facilities that will allow for social distancing.

Black people are also disproportionately represented in the country’s prison system; police targeting leads black people to be incarcerated at more than five times the rate of whites. Add the conditions of confinement — lack of access to basic necessities like clean water, soap, and ventilation — to already existing health conditions, and it’s no surprise that incarcerated people are more susceptible to sickness. In New York City’s Department of Corrections facilities, 286 inmates have tested positive for Covid-19, and on Sunday, New York City’s first inmate died at Rikers Island prison, according to BuzzFeed News. He was awaiting a hearing on a parole violation.

According to Brendan Saloner, a health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins, the result of a widespread outbreak in jails and prisons has catastrophic consequences. “The nature of outbreaks in prison is that once they set off, it’s hard to contain,” he tells Vox. “The pandemic is only magnifying structural inequality, and we won’t ever understand the true magnitude of what’s happening if we don’t include incarcerated populations.”

Some states, like California and even New York, have begun releasing people incarcerated for nonviolent crimes to reduce spread in the pandemic. However, advocates say more could be done, such as releasing those who are more vulnerable to the virus, including people who committed violent crimes but are no longer a threat because they are sick and old. Ultimately, advocates say, bold reforms at both the state and federal levels need to be taken, and taken quickly, if correctional facilities want to slow the escalating number of cases not only among the incarcerated but among those who work in prisons and jails, too.

What comes next will probably further disenfranchise the black community

With a lack of data comes a solid lack of certainty. Many health and civic leaders agree that a disaggregation of race and other demographic information would help health care professionals better treat patients as the country ventures through what is said to be its worst week yet in the pandemic.

“We are in unprecedented times right now so we need the data released immediately,” says Blackstock. “We know it will confirm what we are predicting. We need the information to determine exactly how to respond to the demands of surges of sick people.”

There’s worry that we will get the details when it’s far too late. Or worse, even when we get the information we need, it might serve as a ticket for the rest of the country to move on.

In Memphis, Tennessee, community activist and pastor Earle Fisher is certain that the city will be ground zero for understanding how poverty leads to outsized health disparity, particularly in the face of a pandemic. But Memphis and Shelby County leadership have not displayed an interest in releasing detailed information on Covid-19 testing or in ramping up testing for residents at large, according to Fisher. “We’re leaving out a vulnerable community and subjecting them to even more deaths,” he says.

Past pandemics like the 1918 influenza outbreak and subsequent H1N1 seasons show that black people have a higher risk of dying when they contract widespread disease. In 1918, for example, even though black people had lower morbidity and mortality overall, they still had higher fatality rates. And though black people had lower rates of influenza, whites still advanced racist theories about black people being infectious disease threats. Then there is HIV, which has also disproportionately affected black Americans in recent years, a statistic that is rarely talked about.

Fisher recited an age-old saying in the black community: “If white America has a cold, black America has the flu. If white America has Covid-19, what do we have?” The question stumps other leaders, too.

Blackstock and Perry see some validity in asking, if white America recovers and moves on, will the country care about a pandemic that continues to terrorize black communities? Will the president or the CDC continue to hold press conferences once white people are mostly in the clear?

“Black people have been suffering from a number of epidemics and no one batted an eye,” Perry says. “The status of the country has always been measured by the status of white people.”

While Blackstock said it’s still too early to make any definitive predictions, she says “those who do care have to be as vocal as possible — we have families and generations of people who call these communities home.”

The burden is once again on black people to demand information and related actions that will save their lives.

"['James Breakwell', 'Apr']",2020-03-31,The case for raising a mediocre kid,"My kids probably aren’t going to cure cancer. They probably aren’t going to be professional athletes or billionaire CEOs or world-famous singer-songwriters. They probably aren’t going to be the first to land on Mars or the first to climb Mount Everest while doing a handstand or even the first to read the terms and conditions all the way through. Sure, they could do any (or all) of those extraordinary things, but chances are they won’t. Instead, they’ll most likely grow up to be ordinary adults with ordinary lives. Like me. And like you.

It sounds like a horrible thing to say. How dare I shrug as my children drift toward mediocrity? I should push them harder and further and faster at the earliest possible age to reach their “full potential.” Lucky for my kids, that’s not my style. Of all the things my kids probably aren’t going to do, there’s only one I’m certain of: They aren’t going to give up their childhoods to chase “success.”

At some point, the early years of many American children shifted from a time to grow and learn to a time to get on the career fast track. The road to becoming a partner at an elite East Coast law firm doesn’t start when a high school junior first thinks about colleges. It begins when their parents enroll them in violin lessons at age 5 so they’ll seem well-rounded on their Ivy League applications. The pressure is real and well-documented, and it begins earlier and earlier. Tiny designer briefcases as baby shower gifts can’t be too far away.

It’s never been more apparent than now — in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, when many parents are doing all their normal duties while also working from home and guiding their kids through online classes that work about a third of the time — that we need to take another look at our standards for success. It’s hard to parent, teach, and work simultaneously, even though the myth of the super-mom and -dad has taught us to expect ourselves to be all things to all people at all times. If you thought kids would take it easy on parents due to something as minor as a worldwide quarantine, you’ve never met a real-life child.

Parents probably assume everybody else is still pushing their kids toward pre-pandemic standards for success, and they feel like they should be, too. The popular advice for how to do it all has no connection to reality: Set a schedule. Maintain normality. Limit screen time and get your kids hooked on books. They might as well recommend that you permanently give up sleep and grow fairy wings. I’ve never been a fan of limiting screen time, but now, I don’t even pretend to feel guilty when my kids finish their schoolwork and move straight to YouTube for the rest of the day. Whatever keeps them from killing each other is fine in my book. I don’t want my kids to be perfect, just alive. I was parenting apocalypse-style before it was cool.

I understand the culture of overachievement that got us here, even if I don’t agree with it. Growing up, my parents never put any pressure on me, but I fell in with a group of academic overachievers, and I hated to lose. As far as peer pressure goes, I could have done worse, but not by much. I was constantly stressed out as I pushed myself to succeed at everything, at least academically. I was valedictorian of my high school class, and I was miserable. I was valedictorian in college, too. (Don’t be impressed. I majored in English.)

But coming out ahead in high school and college didn’t make any difference in my life, and if I didn’t bring it up as an example of what not to do, I wouldn’t even remember that it happened. And that was just me putting pressure on myself to meet the ways in which society defines success. I can’t imagine what would have happened if that pressure came from my parents. I never would have had the free time to discover and pursue my real passions, like comedy writing or taking long naps. I would have been too busy going to therapy.

Today I have four young kids. I don’t want them to feel the pressure I did, from me or from themselves. I want to give them space to become their own people without pushing them toward a career path while they still have their baby teeth. That’s a weird thought in today’s world. Nobody thinks of children as having agency over their own lives. To many people, children are just a reflection of their parents’ decisions. Yet anyone who has actually spent time around kids knows that they have distinct personalities, with their own goals and preferences, pretty much from day one.

My oldest, age 9, still doesn’t play any sports (by her own choice), which is enough to get me locked up for neglect in some parts of the country. But she recently joined a robotics club she thought sounded fun, and she likes it so far. Maybe she’ll stick with it and turn it into a lifelong pursuit. Maybe she’ll drop it next year to focus on choir, or join a running club, or stand around our yard and poke things with a stick. I’m letting her explore her own interests because that’s what’s best for her. The fact that it lets me be lazy and not fly around the country for sports competitions is just a bonus.

Parents today feel as though they’re letting their kids down if they don’t give them every possible advantage, no matter the cost. You might worry that if your kid doesn’t get into the best preschool, they won’t qualify for advanced classes in elementary school and junior high and high school. Then they won’t get into their (or, more likely, your) dream college, so they’ll never land that high-paying job you always wanted. You know, for them. That’s why young couples jump on waiting lists for “top” preschools as soon as they find out they’re pregnant. It’s never too early to start raising those math and science scores.

It’s not just that parents are expected to push their kids toward success. It’s that they’re expected to push their kids toward one very specific kind of it. They feel pressured to move to expensive neighborhoods so their kids can attend “good” schools to get into “good” colleges so they can get “good” jobs. But in almost every case, “good” is just a euphemism for “well-funded” or “high-paying.” Parents who are seduced by the system expect a very measurable payout when their kids become high-powered doctors or lawyers or corporate executives, and they’re willing to pay top dollar to get them there.

It’s not a fair standard. Low-income people can’t afford to move a few miles down the road to a house that costs three times as much because of the school district. But those who can afford it aren’t doing themselves (or their kids) any favors, either. Kids internalize that pressure. If a family uproots itself solely so a child can have better opportunities at school, that kid better perform at the highest level — or else. Nobody triples their mortgage payments so their child can get Bs and Cs.

But isn’t a focus on excellence a good thing? Not for kids. The world may be physically safer than it’s ever been (current pandemic notwithstanding), but kids today are more depressed and anxious than ever, and the extreme pressure to succeed can be a contributing factor. A 2014 review of 16 scientific studies found that burnout, which had previously been documented among professionals and university students, is now clearly present in high school populations, increasing the risk for anxiety and depression. Kids feel pressured by their parents, society, and themselves to never slip up. Perfectionism among students has been rising since the 1980s, and it doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. The result is a generation of kids on target to be equal parts wealthy and unhappy. There’s nothing less perfect than that.

I get why parents feel pressured. Income inequality is the highest it’s been in 50 years, and as a new recession looms, it can seem like winning in today’s competitive job market is the only way to feel secure. A college degree can mean a better life, so it makes sense that parents, especially those who are working- or middle-class, push their children so hard to get one. (For families that are already winning in the current economy, it seems like less of a necessity and more like running up the score.) But regardless of a household’s income level, the negative effects of academic pressure are the same. Pushing kids too hard too early can hold them back in ways that never show up on a standardized test score. More and more, “excellent” and “damaged” go hand-in-hand.

Am I really saying you shouldn’t do everything in your power to make sure your child makes as much money as possible one day? Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying. Take a deep breath. I have only three goals for my own kids, none of which have anything to do with becoming the richest people in the world. I’ll consider my kids to be successful adults someday if: 1) they can support themselves, 2) they’re not serial killers, and 3) they don’t blame me for all of their problems. There are so many other perfectly good scapegoats in the world. I just want them to leave me out of it.

Ultimately, you can’t control your kid’s future, whether you take a laid-back approach to parenting or read SAT prep questions to them in utero. What you can do is give your child the mental and emotional tools to not define themselves by their test scores or salary. The greatest thing you can teach your kid is how to find meaning and fulfillment on their own. Kids who grow up understanding that are the ones who really come out ahead in life, regardless of their class rank or tax bracket.

Recently, I took my 9-year-old to the park and taught her to play wiffle ball. We made it through all nine innings and had a great time together, even if it was a little cold and windy to be out. Nothing we did that day will lead down a road that will impress a college recruiter. Not everything has to be an organized sport or competition with the possibility of a scholarship dangling at the end. My dream for my oldest daughter isn’t for her to attend a top school that lands her a prestigious 80-hour-a-week job and puts her in the top 1 percent. It’s for her to one day have the free time to play wiffle ball with her own kids, if she decides to have them. There’s nothing mediocre about a life like that.

I don’t actually think I’m raising mediocre children. In fact, my kids might even be above average, which is what every parent thinks about their offspring. But I’ll never burden them with unrealistic expectations to become the smartest, richest, most famous, or whatever else is considered #goals on Instagram this week. I want my kids to be happy and healthy, with the freedom to pursue their passions.

That might seem ordinary to some, but to me, it’s the most extraordinary kind of life.

"['Rainesford Stauffer', 'Apr']",2020-04-08,Millennials were just starting to feel economically stable. Now we’re being hit with another recession.,"Muriel Vega graduated college in 2009 with a journalism degree and a job that barely paid the bills. The stress of attempting to support herself while trying to pay down credit card debt was “beyond words,” she explained.

Today, Vega has a savings account and a job in the tech industry that she feels is safe — at least for now. But she’s jaded. She knows that as the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic worsens, no one will bail her out but herself, which makes her feel guilty if she turns down extra freelance work. “As we’re trying to hack the system and figure it out, we just got hit again,” Vegas said. “It makes you just want to lay down and just stay there.”

Vega’s exasperation carries through a generation that feels they’ve seen this once before, at least. As I scroll through headlines of dire economic warnings between frantically checking my bank account and trying to plan for the unplannable, I can’t stop thinking about how my generation is facing the second major financial crisis of our lifetimes.

Last month, a record-breaking 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment, and the numbers will likely get worse. According to rough estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, job losses could hit 47 million — an unemployment rate of 32.1 percent — during the pandemic. While service industries, including hospitality and restaurants, are projected to take the biggest hit, white-collar jobs in tech, legal services, and marketing are getting hit with layoffs and furloughs, too.

Meanwhile, gig workers, independent contractors, and freelancers are experiencing income loss without the support of severance or benefits. (A 2018 report showed that nearly half of millennials freelance; a separate survey conducted in May 2019 found that almost half of millennials pursue side hustles in the gig economy to earn extra income.) Sixty-two percent of millennials reported living paycheck to paycheck last year, and even those who feel they have a “safe” job are wondering if it’s just a matter of time before they don’t.

As someone on the tail end of the millennial generation, I was lucky enough to still be in school when the 2008 recession hit. Yet financial anxiety has been an omnipresent part of how I see the world. It feels as though the one-time hallmarks of adulthood — buying a house, having kids, stability, even thinking about these things — are no longer milestones, but irresponsible dreams. Meanwhile, millennials older than me, many of whom are in their 30s and began their job searches in the thick of the 2008 recession, are even more financially fragile.

Research shows that those who start their working lives during a recession might get trapped in a “downward-shifted economic trajectory,” and the current downturn stands to derail millennials during a phase of life considered crucial for earning potential and major life choices, like having kids, saving for retirement, or potentially becoming caretakers for their own parents.

“To weather two economic crises — one near the beginning of your career and another midway through it — is a major blow,” Taylor Jo Isenberg, executive director of the Economic Security Project, told me.

Sixty-six percent of millennials have nothing saved for retirement (“what retirement?” you might be wondering); homeownership is 8 percentage points lower than it was for previous generations at the same age. For millennials in marginalized groups, it’s even worse, with starker inequities and lower wages. For example, only 16.2 percent of Hispanic workers and 19.7 percent of black Americans are able to work from home during this pandemic, according to a blog post by the Economic Policy Institute. As Annie Lowrey wrote for the Atlantic in 2019, “Millennial suffering won’t just hurt millennials” — it’s a drag on the economy as a whole.

These economic woes are as much structural as they are generationally specific. “Millennials aren’t just struggling with student loan debt,” said Signe-Mary McKernan, vice president of labor, human services, and population at the Urban Institute. “They’re also struggling with medical debt.”

The Urban Institute’s research shows that lower rates of insurance coverage and wealth accumulation make it a struggle for younger generations to pay off medical bills. Though the expectation in the US is for every generation to do better than the one before it, that isn’t necessarily the case for today’s young people, McKernan said. It’s not just about wealth in the academic sense, but about “building lives [and] security,” she said, and existing without a safety net during times we need it most.

Sixty-two percent of millennials reported living paycheck to paycheck last year.

The generation after millennials, it seems, won’t be much better off. College-aged Gen Z kids are graduating into a pandemic with financial side effects nearly impossible to fathom. A recent poll found that Gen Z-ers — people currently between the ages of 8 and 23, according to the Pew Research Center — are three times more likely to report losing their jobs or being put on leave as a result of the coronavirus, and many are watching their planned post-grad jobs or paid internships disappear before they’ve even gotten their diploma.

A 2018 survey from the American Psychological Association found that 81 percent of Gen Z said money was a major stressor, and it’s not hard to see why they’d be disenchanted with the myth that hard work and responsibility is enough. They grew up as witnesses to what their parents or siblings or older friends experienced: that nothing you ever do could possibly be enough to safeguard you, let alone get you ahead.

“Even the responsible things were pipe dreams,” someone in their early 30s recently told me during an interview. This person had done everything textbook-right, including picking a major (engineering) that’s supposed to provide a good return on investment, selecting the school that offered the most financial aid and scholarships, and working part-time while attending classes. But even making smart decisions and picking a practical field did not matter.

If we didn’t out-responsibility the last recession, it feels extraordinarily unlikely that we can have enough savings to combat a pandemic, given stagnant wages and job insecurity. Not even hustle culture and hyperproductivity can outrun economic circumstances from which we’re still reeling. I’ll keep worrying about health insurance, whether I’ll be lucky enough to keep my job, whether my younger sister’s generation will experience the powerlessness that stems from never really having power to begin with.

As Vega told me, “It feels like we’re getting hit just as we’re starting to figure out how to live. We have ongoing emotional trauma, skepticism, and overall burnout about trying to live a normal life with a normal paycheck.”

Everyone is negatively impacted by Covid-19 — it is going to deepen inequities for the most vulnerable among us. But for millennials, living with constant economic anxiety is our generational burden. We’ve been called the “lonely generation” or the “irresponsible generation,” but we stand to become the financial-crisis generation, too.

"['Kovie Biakolo', 'Apr']",2020-04-08,"What it means to “gather” for Easter, Passover, and Ramadan this year","Weeks after many places of worship had stopped in-person gatherings to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus, Rodney Howard-Browne, pastor of Tampa Bay Pentecostal megachurch the River, held two services, each drawing about 500 people, on March 30. In Florida, large gatherings hadn’t been banned yet; however, they were prohibited in Hillsborough County, where Howard-Browne was arrested the following day on charges of unlawful assembly and violating public health quarantine orders. A few days later, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis finally issued a “safer-at-home” order for the state but has kept open essential services. This includes places of worship.

DeSantis is not alone. The governors of Michigan, Ohio, and Kansas have enacted similar provisions for religious gatherings despite calls for stringent social distancing by public health officials. It’s a contentious stance that differs vastly from states like New York, hardest hit by the outbreak, and with some of the strictest orders in the country. But it’s also a divergent position from Nebraska and Iowa, among the handful of states that have refrained from any comprehensive mandate thus far, leaving it up to the local counties instead.

With Easter Sunday less than a week away, it’s not difficult to imagine that the actions of Howard-Browne might be repeated by Christian communities of faith across the country or across the world. Rev. Neichelle Guidry, the dean of Sisters Chapel at Spelman College in Atlanta certainly expects as much, even if she is disappointed by the prospect. “Until pastors face some sort of criminalization or consequence for willfully inviting people into mass gatherings, I think that there will be people who will continue to do that,” she said.

As many houses of worship prepare for upcoming holidays like Easter, as well as Passover and Ramadan, communities are utilizing the various technologies at their disposal, from real-time virtual “gatherings” in Zoom to prerecorded devotions via website portals. Where these digital initiatives were previously supplemental, they have now become the central means of convening during the pandemic — at least for those adhering to social distancing.

For compliant religious leaders, the challenge of the pandemic is reminding their congregants of the tenets of religion that are less about physical space and more about how not meeting during this time is an occasion for charity and empathy toward others.

Many congregations will host Easter services online — except those exercising religious freedom

Like many communities of faith, Guidry’s Sisters Chapel is using digital technologies, including streaming and social media, to keep worship and prayer services ongoing — although, given the community’s young demographic, they were already primed to do so.

In Indiana, where Rev. Shonda Nicole Gladden sometimes leads a typical congregation service of fewer than 100 people in an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) community in Indianapolis, the change from in-person to online gatherings was also relatively quick. A year and a half ago, the church had initiated training for its members to utilize digital resources because of concerns that bad weather or other incidents might keep people at home. Aside from livestreaming services and calling and writing letters to its members, the church’s initiative — “Wellness Wednesdays,” effectively a bible study led by Gladden — has included presentations by a medical doctor in the last few weeks to educate the community on the coronavirus.

To get through this time of physical distancing from her community, Gladden draws from the history of the AME church and its “hush harbor” roots — when enslaved black people met in secret to practice their religion. “We are very much still leaning into the history of the spiritual, the history of our faith, and trusting that the ‘God of our weary years,’ to use the language of the Negro national anthem, the ‘God of our silent tears,’ the ‘God who has brought us thus far on the way ... keep us forever in the path, we pray,’” she said.

In that vein, while she’s appreciative of virtual fellowship, Gladden also has concerns about privacy. “The ways that we would be able to seek sanctuary with one another, away from the prying eyes of government, of communities and demographics that are different than our own ... the increased surveillance and the potential for surveillance is what concerns me,” she said, referring to the long, documented history of the American government, along with co-conspiring white communities and individuals, spying on and policing black people. (In fact, there has been numerous reports of “Zoombombing” in recent weeks — harassers crashing meetings of Muslim and Jewish groups to say disruptive and racist things.)

Still, when it comes to the Easter holiday specifically, Gladden urges congregants to maintain social distancing, emphasizing that the liturgical calendar, though not “arbitrary,” is a “construct,” and is not something to be hung up on. Each Sunday is its own Easter observance, she said. “Every Sunday is a mini celebration of the Resurrection.”

This sentiment is shared by Rev. Joseph Jude Gannon, the parish priest of St. Gerard Majella, a Roman Catholic church in the Hollis section of Queens, New York. “We are a Resurrection people, and the Resurrection is more than just one day,” he said.

While many Christians understand that their faith is bigger than a physical building, some communities continue to meet, defying state orders. Over the weekend, on Palm Sunday — the beginning of the Holy Week that precedes Easter — Godspeak Calvary Chapel held services in Thousand Oaks, California, a state that does not consider houses of worship essential services. Outraged by the lack of social distancing, protesters honked their car horns as they lined up outside the church, the Los Angeles Times reported. The pastor, Rob McCoy, even resigned from the city council the night before, as he believed the state edict was in conflict with his religious freedom.

Then there are pastors like Howard-Browne, who have disregarded social distancing orders and opted for conspiracy theories. He believes the coronavirus is a “phantom plague” and a bioweapon created by the Chinese government to destroy the US economy. He’s joined by some other faith leaders across the country including Chuck Baldwin, the pastor of Liberty Fellowship in Kalispell, Montana, who does not believe the virus is a serious threat. Baldwin’s online sermon on March 15 floated the idea that the coronavirus was a possible hoax, and if not, a “psychological ops campaign against the American people” at the hands of the government and the media.

Meanwhile, a group of conservative Catholics is opposing the US bishops’ suspension of masses throughout the country with an online petition, “We Are An Easter People,” calling for priests to hold mass, especially on Easter. As of Tuesday, the petition had gathered over 12,000 signatures.

While many practicing Catholics across the world are currently dispensed from Sunday mass obligations, they have a plethora of online resources including livestreams of priests performing the ritual. Gannon, along with catechists and service leaders, is keeping the church’s food pantry going, alongside regularly calling members of the congregation to pray or just to check on them. Leaders are underscoring that though the building is closed, the church is not. From Gannon’s perspective, social distancing is about protecting vulnerable people and in accordance with the Church’s teachings on respect for life. Moreover, disobeying social restrictions to celebrate Easter would not be an act of faith. “That’s not being charitable, that’s not even being good or holy, that’s being selfish,” he said.

Last week, a friend of Gannon’s, Rev. Jorge Ortiz-Garay of St. Brigid’s church in Brooklyn, New York, became the first priest in the country to die from the virus. “It’s a personal loss, it’s a shepherding loss, but also the community would agree with this statement that he believed wholeheartedly in the Resurrection ... and he would be the first one to say the cross leads to the Resurrection so we have hope, you always have hope, you never despair,” said Gannon.

The struggle to celebrate Passover without extended family

Hope contextualized in faith will also be top of mind for many Jewish communities as they observe Passover beginning Wednesday evening. A seven- or eight-day feast commemorated since about 1300 BC, Passover remains a communal celebration with family and friends usually meeting on the first two nights for ritual Seder meals.

Given that Orthodox communities in New York and New Jersey have spurned state mandates and social distancing practices to gather for weddings and funerals over the past few weeks, it’s not unlikely that some families may also open up their homes for Passover. This may occur despite reports that some of these close-knit communities are hot spots for the virus, and despite the potential for subsequent anti-Semitic reactions from others. According to ABC News, officials in Lakewood, New Jersey, are concerned not only about the Orthodox communities’ indifference to social distancing but any possible reprisal others may have toward the communities for perceivably or actually breaking the rules.

For Jews in other communities celebrating Passover, the temptation to meet cannot be ignored, even by those who oppose it. “I imagine there may be somewhere, people who decide, ‘Oh, we’re going to get together for our Seder and we’ll just be at different card tables or something’ ... there’s always somebody who wants to push the edge of the envelope,” Elizabeth Berke, a cantor at Anshe Emet synagogue in Chicago, Illinois, told Vox.

Even for Jewish people who are not particularly religious such as Jack Doppelt, a professor of journalism at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, celebrating the holiday is significant. It allows him to recall his childhood, especially fond memories of his father. “Passover is the holiday that means the most to me, and that has to do with my dad. It was his favorite holiday ... it was a community event for me and my family,” he said.

In accordance with the social distancing restrictions, Doppelt won’t engage in a normal Passover Seder this year, although he did write and make public a Haggadah that anyone can use. “It was my way of sharing the meaningfulness to me of the holiday with others when I couldn’t do it in the traditional way,” said Doppelt.

At Anshe Emet, a Conservative synagogue, the senior rabbi and a cantor will prerecord a Seder for people to use for parts of their Seders at home, says Berke, who went through a mourning period coming to terms with being away from extended family for Passover. She’s planning to gather virtually like many others but is concerned about those who cannot. “I do worry about the senior population who may not have the capability or the comfort or just even the technology in their home,” she said.

Attached to a day school, the synagogue initially shut down for one day after the Jewish holiday Purim in early March after a parent of one of the children was diagnosed with Covid-19. While the school closed and the buildings were cleaned, the synagogue still held services that weekend. Few people showed up, and those who did positioned themselves far apart from each other. “By the following week, we said, ‘Okay, we’re just going to be livestreaming and just have a rabbi and a cantor there on the bema, the stage at the front of the sanctuary, and livestream our services with no congregation,’” said Berke.

The use of virtual technologies to observe services is a source of debate in the Conservative movement’s Committee on Jewish Laws and Standards — some synagogues ordinarily don’t allow streaming while others do, with stipulations. “Before this, we only livestreamed services that were not on a Shabbat or a holiday because there are different implications of Jewish law regarding the use of electronics,” Berke said. There is also the matter of a minyan, a congregational quorum required for certain prayers that is now being presumed as occurring digitally, at least at Anshe Emet.

“This is considered a case of emergency, which means you can sort of overlook some of those strictures in Jewish law,” said Berke. “There’s always been that space in Jewish law. There’s an idea called pikuach nefesh. Pikuach nefesh is the idea of, to save a life, put everything else aside.”

A focus on social responsibility for Ramadan instead of physically praying together

The notion of preserving life is also central to Islam; in fact, it’s one of the faith’s five main principles. As such, the spread of the coronavirus has led to lifting the obligation of Jumu’ah, or Friday prayers. Instead, Muslim communities such as New York University’s Islamic Center are utilizing digital spaces to gather.

“We’re having discussion groups ... communal prayers, more in the sense of invocation prayers rather than our ritualistic, five-times-a-day prayer,” said Imam Khalid Latif, the head of the center and one of the university’s chaplains.

NYU’s Islamic Center is also offering more than spiritual guidance and community. Its online programs include mental health staff who engage groups online, yoga and meditation classes, and storytime for children. They’ve even had people offer writing workshops and financial planning training. Additionally, in collaboration with other nonprofit organizations, the center is running a digital campaign to raise funds for those financially affected by the pandemic. Currently, they have obtained over half a million dollars, sums of which are distributed rapidly — sometimes within a day — to those who qualify via a grant system based on need. For Latif, the current mission is about responding to a crisis practically as much as accomplishing obligations of faith. “[It] was a way to create cohesion but also fulfill a lot of the social responsibility that our religion teaches us,” he said.

As the pandemic rages on, social distancing restrictions will likely still be in place in many parts of the country when Ramadan begins on April 23, and potentially through the holy month’s conclusion and commemoration on Eid. A time for fasting and prayer, Ramadan is also a communal time for Muslims, who often enjoy iftar (fast-breaking) meals in large gatherings.

The tradition will be missed by many this year, including Temple University rising senior Hafeezat Bishi. Before the virus kept her in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bishi had planned to go home to New Jersey once the semester was over to complete Ramadan with her family. She imagined this year’s Ramadan as one of the last she would get to celebrate at her childhood mosque, Yankasa Masjid, in the Bronx, New York, a largely West African community.

“I really miss the support and familiarity it brought me. Being around other Africans ... that was the most time I spent around people who are similar to me in that fashion. Because I didn’t have that same surroundings back in my home in Jersey or at school,” said Bishi, who is Nigerian American.

Bishi also expects that while many in the community will adhere to social distancing during Ramadan and possibly Eid, some might gather at home or elsewhere. “I’m certain that one or two families might just go to the park and enjoy themselves, but I know others might be urged to stay inside,” she said.

While the prayer service on Eid is not an obligation and therefore does not require an exemption, Ramadan’s basic tenets remain during the pandemic. “The fast is going to still embody the same mechanics and steps, but the manner in which people approach it will have to be a little bit different,” Latif said.

He recognizes the anguish in being unable to gather, but he also believes breaking social distancing during the month opposes its very essence. “It goes against the fundamental concept of Ramadan itself, which isn’t about empty stomachs, but it’s about full hearts,” Latif said. “And it’s teaching us to look at things through a different prism, really, in pursuit of true beauty and goodness.”

He also had a message that perhaps applies to people of all faiths and none: “There’s an opportunity to think in a bigger sphere, as to how we’re all connected to each other and how our actions impact one another.”

"['Coleman Lowndes', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,How images of the coronavirus are made,"The images of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that first appeared in humans in late 2019, were made using electron microscopy. This type of microscope can show us things much smaller than what we can see with a standard light microscope — like the coronavirus.

The virus measures around 100 nanometers, and the smallest wavelengths of light that humans can see measure around 400 nanometers. To see something that small, you need a device that uses smaller wavelengths than light. To accomplish this, an electron microscope accelerates electrons in a field until they behave as a tiny wavelength.

Two electron microscopy techniques, SEM and TEM, offer different views. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) scans the surface of a sample and records information that bounces back, similar to a satellite image. A Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) transmits electrons through a sample and projects a cross-section of its inner structure. Together, these images help scientists observe the virus and how it moves in and out of host cells.

Correction: The animation in the video at 4:07 implies that antibodies coat the entire cell membrane, when they actually bind to specific proteins on the virus.

"['Phil Edwards', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-08,Why NASA quarantined the Apollo 11 astronauts,"On July 21, 1969, the Apollo 11 quarantine began.

As shown in the video above, it was an unusual process for an unprecedented task: keeping potential moon germs from entering the Earth’s atmosphere (and affecting its population).

To isolate the Apollo astronauts from Earth, NASA went to extraordinary lengths, clothing them in “biological isolation garments,” transporting them on a converted Airstream trailer, and quarantining them for weeks in a Lunar Receiving Lab built specially for analyzing moon samples — and, of course, for holding the men who went there.

The quarantine was a strange capstone to the journey to the moon — but a necessary one that’s surprisingly resonant today.

Watch the conversation above to learn more.

NASA has an excellent flight journal chronicling the quarantine.

The National Archives maintains a treasure trove of Apollo 11 footage. Searching the catalog can be a bit clunky, but the results are astonishing (and helped make this video). You can see search results for the Mobile Quarantine Facility (abbreviated as MQF) here.

NASA also has multiple oral histories that relate to the quarantine. This one with John Hirasaki is a good place to start.

"['Joss Fong Cleo Abram', 'Joss Fong', 'Cleo Abram', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-02,Why coronavirus scammers can send fake emails from real domains,"On March 18, an email went out from the World Health Organization soliciting donations for its Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund, to support WHO’s work tracking and treating the novel coronavirus. The sender address was “donate@who.int,” and who.int is the real domain name of the organization.

But the email is a scam. It was not sent from the WHO, but from an impersonator looking to profit off our tendency toward generosity during a global crisis. Fortunately, the attacker revealed themselves by asking for donations in bitcoin.

This is just one of many fake emails that have spoofed the WHO’s domain name during the coronavirus pandemic. Some are addressed from Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, and carry attachments that can install malware on the victim’s device. Others announce a coronavirus cure that you can read all about in the attachment. They each appear to be sent from a who.int email address.

If it seems like it shouldn’t be this easy to impersonate a leading global health institution, you’re right. As we outline in the video at the top of this post, there is a way for organizations and companies to prevent spoofing of their domain, but the WHO hasn’t done it.

“One of the things that a lot of NGOs and nonprofits don’t necessarily understand is that email is a very open protocol by design,” said Ryan Kalember, who leads cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint.

That “open protocol” means that the email transmission system itself doesn’t verify the identity of senders. Instead, senders and receivers have had to organize voluntary authentication methods: Domain owners can adopt an ID system, and email providers can check for for those IDs. But participation has not been universal on both sides.

“There are just so many organizations that don’t authenticate their mail. So if you are interested in tricking someone, that becomes an incredibly useful vector to do so,” said Kalember.

There are three main pieces of jargon to learn when it comes to email authentication systems. There’s SPF (Sender Policy Framework), through which a domain owner can specify that legitimate emails always come from a certain set of IP addresses. There’s DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail), which relies on a unique signature to verify senders.

And then there’s DMARC, which builds on SPF and DKIM by specifying how the receiving email service should treat messages that fail those tests (do nothing, send to spam, or reject the message altogether). It also provides a feedback system so that domain-owners can learn about messages passing or failing checks from their domain.

Setting a strong DMARC policy is the surest way to prevent domain spoofing, and all major email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo, will check incoming emails against a DMARC record.

The WHO has enabled SPF but there is no DMARC record for who.int as of April 1, 2020. “The SPF record is a good thing to have, but without a corresponding DMARC policy, it won’t unfortunately result in spoofed messages being blocked,” Kalember said.

Sure enough, we ran some experiments with help from Dylan Tweney at Valimail, an email cybersecurity company, and easily placed a spoofed who.int email into our Yahoo inbox. Outlook and Gmail caught it in their spam filters, the last line of defense. We also tried spoofing voxmedia.com and cdc.gov, and neither reached an inbox. Both have strong DMARC policies in place.

A study conducted in 2018 by researchers at Virginia Tech similarly found that their experimental phishing email “penetrated email providers that perform full authentications when spoofing sender domains that do not have a strict reject DMARC policy.”

Unfortunately, it’s extremely common for domains to lack a strict reject DMARC policy. WHO is joined by whitehouse.gov, defense.gov, redcross.org, unicef.org, and the health agencies of Washington, California, Italy, South Korea, and Spain, among many others.

According to a recent report by Valimail, more and more domains are setting DMARC records, but less than 15 percent of those with a DMARC record actually have a “reject” policy to prevent spoofed emails from being delivered.

“The current situation is that not everybody is doing it. So essentially the problem is that you cannot punish other people for not doing it. You cannot just block their emails automatically because you will not receive legitimate emails from them,” said Gang Wang, professor of computer science at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

Wang and his colleagues interviewed email administrators in 2018 to investigate the low adoption rates of the authentication systems and found that “email administrators believe the current protocol adoption lacks the crucial mass due to the protocol defects, weak incentives, and practical deployment challenges.”

The authentication systems can be difficult to configure for organizations that allow many third-party vendors to send emails, or that use forwarding and email lists. If DMARC is not set up carefully, legitimate emails might not get through, which may weigh heavily in the cost-benefit calculation for organizations. According to one of Wang’s survey respondents:

“Strict enforcement requires identifying all the legitimate sources of email using a return address domain. Large, decentralized organizations (e.g. many large universities), will often have organizational units which acquire third-party services involving email, like email marketing tools, without telling central IT. Figuring all this out and putting policies and procedures in place to prevent it is more work than many admins have time for.”

The benefit of protecting unknown victims from potential fake emails marked with your domain name may be less obvious than the costs, in everyday contexts. But right now, as cyber criminals deploy coronavirus lures en masse and we’re all desperate for information from authorities, the benefits seem much more clear.

The WHO did not respond to our request for comment.

Update, April 8, 2020: The WHO has now published a DMARC record, but has not set a DMARC policy that would prevent domain spoofing. This is an action some organizations take to gather information before enabling stronger protections.

"['Madeline Marshall', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-01,Coronavirus is not the flu. It’s worse.,"Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, can look very similar to the flu. They have similar symptoms — a fever, cough, and the possibility of leading to pneumonia — and even spread the same way. So wanting to compare the two is natural and, frankly, understandable.

But Covid-19 is very different from the flu. It’s more dangerous in almost every way.

Not only is it twice as contagious, but the time it takes you to realize you are contagious is much longer. With the flu, the average time it takes you to feel sick from the moment you become sick (called the incubation period) is two days.

With Covid-19, most people don’t realize they’re sick — and possibly contagious — for five days; it can take up to 12 or even 14 days. You can also show no symptoms and still be contagious.

And when you become sick, you have a higher chance of needing to be hospitalized. (Yes, even young people.) While the flu can kill nearly 60,000 Americans in a year, the flu’s fatality rate is still just 0.1 percent. Covid-19’s fatality rate by some estimates is 10 times that, especially for older people.

It’s a policy that isn’t just rooted in generosity — during pandemics like the novel coronavirus, it can literally save lives.

When workers have to choose between earning a living and staying home sick, it incentivizes them to come to work when they’re ill and potentially infect their colleagues and anyone else they come into contact with. That’s why public health officials are concerned that millions of American workers don’t have access to paid sick days.

A disproportionate share of those workers are concentrated in occupations like food service and hospitality, where there’s the potential to infect the hundreds of customers many of them interact with every day. Those with paid sick days or the ability to work from home are at risk, too, since many of the people delivering food and other necessities don’t have that right.

When it comes to the coronavirus, we’re only as protected as our most vulnerable neighbors.

We asked an expert.,"The message from public health officials around the world has been unified and clear: To slow the spread of coronavirus, social distancing is among our best weapons.

The learning curve for how seriously we should be taking social distancing has been steep. Senators have still been using the gym. Spring breakers have still fled to beaches. People in Washington, DC, still flocked to witness the cherry blossoms bloom.

Social epidemiologist Carolyn Cannuscio says there is no happy medium when it comes to social distancing, if we’re doing it right. “I think it’s time for us to take very extreme measures in our personal lives. I think our lives should look radically different right now than they normally do.”

She says we can draw on two different sources of information that prove the efficacy of social distancing and outbreaks. School closures, if done early and long enough, have been effective in slowing the spread of pandemic flu.

The Chinese government’s recent response to the coronavirus is another good source. “The social distancing measures were imposed governmentally, and they were enforced through things like monitoring by drones, monitoring by apps, measures that probably would not be palatable to most Americans.” Cannuscio said.

“But what China managed to do in a densely populated area and Wuhan, where the outbreak originated, was to bend the curve and to really achieve this downturn in the case counts, so that the newly constructed hospitals, for example, are now largely empty. And they had to do that by restricting movement of the population and by emptying the schools.”

In short, Cannuscio recommends limiting our presence in public spaces to only the most necessary outings. Many of her words of caution — don’t go to the gym, concerts, movie theaters — are solved by government-mandated lockdowns of non-essential businesses. Many of us no longer have that option. But it could help us think twice about even small gatherings of friends, whether to succumb to the formalities of a hug or a handshake, or going out for walks or errands during high-traffic times.

“And when we’re under stress, many of us crave the contact and support of our loved ones and friends. So this will be a very hard time for many people,” Cannuscio says. “And I would say that the happy medium is to try to think creatively about ways to engage socially without physically being present, without that face-to-face contact.”

It’s true. But why?

It’s because soap — regular soap, fancy honeysuckle soap, artisan soap, just any soap — absolutely annihilates viruses. It has to do with how the soap molecules interact with the virus.

Soap is made up of two-sided molecules. One side is attracted to water; the other side is attracted to fat. And viruses are made up of material surrounded by a coating of proteins and fat. When viruses interact with soap, that fat coating gets ripped out by the soap molecules. Soap literally demolishes viruses.

Of course, it takes time for this effect to happen: 20 seconds, to be specific.

The law fast-tracks citizenship for migrants from three neighboring countries, specifically if they are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians. It conspicuously leaves out Muslims.

Since the law was passed, it’s drawn widespread opposition and protests, and not only because it discriminates against Muslims. The law is also closely linked to another controversial initiative: the National Registry of Citizens, a citizenship list that could potentially leave millions of people, primarily Muslims, stateless.

So far, only the northeastern state of Assam has implemented the NRC. In August 2019, the government of Assam published a citizenship list that left off nearly 2 million residents. And without the citizenship fast-track that the Citizenship Amendment Act grants other religions, the Muslims left off that list are at risk of losing their citizenship entirely.

"['Ranjani Chakraborty', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar', 'Melissa Hirsch']",2020-03-10,The Filipino neighborhood San Francisco destroyed,"San Francisco has struggled with a notorious affordable housing crisis. But the history of that crisis goes far beyond the city’s tech boom.

In the 1960s, as San Francisco officials pushed plans for the “Manhattanization” of its downtown area — their master plan targeted the removal of tens of thousands of low-income residents. By 1968, one community decided to fight back. They lived in San Francisco’s Manilatown, a once-thriving neighborhood where much of the city’s Filipino population lived. For many in Manilatown, the only affordable places to live were small, cheap rooms in residential hotels.

In the coming years, the development of the Financial District would nearly swallow all of Manilatown — except for one structure: a residential hotel called the International Hotel. The fight to save its elderly tenants from eviction, and to preserve the last vestige of Manilatown, would evolve into a nearly decade-long battle that came to a head on one violent night in 1977.

Watch the video above to see how that night unfolded, and why it was this fight that brought together thousands of supporters and became a symbol of the campaign for affordable housing for decades to come.

"['Sam Ellis', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-06,Why new diseases keep appearing in China,"On December 31, 2019, the Chinese government issued an alert to the World Health Organization about a new illness that was spreading through the city of Wuhan. Patients were coming down with a mysterious fever, dry cough, and pneumonia. Soon, some were dying. The source was a new virus, named SARS-CoV-2, and health officials were racing to find the source.

A leading hypothesis is that the virus emerged from animals at a popular market in Wuhan. This is not a surprise for many experts because it’s happened before. In 2003, a virus very similar to SARS-CoV-2 emerged from a market in Foshan, China. It caused the SARS disease, which spread to dozens of countries and killed nearly 800 people. SARS-CoV-2 has developed into a much wider outbreak, reaching all across the globe and killing thousands.

The similarities between the two viruses raises the question: Why do new diseases keep emerging from China? This episode of Vox Atlas examines the deeper issue of China’s wildlife trade and how it’s putting global health at risk.

It’s important to note that, as our expert Peter Li points out in the video, “The majority of the people in China do not eat wildlife animals. Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful — a small minority.”

"['Joss Fong', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-04,The era of fake writing is upon us,"Until 2019, it has been the case that if you come across several paragraphs of text on a consistent topic with consistent subjects, you can assume that text was written or structured by a human being. That is no longer true.

Over the past year, AI researchers designed computer programs with the ability to generate multi-paragraph stories that remain fairly coherent throughout. As we explain in the video above, these programs create passages of text that seem like they were written by someone who is fluent in the language but possibly faking their knowledge. I’m not sure we needed an automated version of that person, but here it is:

Depending on how you look at it, this technology is a powerful bullshit machine or a promising tool for artists. So far, the creative uses seem to outnumber the malicious ones, but it’s not difficult to imagine how text-fakes could cause harm, especially since these models have been widely shared and are now deployable by anyone with basic know-how.

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) didn’t set out to create a fake news machine. Rather, this is the byproduct of a line of research into massive language models — machine learning programs that build vast statistical maps of the correlations between words. They look at a sample of text and guess the next word based on how frequently that word appeared in similar contexts in the training data.

That sounds simple but it’s an incredibly challenging task. They need to account for the fact that different words can have different meanings depending on the context. They need to be able to sort out which pronouns refer to which nouns. And they need to keep track of long-range dependencies, which are words whose meanings hinge on other words that are relatively far away. Since most computer models in the past were focused on the immediate context, they couldn’t continue a consistent idea or story.

That has changed for two reasons. First, these models are now “pretrained” on way more data than before, millions of articles pulled from the internet. And second, the computers are able to handle that amount of data because researchers adopted a new technique called “Transformer,” which allows for a more efficient use of computing power. The result is that the models can access more contextual information about each word and therefore make more plausible sentence predictions.

Over the past few years, pretrained language models have enabled huge strides across a number of language tasks. Text generation is key part of language translation, chatbots, question-answering, and summarization. The problem is that in their simplest form, when they’re prompted to do open-ended generation, language models are indifferent to the truth. That’s what makes them creative, but it also puts them on the wrong side of the battle against trolls, propagandists, and con artists online.

Bots roam the internet in huge numbers, primarily deceiving other computers. Now, with a decent handle on our language, they have new ways of deceiving humans directly. Certainly it’s been possible to simply hire people to write posts, fake reviews, and misinformation. What this tool adds is scale, language fluency, and the ability to mirror the jargon and writing style of any profession or, with enough samples, any individual.

The recent advances in language modeling mean that voice assistants will get better, chatbots will get better, and businesses will have better ways of analyzing documents. But for the places where humans gather online to talk to other humans, the internet will get a little worse.

French art and the Louvre were struggling when Venus was discovered. A large cache of art, looted by Napoleon from around the world, had recently been returned to various home countries, and that left a huge gap in the Louvre’s classical art collection. Venus was the perfect solution — and the French went to extreme lengths to make sure nobody questioned her legitimacy. The result was a globally famous statue with a complicated and secretive history.

In 2020, that process consists of 64 different contests, held on 22 different days from February to June.

And for the past 50 years, this process has started in Iowa, moved to New Hampshire, and then headed to other small states on this slog to the conventions. How did this become our system?

We can thank the protests at the 1968 Democratic Convention. Then, only a few states held primaries, and party leaders chose the party’s presidential nominee. That year, young Democrats favored anti-war candidates. But at the convention, the party chose a pro-war candidate: then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who wasn’t even on a ballot in the primaries.

After those protests, the Democrats — and the Republicans soon after — changed their systems so every state holds a primary. They wanted the voters to actually have a voice.

Now we have what’s called a “sequential primary system.” Starting in small states, the number of candidates gets winnowed down to just a few for the rest of the country. But those first states with the most influence, like Iowa, weren’t chosen by the party on purpose. It was just random.

"['Laura Bult', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Feb']",2020-02-19,How the British royal family makes its money,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex took the whole world by surprise when they announced that they would seek financial independence from the British monarchy. In their announcement, they clarified that this meant giving up the part of their income that comes from the British taxpayers.

But that’s not the only way the royal family as a whole makes its money. The British royal family is essentially a very wealthy landlord. Its members aren’t allowed to work aside from their official duties, but they can collect rent and profits from the numerous estates that are historically affiliated with them. These inherited estates form part of the Queen’s net worth, which, in 2019, was estimated to be about £370 million.

It also makes an income from two other massive real estate portfolios, called the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall. These include castle ruins that are now tourist attractions, but also whole villages, commercial real estate, and a cricket stadium in London. These portfolios made just over £20 million each in 2019; the money from the Duchy of Lancaster goes to Queen Elizabeth, and the Cornwall income goes to Prince Charles.

The income Harry and Meghan receive from British taxpayers is where things get tricky, and it represents a sort of pact between the British public and the monarchy. The British monarchy once owned a lot of the iconic real estate that draws millions of tourists every year — the Tower of London, Windsor Castle, and Buckingham Palace, to name a few.

King George III handed these properties over to the government during his rule, and in exchange, the royal family receive a percentage of the profits from these properties in taxpayer money every year. These properties are known as the Crown Estate, which has grown to be an extremely profitable portfolio that includes commercial real estate in London.

In exchange for that money, the royal family members are beholden to strict rules that dictate how they earn income and how much access they give to an aggressive press corps. They also have to follow standards to maintain the family’s brand and image so they can continue to draw tourists and tourism money to the UK every year.

Because royals aren’t allowed to work outside of their official duties, and because a lot of the real estate the family earns income from doesn’t actually belong to it, the illusion of the royal family’s private wealth is greater than its actual net worth. Queen Elizabeth, the richest royal family member, is the 356th richest person in the UK, for example.

In that regard, the couple’s “Megxit” may have been a financially savvy move. They’re able to hold on to their private inheritance and possibly also the income from the Duchies, while having the freedom to make income outside of this model by breaking free from the rules that come from taxpayer funding.

"['Umair Irfan', 'May']",2020-05-01,Why even a super-accurate Covid-19 test can fail,"The persistent shortfall in genetic and antibody testing for the Covid-19 coronavirus in the United States remains a major hurdle to understanding — and controlling — the pandemic.

Public health officials know that some infected people can spread the virus without showing symptoms, sometimes for weeks. That makes testing to identify and isolate the infected the most important way to slow the spread of the virus. But the shortage of tests means officials don’t yet know how many are still out there, or how many have already recovered.

It also turns out that the tests are not always that great. Both the genetic tests for Covid-19 (that look for active infections) and the serological antibody tests (that can identify past infections) have had issues with accuracy.

Scientists at the Cleveland Clinic found that one popular rapid genetic test told users they didn’t have the virus when they actually did about 15 percent of the time. Meanwhile, researchers in California studied 14 antibody tests on the market, some that were granted emergency use authorizations by the Food and Drug Administration, and found that only three of them delivered consistent results. These findings add another layer of fog on top of an already murky situation.

The US remains desperate for more tests, and companies like Quest Diagnostics are now offering more flexible options like at-home Covid-19 antibody testing to meet the demand. Some health officials have warned, though, that this pressure has led to a surge of inaccurate tests on the market.

Yet the bigger challenge isn’t the tests themselves, but the entire endeavor of calculating the prevalence of a brand new infectious disease like Covid-19.

Understanding the tricky math at play here could help us better make sense of test results and get a grip on the pandemic. So let’s dive in.

The tricky trade-off behind testing for Covid-19

The fundamental problem is that even the best tests struggle to find something that’s rare. That’s true if you’re looking for a novel virus, a form of cancer, or a genetic illness. While there have now been more than a million confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the United States, it’s still a tiny share of the overall population. So people who are currently infected or who have survived the virus are still scarce.

To understand why testing for an uncommon virus like this can be so challenging, it helps to understand the theory behind it.

Tests are evaluated on two key metrics: specificity and sensitivity. Sensitivity is the likelihood that a test will detect your target. A highly sensitive test will have a low false negative rate. It’s especially good at turning up a positive result when your target is actually there.

Specificity is the likelihood that the test won’t be fooled by something other than the intended target. A test with high specificity will have a low false positive rate. It excels at producing a negative result when your target isn’t there.

These traits are often in tension. Making a test more specific can make it less sensitive and vice versa — If you cast a wider net, you can’t be as picky about what you catch. Advancing on both fronts is possible in some cases, but it’s difficult, and it’s almost impossible to make a test that’s perfectly sensitive and specific.

The prevalence of the disease influences the chances of a correct test result

For patients getting tested, the main concern is how to interpret the outcome: If I test negative with an RT-PCR genetic test, what are the chances I actually have the virus? Or if I test positive with an antibody test, does it actually mean I have the antibodies?

It turns out that the answers to these questions don’t just hinge on the accuracy of the test. “Mathematically, the way that works out, that actually depends on how many people in your area have Covid,” Eleanor Murray, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Boston University School of Public Health, said.

However, it’s tough to figure out the total number of people who have been infected with Covid-19. With untold numbers of people spreading the virus and with many not showing symptoms at all, it’s hard to say how many people currently have the virus or have antibodies to it. There are estimates that can be drawn from data like hospital visits and deaths.

But oddly, one of the best ways to understand the value of an individual test result is to test a large group of people at random. You can estimate the spread of a virus in a population with a serological survey (a.k.a. serosurvey), even with a less-than-perfect test. Then you can account for false results using statistical techniques in your analysis.

“The thing with the population-based surveys is even if they are not perfect in terms of their accuracy and operating characteristics, you can adjust for that,” said Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. “If the tests perform worse, there is going to be more uncertainty in the final answer. ... The end result is that you can kind of say that something is low [prevalence], but you can’t precisely say it’s 1 percent or 2 percent or 3 percent.”

These probabilities — the accuracy of the test and the prevalence of the virus in a population — can be tied together in a statistical formula known as Bayes’ theorem to show how to interpret a Covid-19 test. In short, Bayes’ theorem calculates the odds of one outcome given another related outcome. For example, given a positive test result, what is the probability that it’s true?

Let’s say we have a hypothetical Covid-19 test for antibodies that is both 99 percent sensitive — meaning almost all people with antibodies will test positive — and 99 percent specific, meaning almost all people who were never infected will yield a negative result.

If you test a group of 100 uninfected people, odds are one of them will still test positive even though they don’t have the virus. Conversely, if you test 100 people who were infected, it’s likely one of them will still test negative.

Now let’s presume the virus has a prevalence rate of 1 percent, so one person in 100 carries antibodies to it. If you test 100 random people and get a positive result, what is the chance that this person was truly infected?

Deborah Birx, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, explained the answer at a press conference on April 20: “So if you have 1 percent of your population infected and you have a test that’s only 99 percent specific, that means that when you find a positive, 50 percent of the time will be a real positive and 50 percent of the time it won’t be.”

It may seem a little counterintuitive that a 99 percent specific test could yield a 50-50 result. But Bayes’ theorem shows that at a lower prevalence rate of the virus, false positives make up a larger share of the results. You can see how it plays out in the graph below showing the positive predictive value of the test:

At the same time, as the prevalence rate increases, so does the likelihood of a correct result. If 10 percent of people in a population are infected, a positive test result is more than 90 percent likely to mean that antibodies are truly present.

“[W]hether 2% or 20% of tests come back positive makes a huge difference in how confident we are in any individual positive result being correct,” said Zachary Binney, an epidemiologist at Emory University, in an email. “A bit weird-feeling, I know, but it’s the truth.”

How to test better

To use and interpret these tests effectively, first remember what the test is actually detecting. With a genetic test like an RT-PCR test, you are detecting the genetic material of a virus, not necessarily the active virus itself. As researchers in South Korea discovered, the virus’s genetic material can linger even after the infection is extinguished, yielding a false positive test result.

A serological test looks for antibodies, which play a crucial role in the body’s immune response to Covid-19. It can take several days for an infected person to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. So a negative result doesn’t necessarily mean that the virus isn’t present. On the other hand, a positive antibody test doesn’t always mean you are immune, nor does it mean that the virus has been defeated.

With a genetic test, the main fear is that a false negative could leave someone to spread the virus unwittingly, so it makes sense to emphasize sensitivity. That way, it will pick up more actual cases, with the trade-off that some positive results might not be correct.

With a serological test, a false positive could give someone a false sense of security for having survived the virus and lead to riskier behavior. So these tests should be weighted toward specificity. That way, they’re less likely to tell people they have the antibodies when they don’t (with the trade-off that some people with antibodies will get a negative test result).

Another thing to consider is how you are planning to use the information from the tests. If you are trying to diagnose an infection in an individual patient with an RT-PCR test, it pays to also consider other factors like symptoms and how the patient was exposed. It may be worthwhile to perform a second test at a later date or using a different method.

Similarly, serological testing can also be improved by repeated testing. “If we give you a second [different] test, the chances of having two random positives in a row is much lower than the chance of having one random positive,” Murray said. “If you actually are not positive, then the second test will be negative. Doing multiple tests is a way of getting a more accurate result for any individual.”

The White House now recommends doing two antibody tests per patient to get a reliable estimate of the spread of the virus, ideally with tests from two different manufacturers to minimize the risk of the same problem repeating itself.

It’s also important to keep track of how prevalent the virus is in your population; it can change a lot from place to place. One controversial estimate of the prevalence of Covid-19 in Santa Clara County, California, found that up to 4.1 percent of residents had been infected, although the finding was not drawn from a random sample.

“I think the Santa Clara numbers, for example, are almost — not quite — meaningless, but very close to meaningless,” Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch said on a call with reporters Thursday. “Because almost all of it could be false positives.”

New York state, however, where prevalence is clearly much higher, is a different story. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on April 23 that early results of a statewide serosurvey found that 13.9 percent of people in the state have antibodies to Covid-19. In New York City, that number rose to 21.2 percent of residents.

“The numbers coming out from a place like New York are probably very reliable — not perfectly reliable, but the most reliable,” said Lipsitch.

Despite all the caveats, testing remains one of the most valuable tools for controlling the Covid-19 pandemic. And right now, the biggest hurdle isn’t the accuracy of the tests but the scale at which they are deployed.

Many researchers agree that the United States needs to be testing millions of people per day, yet the country is struggling to test more than 200,000 in a day. And since a test is just a snapshot in time, many people, particularly in high-risk jobs, will have to be tested over and over. While more accurate tests will always be welcome, no matter what, we’ll need more of them.

"['Ella Nilsen', 'Apr']",2020-04-03,How to apply for coronavirus unemployment benefits in every state,"Millions of newly laid-off Americans are now wondering how to access government unemployment benefits as they scramble to cover rent, groceries, and other daily necessities. Vox is here to help readers navigate the bureaucracy.

Congress has significantly expanded unemployment insurance as part of its historic $2 trillion CARES Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump. Laid-off or furloughed Americans who file for unemployment through their states will see an extra $600 per week added on to that existing state benefit. The average benefit in the US is about $385 per week, but some states are more generous than others.

There are a few key things to know about this new law, as my colleague Dylan Matthews recently explained. First and foremost, it adds $600 to every weekly unemployment check. Second, more people now qualify for unemployment insurance than before. The law creates a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for freelancers, independent contractors, or gig economy workers who previously were ineligible for unemployment insurance.

The law also makes benefits easier to access by waiving some states’ requirements for people to look for work. These programs will provide people the increased assistance for four months — late March until July. And with many states still setting up their Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs, benefits will be paid out retroactively. That means even if workers can’t apply for benefits until May, they will ultimately still receive what they are owed from the time they were laid off.

“The UI provisions in the CARES Act were some of — if not the — strongest provisions of the act,” said labor economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute and formerly part of the Obama administration. “It will alleviate the hardship of millions of people.”

People who have already filed for regular unemployment benefits because they were laid off from a job should be starting to see the expanded benefit show up in their checks. The process could be a bit more complex for contract or self-employed workers who need to file for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and are waiting for states to set up these programs.

But because so many people are filing for unemployment all at once, it is causing frustrating delays. Many are experiencing jammed phone lines, and many state unemployment websites have crashed with the high demand, including states like New York, Florida, and Michigan.

“The system’s a little clogged up right now,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. “People should keep trying.” Evermore noted that even if some workers are being told they’re not eligible immediately, that could change in the coming weeks as states start receiving the federal money and set up the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program.

“The states need resources in order to administer the UI,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Vox recently. “Some are much better prepared than others or just have a different timetable. So one of the things we may have to do is get more resources to the state agencies that do this.”

Vox crowdsourced common questions from readers and contacted experts to answer them. Here’s our guide on how to access unemployment benefits, who is covered, and much more.

Your unemployment insurance questions, answered

How much does my state offer in base unemployment benefits? And where do I apply?

Here’s a chart that shows each state’s minimum and maximum weekly unemployment benefit, as well as a link to each state’s unemployment office. People can apply online or over the phone, though many states are recommending online applications due to busy phone lines.

Each state has its own guidance, but due to high demand, some states are advising people to call on certain days or at certain times depending on the alphabetical order of their last names or order of their Social Security numbers. Check your state’s website to find out if there are specific guidelines.

Who qualifies for this expanded unemployment insurance program?

The CARES Act opened up unemployment benefits to a range of people who weren’t eligible before, including gig economy workers like drivers for Uber or Lyft, freelancers, and independent contractors. Part-time employees who lost their jobs due to coronavirus will also be covered, as will people who had to stop working to take care of a sick member of their family or homeschool their children.

Bottom line: If coronavirus is responsible for your layoff, furlough, or drastic reduction of your hours — or is preventing you from looking for work because fewer employers are hiring — you have a good chance of getting these expanded benefits. It’s worth applying even if you are unsure if you’ll be covered.

Who doesn’t qualify for this expanded unemployment insurance program?

People who are working from home but still getting a full wage are not eligible for benefits. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible; neither are new entrants into the workforce, like recent college graduates, because they don’t have a long enough work history to apply for benefits.

What documentation do I need to sign up for unemployment insurance?

States ask for some basic information during the application process, including:

Your name, birth date, and Social Security number

Your last employer’s information, including company name, supervisor’s name, address, and phone number

The last date you worked and the reason you are no longer working

Your gross earnings in the last week you worked (starting Sunday and ending with your last day on the job)

You may also be asked about other employers you worked for in the past 18 months, including the employer name, address, dates of employment, gross wages earned, hours worked per week and hourly rate of pay, and the reason you are no longer working.

This means keeping documentation about your previous income and wages is key. This information can be found on your W-2s, paystubs, or invoices if you are a freelancer or independent contractor.

When will the extra $600 show up in my unemployment check?

This will vary state by state, but the extra money should have started to appear in people’s weekly checks — it could longer for those still waiting for their applications to go through. It takes time for the US Department of Labor to coordinate with state unemployment agencies to get the money flowing. While some states have their Pandemic Unemployment Assistance programs up and running, others are still setting their programs up. Depending on what state you live in, it could take longer for freelancers and independent contractors to get their benefit.

“The disaster benefits, they’re going to take a little time to develop the intake,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation.

How much could I get over four months? And what happens if there’s a delay in getting the extra money?

All told, the extra $600 per week will add up to around an extra $10,000 over four months. If there is a delay in it showing up in people’s paychecks (which there likely will be), people will be getting retroactive pay in their first paychecks to make up for the lag time.

“That is a way to get a lot more money to people who really need it,” said Stettner. “It has the ability to prevent some of the real damaging parts of unemployment: reducing your savings, food security, having trouble maintaining your housing.”

What’s the difference between being furloughed and being laid off? Do furloughed employees qualify for the expanded unemployment insurance program?

Unlike a more permanent layoff, a furlough is a temporary period of unemployment — with a promise that the employee will return to work when economic conditions improve. But the big difference here is that while furloughed employees forgo their wages, they keep other benefits like health insurance. Employees who have been furloughed due to coronavirus will be eligible for expanded unemployment insurance.

What’s the process for gig economy workers or independent contractors?

Freelancers, gig economy workers, and independent contractors will file for unemployment insurance from a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which is still being set up by the Labor Department and states and could take longer to be ready in some states (Washington state, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and other states have announced their programs will be ready to take applications by the end of April, while other states like Ohio and Arizona will start accepting applications by mid-May). When the program is available, it can be accessed on state unemployment websites where people apply for regular UI. Check your state’s website for guidance on when and how you should apply, if you fall into this category.

“Gig workers will need to file for PUA first, and then they will get the $600,” said Stettner. “This is the new program part of the law and will take the longest to set up — the pandemic program for gig workers et al.”

What documentation do freelancers or independent contractors who rely on invoices or cash need to prepare to get benefits?

Keeping documentation about your previous income and wages as a freelancer, independent contractor, or self-employed worker is important and will help you when filing for unemployment. Keep documentation both about how you get your money and how much you have been paid per month in the past (old tax returns and invoices are good examples).

“Whatever documentation they have about how they get their money would be helpful,” Evermore added. If people are lacking documentation, they can file good-faith attestations about their wages to unemployment offices, but documents are preferred.

If I’m working two-part time jobs and lose one, can I get benefits for the lost job while still working the other?

Though part-time workers are eligible for expanded benefits, the answer to this question depends on whether the weekly earnings from the second job erase the partial benefit credit you’d get from unemployment, Stettner said.

“In simplest terms, the closer the pay of the second part-time job they have is ... to the first part-time job they lost, the less likely they are to get benefits. The bigger the difference, the more likely to get benefits,” he said.

What if I just got a job offer that is now rescinded or up in the air due to coronavirus?

Again, you are eligible for the expanded unemployment benefits. Having documentation here is also important if you can get it; for instance, having both your offer and a written statement rescinding or postponing that offer that you can send to your state’s unemployment office can be helpful when filing for unemployment.

“However you found your offer was rescinded, keep that handy,” Evermore said.

What if I was unemployed prior to the crisis and am having no luck finding jobs? Can I apply for benefits even if my old benefits ran out?

Yes. Anyone who has exhausted their regular unemployment insurance can get a 13-week extension on their benefits. Once that extension is exhausted, workers can apply for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, Evermore said. “That can go up to 39 weeks total,” she added.

What is the situation for new or soon-to-be college graduates who can’t find a job?

People who are close to graduation and looking for jobs are in more of a bind because of their limited work history.

There’s a provision in a bill from House Democrats that would allow recent college graduates to qualify for something called a “job seekers allowance,” about half of the benefits available for the rest of workers. But unless Congress passes a provision to allow this, recent college graduates are in a tough spot.

What about employees in houses of worship, including ministers, rabbis, or imams?

In many states, congregations don’t pay unemployment insurance and employees aren’t eligible for unemployment. So unless the specific employer has decided to voluntarily participate in unemployment insurance, employees of churches, synagogues or mosques likely won’t be eligible in most states.

However, Stettner and Evermore said it depends on how the US Department of Labor interprets the language of the CARES Act. If the new pandemic program is treated like a standard disaster relief program, church, synagogue, and mosque employees could be covered — but that won’t be determined until Labor provides more information about how the program is being implemented.

"['Umair Irfan', 'Apr']",2020-04-02,Why it can be so hard to tell if you have Covid-19,"Why it can be so hard to tell if you have Covid-19

Share All sharing options for: Why it can be so hard to tell if you have Covid-19

What are the signs you have been infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus? That’s become a surprisingly tricky question to answer, and it’s hampering the fight against the disease.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidelines to include chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, and a new loss of taste or smell as symptoms of Covid-19, in addition to fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Some patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, have experienced symptoms like vomiting and loss of taste and smell. Some people’s Covid-19 symptoms overlap with those of other illnesses like influenza, making these infections hard to distinguish without testing. And some infected patients have reported no symptoms at all.

“As this pandemic unfolds, it’s becoming very clear that the symptoms of Covid vary quite a lot from person to person, and there are a lot of symptoms that we previously didn’t appreciate were related to Covid,” said Andrew Chan, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. “As a result, it’s really put us behind in our ability to identify people with Covid infections, and probably resulted in a lot of people walking around with Covid and not knowing it.”

Related What to do if you have symptoms of the new coronavirus

That has made responding to the crisis all the more frustrating and confusing for health officials, particularly in the United States, where tests for the virus remain scarce. Symptoms are an outward sign of the illness, and in a pinch can serve as a proxy for a test. Many hospitals are already telling patients with Covid-19 symptoms to presume they have the virus and to self-isolate, not even testing to confirm the presence of the virus.

A cluster of symptoms can highlight an emerging hotspot for the virus within a population. But without a clear picture of how Covid-19 manifests, it’s difficult to even approximate the true extent of the pandemic. And without a sense of what to look for, it’s hard for health workers to take proper precautions and offer the right treatments to their patients.

As a result, many communities have been forced to resort to blunt, blanket, and disruptive measures to contain the pandemic, like shelter-in-place orders. Relaxing these restrictions would require a major effort to test the public for the virus, trace movements, and build up health care capacity with beds, ventilators, masks, and workers. Yet there are parts of the US that have yet to impose even these crude measures to limit the spread of Covid-19.

Nonetheless, researchers are coming up with new ways to track the virus, going back to patient records to see what signs are associated with the illness. They’re also asking people to self-report their symptoms and tracking them with a mobile app. They’re finding that some mild, easily brushed-off symptoms could actually be a harbinger of the disease. This knowledge could help slow the pandemic and reveal new approaches to fighting the virus.

Some symptoms of the Covid-19 coronavirus are common, but milder signs are hard to track

Many of the guidelines for Covid-19 symptoms are based on what scientists have learned from past cases, particularly China, where the virus emerged and spread rapidly in January and February. The World Health Organization, for instance, looked at more than 55,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases in China. They found in February that the most common symptoms were fever (87.9 percent of confirmed cases) and dry cough (67.7 percent) — followed by fatigue (38.1 percent), sputum [phlegm] production (33.4 percent), shortness of breath (18.6 percent), sore throat (13.9 percent), and headache (13.6 percent).

But the patients they looked at weren’t necessarily representative of everybody who had the virus there — just the ones who received testing and treatment. In the study, about 80 percent of the patients had mild to moderate disease, 13.8 percent had severe disease, and 6.1 percent were in critical condition.

It’s likely that many infected patients with very minor or no symptoms were not captured by the study, which would mean their symptoms (or lack thereof) were underrepresented in those statistics.

Other studies have shown that symptoms such as gastrointestinal problems could herald the illness. A preliminary non-peer-reviewed study of 204 patients in China found that more than half of them experienced symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Another preliminary study, this time from Germany, found that some Covid-19 patients had symptoms more like that of the common cold, like a runny nose. Researchers in Italy also reported that feelings of discomfort and malaise were associated with Covid-19. And doctors in the US have described neurological symptoms like confusion and seizures in some Covid-19 patients, particularly in the elderly.

These vague and sometimes contradictory symptoms may reflect how the virus interacts with underlying conditions in some patients, like diabetes and high blood pressure, or just differences in susceptibility. This kind of variation is a phenomenon physicians have already seen in other infections.

“For example, for influenza, most people will show up with fevers, body aches, and malaise. But a smaller subset of people will show up with diarrhea and vomiting,” said David Pride, associate director of microbiology at the University of California San Diego, in an email. “What we are experiencing with Covid-19 is probably just mirroring what we see in a number of other illnesses where it affects a subset of people in different ways.”

There’s also a huge range in how severe Covid-19 can be, even within certain subgroups. There are elderly patients who have shrugged off the virus. There are children that have died from it.

Many of these reports of less-common symptoms still need wider validation before they can be used as clinical guidelines. But they illustrate just how confusing it can be for patients and doctors to track Covid-19 without adequate testing.

A smartphone app has uncovered another likely symptom of Covid-19: A loss of taste and smell

Before the CDC’s guidance changed, there were murmurs that anosmia, a loss of the sense of smell, and ageusia, a loss of the sense of taste, could signal a Covid-19 infection. Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert, who tested positive for the virus, said on Twitter that it was one of his most noticeable symptoms. The son of UK sports broadcaster Gary Lineker quaffed vinegar and lemon juice on Instagram to show off his loss of taste after getting Covid-19.

Doctors at the British Rhinological Society said in March they noticed “a rapidly growing number of reports of a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with anosmia in the absence of other symptoms.” Writing in the BMJ, researchers at Newcastle University said, “[T]here is now enough evidence to take this symptom much more seriously.”

Researchers in the United Kingdom recently bolstered that idea with data. Using a Covid symptom tracker app for smartphones launched on March 24, scientists pooled daily reports from more than 1.5 million users of their symptoms or lack thereof. They found that a peculiar loss of taste or smell had strong links to testing positive for Covid-19.

“The strongest association between any of those symptoms and having a positive test was having a loss of smell or taste,” said Tim Spector, a professor of molecular epidemiology at King’s College London and lead researcher in the study.

In the study, 579 app users reported testing positive for Covid-19. And 59 percent of those said they lost their sense of smell or taste. That’s a higher rate than the Covid-19-positive app users reported for fever or any other symptoms.

The likely mechanism here has to do with how the SARS-CoV-2 virus works. Researchers in the US and UK reported in a preliminary study that the virus attacks cells associated with smell in nasal passages, in both mice and humans. That “could lead to anosmia or other forms of olfactory dysfunction,” the researchers wrote.

Spector cautioned that being unable to taste your coffee or smell wildflowers is not a definitive sign of Covid-19. A loss of taste and smell is associated with other upper respiratory tract infections as well as some allergies. In most cases, the loss of these senses isn’t permanent.

That’s why Spector’s team used their app data to build a model of what combination of symptoms was most closely associated with a positive virus test rather than examining any individual symptom.

Using the model, Spector and his team calculated that among the 400,000 app users who self-reported symptoms but did not get a Covid-19 test at all, about 50,000 of them were likely infected with the virus.

“As this pandemic unfolds, it’s becoming very clear that the symptoms of Covid vary quite a lot from person to person”

In places that lack adequate testing, Spector said this kind of symptom tracking could at some point serve as an early warning sign of a rising wave of Covid-19 — and allow potentially infected people to take precautions like self-isolation. And since they found that lost taste and smell can precede other symptoms by weeks, this could give health workers longer lead time to anticipate a spike in hospital visits. “We liken it to a radar,” Spector said.

The research is still in its early stages and may not be suited for making treatment decisions for individual people. But symptoms like anosmia could possibly be added to guidelines that determine who should be tested for Covid-19 or take precautions.

Spector also noted that the data from the app is skewed toward people who say they’re between 20 and 60 years old. Older people who may not typically use smartphones are underrepresented in his data. So are people in rural areas of the UK (the app just launched in the United States this week).

However, as more people sign up for the app, both those who are sick and those who are well, researchers can get a better picture of the pandemic and answer critical questions about the dangers of the virus, who is most at risk, and how best to limit its spread.

Spector is also collaborating with Harvard’s Chan and other researchers on the symptom-tracking app. Chan said that one of the key benefits of widespread symptom tracking is not necessarily finding the specific symptoms but being able to identify a sudden spike in symptoms, whatever they may be.

“If it’s just one person that feels this way, we don’t know what to make of that,” he said. “But if many people are feeling the same way with subtle symptoms then that is something that’s really worth sitting up and taking notice about.”

People transmitting Covid-19 before they have symptoms is a huge public health threat

Another complicating factor about Covid-19 is that people can spread the virus before they have symptoms, which can take up to two weeks to appear. And so people can transmit the disease to others unknowingly. Some virus spreaders may not ever feel sick throughout their entire infection.

According to the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from April 1, 2020, asymptomatic transmission “increases the challenges of COVID-19 containment measures.” Tactics like self-isolation or quarantines depend on early detection of potential infections, so without outward signs of illness, they become much less effective at slowing the disease.

It’s also still not clear just how many people are out there spreading the virus without noticeable symptoms. Chan said that it may be the case that many purported asymptomatic transmitters do actually have some symptoms but that they’re so mild that the infected don’t connect the dots between their experiences and Covid-19.

“There probably are some people who are truly asymptomatic, meaning they have the infection but feel perfectly well,” Chan said. “But there are probably people who have much more subtle symptoms or they may just assume that it’s related to something else.”

To find the people transmitting the virus without symptoms, researchers need widespread testing to confirm cases of Covid-19. Beyond the current genetic test that identifies active infections, scientists are also looking at serological testing, which can reveal who was previously infected with the virus (and may now have immunity to it). That information can help scientists see if patients overlooked any other potential signs of infection.

However, this would require public health officials to test more than the critically ill or health workers on the front lines; they will need far more widespread testing of the population at large to truly start to gain ground against the Covid-19 pandemic.

In addition to testing, safely lifting pandemic control measures like social distancing would require a massive coordinated effort to train health workers, to gather data, to trace contacts with the virus, and to manufacture all the equipment necessary. It would also require the public to remain vigilant about adhering to social distancing guidelines until then and to maintain good hygiene through tactics like proper handwashing.

But right now, the US is still struggling with widespread testing shortages. There are not enough testing kits to go around, as well as dwindling supplies of masks, gowns, and other personal protective equipment for workers collecting samples, as well as doctors and nurses.

That means health officials still have to make tough decisions about who to test, and they will likely remain in the dark about the true scope of the pandemic as cases and deaths continue to mount.",vox,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/2/21200217/coronavirus-symptoms-covid-19-fever-cough-smell-taste
"['Umair Irfan', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-03-03,What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?,"Update, April 29: The CDC has updated its guidelines to include chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, and a new loss of taste or smell as symptoms of Covid-19, in addition to fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

So you’re not feeling well, and you’re afraid you might be infected with the new coronavirus disease, Covid-19. Given that the United States now has more confirmed cases than any other country, and more are popping up, that might be a reasonable suspicion.

Health officials are ramping up the response measures, advising people to stay at home as much as possible. Several states and cities have now imposed more severe measures like lockdowns and stay-at-home-orders to contain the virus.

But cases of Covid-19 are following an exponential growth trajectory in the US. That means that the number of infections is rising rapidly in proportion to the number of people infected. You may have been exposed if you have traveled to a region with novel coronavirus transmission or if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has Covid-19, something that’s becoming harder to avoid without social distancing. And some people spreading the virus may not show any symptoms at all.

Here are some signs you may have the illness:

The World Health Organization, based on its research in China, reports the illness can present in different ways, ranging from no symptoms at all to severe pneumonia.

Some symptoms are more frequently seen than others. Based on confirmed cases in China, the WHO says 88 percent of infected people experienced a fever and 67.7 percent had a dry cough. Less frequent symptoms include thick mucus from coughs (sputum) (33.4 percent), shortness of breath (18.6 percent), sore throat (13.9 percent), and headache (13.6 percent).

It’s likely, however, that many infected patients with very minor or no symptoms were not captured by this study, which would mean their symptoms (or lack thereof) were underrepresented in those statistics.

“Covid-19 disease usually begins with mild fever, dry cough, sore throat and malaise,” writes Megan Murray, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard Medical School, in an FAQ for the Abundance Foundation. “Unlike the coronavirus infections that cause the common cold, it is not usually associated with a runny nose.”

These symptoms emerge five or six days after infection on average, but can show up in as little as a day or as much as two weeks after exposure.

Doctors and researchers have also found some other symptoms associated with Covid-19, though they haven’t been recognized as diagnostic criteria by the WHO or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A recent, yet-to-be-published German study found that some Covid-19 patients can present with the symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, similar to the common cold: runny nose, congestion, and sneezing. (The study involved a very small number of patients, however.)

In a study of 204 Covid-19 patients, researchers in China found that half of patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology reported that Covid-19 can present as conjunctivitis, causing red or pink, itchy eyes.

Using a Covid symptom tracker app for smartphones, researchers in the United Kingdom recently found that a peculiar loss of taste or smell had strong links to testing positive for Covid-19. Some researchers now say that anosmia, a loss of the sense of smell, and ageusia, a loss of the sense of taste, should be considered Covid-19 symptoms. These symptoms can precede others by several days so they can be an early warning sign of infection.

If you have symptoms, what should you do?

The CDC advises people to seek medical attention immediately if they have trouble breathing or emergency warning signs like persistent chest pain, confusion, and bluish lips.

People with symptoms in one of the high-risk groups — those who are over 65 years old; people with diabetes, hypertension, or preexisting breathing problems; or people being treated for cancer — should quickly seek medical advice or treatment. Call your health care provider before heading to a clinic if you suspect you may have Covid-19. That way, the clinic can take appropriate precautions for your visit.

If you’re not in a high-risk group and have symptoms, mild or severe, you should also call a health professional — a doctor, a nurse, or a public health official. They will work with your local health department and figure out whether you need to get tested or get treatment. And make no mistake: While older people face the highest risks, all age groups can get sick from Covid-19, so everyone needs to take precautions and pay attention to their symptoms.

Doctors and health officials advise not to go to the emergency room if your symptoms do not appear to be life-threatening.

Also, don’t panic. Most people who get infected get better, often on their own with just rest, fluids, and fever medication. If you are advised to stay home, there are several other measures you should take, according to the CDC.

The most important step is to avoid exposing other people to the illness, especially in the early stages of symptoms, when the disease is most contagious. That means staying home from school or work, avoiding public transit or ride-hail services, and separating yourself from the people and animals in your home. It also means avoiding sharing household items like towels, dishes, and bedding.

Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue over your mouth and nose. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Clean the surfaces in your home that you come into contact with regularly, like counters, doorknobs, bedside tables, keyboards, and phones. “It is possible that some of the viral particles ... end up on surfaces (door handles, subway poles, coins) where they might remain viable,” Murray writes.

When leaving your home, wear a surgical face mask if possible to avoid spreading the virus if you’re sick. Officials are urging the public not to buy N95 masks because they are needed by health workers and are in short supply. But other face coverings can be used, and the CDC has recommended cloth masks for everyone in certain public settings.

All the while, pay close attention to your symptoms. Call your health care provider if your symptoms get worse. If you have a health emergency and need to call 911, let the dispatcher know that you may have Covid-19 so responders can prepare.

And everyone, with or without symptoms, should observe social distancing guidelines. That’s because infected people can spread the virus to others, even without experiencing symptoms themselves.

These steps may seem tedious, but remember that they serve to protect not just you but also the people around you. Controlling an outbreak is everyone’s job.

"['Dylan Scott', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Why the coronavirus may be killing more Americans than the government data says,"Evidence-based explanations of the coronavirus crisis, from how it started to how it might end to how to protect yourself and others.

It’s long been the consensus of experts that more Americans are dying in the coronavirus pandemic than the official figures indicate. But exactly how many?

This week, the first estimate of how many more people have perished was published in the Washington Post, using one of the best methods commonly used by researchers: measuring excess deaths.

And it was a grim one. The Post, in partnership with researchers from the Yale School of Public Health, estimated that 15,400 more people died between March 1 and April 4 than would ordinarily have been expected, a substantially higher toll than the 8,128 coronavirus deaths that were reported over that time by government agencies. Ordinarily, the researchers project the US would have had a little more than 50,000 deaths in the studied period, but the actual deaths were more than 60,000.

Not all of those excess deaths were necessarily directly a result of Covid-19. As the Post reporters wrote, mortality in a pandemic is a complicated recipe:

The excess deaths are not necessarily attributable directly to covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. They could include people who died because of the epidemic but not from the disease, such as those who were afraid to seek medical treatment for unrelated illnesses, as well as some number of deaths that are part of the ordinary variation in the death rate. The count is also affected by increases or decreases in other categories of deaths, such as suicides, homicides and motor vehicle accidents. But in any pandemic, higher-than-normal mortality is a starting point for scientists seeking to understand the full impact of the disease.

“Determining the cause of death is more of an art than a science, and guidelines can change,” Daniel Weinberger, who led the Yale School of Public Health researchers, told me. “There are likely many more people who died of coronavirus-related causes than who have ‘coronavirus’ listed as a cause of death on the death certificate.”

Then again, you also have to account for how many of the people who died from Covid-19 might have died anyway, given poor health, as well as the lives saved because, for example, fewer people are driving automobiles during a period of nationwide lockdowns.

“One way to avoid these biases is to look at what happens to rates of death due to any cause,” Weinberger said. His team created a regression model that adjusts for the seasonal variations in mortality and changes in mortality over time. They accounted for flu activity as well.

The bottom line, according to Weinberger: “With all those complexities, we still see that there were about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. This is about 1.5 to 2 times higher than the reported number of Covid-19 deaths at the time.”

And if anything, that is probably the floor. Experts including Weinberger agree the death counts are likely to be revised upward as more reporting come in. Tallying deaths always takes time because of inconsistent reporting across states.

“As we gain more detailed information on the causes of death, we will learn more about whether Covid-19 caused them directly, or whether the many disruptions, both to health care, and economic disruption, could have caused many of the excess deaths,” Ellen Meara, a health economics professor at Harvard, told me over email. “What is remarkable to me about the sheer number of excess deaths is that this spike in deaths has occurred despite some trends that we expect to lower deaths during Covid-19.”

More people are dying from Covid-19 than the official count says

More than 58,000 Americans are confirmed to have died from the coronavirus as of midday on April 29. As the Yale study suggests, that number is likely low.

In some respects, it is no mystery why more people have died during the coronavirus pandemic than the government figures indicate. The officially reported number of Covid-19 deaths generally comes from hospitals. People who die at home may not be counted if they are never tested for the coronavirus. Instead, they may have a pulmonary embolism or heart attack listed as their cause of death, even if Covid-19 was the catalyst for their passing.

“People who die at home are least likely to be counted, particularly since we are seeing some people dying of pulmonary embolism or other clotting,” Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida, said.

“It would be hard to identify COVID-19 as the cause of the death there unless they are doing postmortem testing,” she said. “I assume there is more postmortem testing now than there was earlier, but when tests were in really short supply, I have to imagine postmortem testing was very rare.”

New York City has already revised its death count upward to account for nearly 4,000 people assumed to have died of Covid-19 but who were never tested for it. The city is now up to 17,700 reported deaths, as of April 29. Future official revisions may be made, but this is one advantage of the approach taken by Weinberger and company: it simply counts how many people are dying overall, of any cause, and compares it to a hypothetical reality with no Covid-19.

Undercounting coronavirus deaths isn’t only an American problem. The Financial Times analyzed data from 14 countries and found 122,000 excess deaths above what would be expected. Spain has seen 27,600 more deaths than usual in March and April; Italy is up to 21,500, and France 16,500. A separate FT analysis of England and Wales estimated that Covid-19 is killing twice as many people as the government has attributed to the crisis.

And these numbers are really a baseline. “Revisions AAAAALLLLLWAAAAAAAYS go up,” Lyman Stone, an economist and adjunct fellow with the American Enterprise Institute who has studied mortality rates, told me over email.

Using a methodology to account for expected revisions, he is preliminarily projecting that excess deaths could exceed 60,000 or more in March and April.

I didn't want to be the first one to publish a US excess death number because I thought it was reckless at this point but



hey since we're doin' it



here's a better estimate than what's shown there pic.twitter.com/nCo6NW7F1v — Lyman Expand the House Stone, AKA 石來民 (@lymanstoneky) April 27, 2020

You get the point. The coronavirus’s toll is likely worse than we know right now. The big question is why.

There are other reasons people might be dying more — or less — during Covid-19

In all likelihood, some of the 15,400 excess deaths measured in the Yale study were not the direct result of Covid-19. So why else are so many more people dying in a pandemic?

One of the most obvious candidates is the strain on the American health system from coronavirus, which is leading people to die from causes they might otherwise not have — think of a mild heart attack or a complication if somebody with a chronic condition runs short on medicine and can’t see their doctor to get a prescription filled. This was a fear from the start, as medical facilities revamped their operations to focus on Covid-19, and emergency responders were inundated with a record number of calls.

“It‘s possible that emergency response teams, hospitals, and nursing home facilities overburdened with coronavirus have been unable to effectively prevent deaths from other causes they would ordinarily have been able to,” Jessica Ho, a USC sociologist who studies mortality, said.

The interruptions to routine care for people with chronic conditions could also be to blame, with primary care practices postponing many outpatient services and furloughing staff. As I wrote recently on the dramatic downturn in primary care visits during the outbreak:

“Within my lifetime, I have not seen anything of this magnitude,” Ateev Mehrotra, a professor at Harvard Medical School who led the study, told me. He also said that “our real concern is those patients who might have deferred a visit and they’re going to have a flare-up of their chronic illness.” In a worst-case scenario, that could lead to patients dying at home — a person with heart failure, for example — who might not have if they’d been able to see their regular doctor. This will add to the death toll of Covid-19, but it will be hard to fully measure.

Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown’s Health Policy Institute and a chronic care patient herself, worried about people recently diagnosed with diabetes or heart disease who won’t be able to get that critical first appointment with a new doctor. “You can’t delay those appointments for a few months.”

The mental health toll of the current economic crisis caused by the coronavirus and accompanying lockdowns could also be driving up deaths, several experts told me. (There are indications domestic violence is increasing during the pandemic, though it’s not clear if that is translating to a rise in deaths.)

“We know that reported levels of anxiety and depression are rising, and claims for unemployment insurance are at historic highs,” Meara said. “All of these could contribute to increased death from suicide, as prior economic downturns suggest.”

On the other hand, other causes of deaths might be down because of the pandemic and stay-at-home orders. Car accidents are one obvious candidate. Pollution is down, and that could be a boon for health. Some people with physically demanding jobs are working less, which could also be resulting in fewer deaths than would otherwise occur.

Throw all these ingredients together — uncounted Covid-19 deaths, other preventable deaths from a health system overload, the health toll of record unemployment, and then saved lives because people are driving less and other behavioral changes — and you get a fuller picture of the coronavirus’s toll. The Yale researchers provided a preliminary figure; Stone’s personal estimates anticipate excess deaths will continue to mount.

This data is a reminder that a pandemic can take a toll beyond the damage caused by the pathogen itself. But first and foremost, when excess deaths are twice as high as the official coronavirus death toll, it’s a clear indication that we are not doing a good job of counting all the deaths that are the direct result of this virus.

As Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me: “In all likelihood, many of these excess deaths can likely be attributed to Covid.”

"['Emily Stewart', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Why the US shouldn’t let states go bankrupt,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s suggestion that maybe states and cities should just go bankrupt amid the coronavirus-induced economic crisis they’re facing has not been particularly well-received. A big part of the issue: As the law stands right now, states can’t declare bankruptcy.

But the controversy points to a broader problem states across the country are facing — their costs have skyrocketed and their revenue has plummeted, and unlike the federal government, they can’t run a deficit. They’ve got to balance their budgets so that they take in what they put out. And right now, a lot of states are sounding the alarm that they’re going to need to make deep spending cuts unless the federal government steps in.

New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, for example, warned his state could need to make $500 million in cuts next year. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson estimated he’ll have to cut $700 million and has already put a pause in $227 million in state funding. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has said he plans to furlough thousands of city workers.

The problem — at least with most states and cities — isn’t that they’ve managed their finances particularly poorly. It’s that they’re in the midst of an unprecedented crisis.

“States have balanced budget rules to keep them from doing things that are fiscally imprudent. In practice, when we’ve hit recessions that’s led to difficulty,” explained Kim Rueben, director of the state and local finance initiative at the left-leaning Urban Institute. States are able to raise more tax money when the economy is doing well, not when it’s doing poorly, even though that’s often the time when it needs money for things like unemployment and health care most. Many states have rainy day funds to cover downturns — the 50-state total recently hit $75 billion.

“Not all of the states were good, but on average, they had actually put money away to try and handle what is your normal economic cycle,” Rueben said. “What we are entering into right now is not normal in any way, shape, or form.”

No, it’s not a good idea for states to declare bankruptcy

States and cities are coming under an enormous amount of financial pressure amid the coronavirus crisis, and while the federal government has provided some relief, many leaders and lawmakers are calling for it to do more in follow-up legislation after the $2.2 trillion stimulus package signed into law in late March. And last week, McConnell offered an alternative to support: Perhaps states should just declare bankruptcy.

“I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there’s no good reason for it not to be available,” he said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don’t have to do that. That’s not something I’m going to be in favor of.”

The reaction to his comments was swift. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called McConnell’s remarks one of the “saddest, really dumb comments of all time” and emphasized the dark message this would send to the markets and to the world about the state of the American economy. “You want to send a signal to the markets that this nation is in real trouble? You want to send an international message the economy is in trouble? Do that,” he said.

But under federal law, states can’t declare bankruptcy. So McConnell would have to change the law. Municipalities have been allowed to declare bankruptcy since 1937, but the only option for states is just to not pay their debts. Jim Saska at Roll Call explained:

In casual conversation, “bankrupt” and “broke” may be interchangeable terms. But bankruptcy is a legal process in which a person, company or municipality reorganizes its debts. It happens when an entity is insolvent — when there isn’t enough money to pay everyone what they’re owed. Companies also have the added option of shutting down and selling assets to pay off as much of the debt as possible. One reason for bankruptcy to be unavailable to states is that they have the ability to raise taxes, and thus get the money to pay their debts. State bankruptcy thus risks being used for political purposes.

States defaulting on their debts is rare — the last time it happened was Arkansas in 1933 during the Great Depression.

McConnell has suggested that federal money to the states right now would be used to “bail out state pensions.” And while pension funds are indeed a chronic challenge in some states, that’s not what’s going on right now. What’s happening right now is we’re in a pandemic.

“Trying to blame the current need for federal assistance on things like public pensions seems dishonest to me and is sort of laying the blame of where are right now at the feet of the wrong culprit. There are long-term issues that states are going to have to deal with, but now is not necessarily the time to do it,” Rueben said. “We need to put out the fire before we rebuild the house.”

To be sure, McConnell’s suggestion that states go bankrupt could be more of a political play than an actual policy proposal. The Kentucky Republican has begun to talk about wanting to avoid a “blue state bailout” and cast this as a Democratic state issue. As Vox’s Dylan Matthew notes, he has also seemingly rediscovered he’s worried about the deficit. And it’s not just McConnell who is using city and state aid as a bargaining chip — President Donald Trump wants to use it as leverage to get cities and states to change their immigration policies.

But balanced budget amendments are a thing

While the state bankruptcy conversation isn’t great, a conversation about what balanced budgets require could be helpful.

To back up a bit, the first state to put in place a balanced budget amendment in its constitution was Rhode Island in 1842, and other states followed. As of 2015, 46 states plus Washington, DC, have some sort of balanced budget requirement, which basically means they can only spend as much revenue as they’re bringing in. How stringent these requirements are varies by state; some experts say the only state that doesn’t have to balance its budget is Vermont, as Matthews explained:

Virginia doesn’t require the legislature or governor to pass or sign a balanced budget, for example, but bans deficit carryover, which de facto requires a balanced budget. Arizona and Indiana ban taking out debt altogether, also de facto requiring a balanced budget. Colorado and Nebraska also ban taking out debt, and at least 12 other states require voter approval of new debt, greatly limiting legislatures’ ability to borrow.

The concept at the core of balanced budget amendments is generally a sound one — you don’t want to be dealing with 50 states in varying levels of financial distress and health. But they become an issue in times of crisis.

“In order to effectively manage our finances, we need both to have our expenditures lining up with our revenues, as a country, but we also need to have the ability to spend more than we’re taking in a year because there are certain times when ... if you don’t deal with the immediate crisis, a recession is going to get worse,” said Michael Leachman, director of state fiscal research at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).

He added, “We need the fed government to be able to have the capacity to do that. But at the state level, we don’t need states to also have that capacity, and having states be required to have balanced budgets, it assures that their finances are in order.”

States can’t print money, but the federal government can.

The options states are left with: They can cut their spending, or they can increase revenue, or do some combination of those things. The problem right now is that the ways states usually generate revenue — sales and income taxes — have fallen off of a cliff, and spending on responding to the crisis in areas such as health care and unemployment has skyrocketed.

And so states wind up making cuts where they can: They lay off and furlough public employees, meaning teachers, police officers, and firefighters; they make cuts to K-12 and higher education; and they scale back infrastructure spending, among other mechanisms. That creates an even bigger drag on the economy, making the downturn worse and the recovery slower.

“It’s the worst possible time for that to be happening, to have another round of layoffs. It’s just going to make the recession worse, and that’s why it’s so crucial for the federal government to step in,” Leachman said.

States do have some budgeting maneuvers to try to push certain expenses into different fiscal years (most state budgets run on fiscal years from July 1 to June 30), explained Josh Goodman, state economic development officer at Pew Charitable Trusts. So, for example, a payment to a school district slated for late June can be made in the first week of July.

“There are things like that that states can do — that budget is still balanced on paper,” Goodman said. “In thinking about balanced budget requirements, it’s important to acknowledge that they have a very real impact on how states make budget decisions, especially compared to the federal government, but they aren’t these ironclad limitations, at least in most states.”

This is why the federal government needs to do more

States and cities, whether they are blue or red, translate to businesses and to people. And state and local governments can only do so much to keep their finances in check right now. The more cuts they make, the worse the economic downturn becomes, and the longer the recovery will take as well. California and Alabama, New York and Iowa, they’re all America.

As I recently explained, Congress and the Federal Reserve have provided some assistance, but it is going to need to do more if it doesn’t want to make the US economy — and many people’s lives — worse:

The $2.2 trillion CARES Act provides $150 billion to state, tribal, and local governments. The package also includes $30 billion for education, $25 billion for mass transit systems, $5 billion for community development block grants, $3.5 billion for child care, and $400 million for elections. And it has the Paycheck Protection Program, the $349 billion loan program to small businesses meant to support them and keep their workers employed. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, temporarily increases federal funding for Medicaid.

The United States has a system where many of the country’s priorities are handled at the state and local level — the local school systems, colleges and universities, infrastructure, prisons and jails, the health care systems. The federal government is supposed to work in partnership with states and cities by design, the idea being that they’re closer to the ground on understanding the needs and wants of their citizens.

“You want the financing of them to be solid,” Leachman said. “It’s in the national interest to make sure that that happens, and it’s another reason why it should be a no-brainer for the federal government to provide the fiscal relief that states and localities need right now.”

"['Eliza Barclay', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,Why these scientists still doubt the coronavirus leaked from a Chinese lab,"One of the great mysteries of the Covid-19 pandemic is how, exactly, the SARS-CoV-2 virus made the leap from wildlife into humans. Scientists who’ve analyzed the virus’s genome believe it came from a bat, likely in China. But Chinese epidemiologists have revealed little about how or where the first patients were infected.

One focus has been a wet market in Wuhan, where live wildlife was sold for food, because 66 percent of the first cluster of 41 cases in December 2019 had exposure to this market. Yet there is also genomic evidence and reports the virus could have been circulating earlier, in November. Which means there are many other possible places it could have jumped from a bat, or an intermediary species, to humans.

Finding the index case, or “patient zero,” for an infectious disease that’s just emerged can take months or years, if the person can even be found at all. So it’s not unusual we still don’t have one, especially for a disease with so much asymptomatic transmission.

Into the vacuum has seeped a potent, speculative, and confusing discussion about the virus’s origin, particularly in the US, where the GOP is intensifying its efforts to blame China for the pandemic.

In March, I offered explanations from virus experts for why they dismiss two of the theories that have surfaced about the coronavirus origin: that Chinese scientists bioengineered it in a lab and/or deployed it as a bioweapon.

In this piece, I’ll address the theory du jour: that a Chinese researcher was infected with the new virus inside a high-containment Wuhan laboratory and accidentally spread it, after which China attempted to cover it up.

This hypothesis has been circulating in US, UK, and Chinese media since February, with fresh reporting and speculation this month in the Daily Mail, Vanity Fair, Fox News, and the Washington Post. A Tuesday op-ed drawing solely from circumstantial evidence by chief “labber” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) in the Wall Street Journal raised the question anew.

Riding the wave of these reports, President Donald Trump is also now using this potential avenue for blaming China; on April 15, he said his government was looking into whether the virus came from the Wuhan lab. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also said Beijing “needs to come clean” on what it knows about the virus’s origin.

Trump and the GOP’s motivation to establish new ways to blame China for the pandemic is clear: The president’s response to the pandemic has been abominable, and he faces an election in six months, with more than 22 million people unemployed and an economy heading toward recession. The lab-escape theory joins a variety of arguments he and his supporters are using — including scapegoating the World Health Organization and former President Barack Obama — to divert attention from his failures.

The Wuhan lab may also be the most tantalizing of the diversions, not just for Trump’s supporters but also for some political journalists and China hawks. What if the catastrophe is a result not of nature but of China’s incompetence with handling viruses and habit for suppressing information?

Such a spy-novel-worthy plot may seem plausible for a number of reasons: the Chinese government’s poor record of transparency; the fact that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a research center with facilities in the same city where the virus first appeared, was studying dangerous pathogens, including bat coronaviruses; and US officials’ concerns about the lab’s safety standards in 2018, per the Washington Post.

Yet five scientists I interviewed, some of whom have worked extensively in China with researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, say the pandemic can’t logically be pinned on an accident at that lab. (Researchers at the institute didn’t respond to my request for comment.)

The scientists I did speak to all acknowledge it’s not possible to definitively rule out the lab-escape theory. “The trouble with hypotheses is that they are not disprovable. You cannot prove a negative,” said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance and a disease ecologist who has studied emerging infectious diseases with colleagues in China. Yet he also sees the lab-escape theory as “ironic and preposterous.”

The scientists I spoke to also noted that all countries with high-level containment facilities, including China and the US, must be vigilant to prevent accidental leaks of dangerous diseases from labs. “I think we all are concerned about the increasing presence of high-consequence pathogens in laboratories and the issue of inadequate biosecurity,” said Dennis Carroll, the former director of USAID’s emerging threats division who helped design Predict, a surveillance program for dangerous animal viruses that the Trump administration chose to shut down in October. “We’ve seen examples of inadvertent release in the past and I’m sure we will see it in the future. So it’s a very major concern that we need to pay attention to.”

But scientists told me that based on what they know about the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the likelihood of a natural spillover event, they didn’t see lab escape as probable. And one expert added that it could be dangerous to get too preoccupied with this theory when the threat of another disease with pandemic potential from wildlife is so high.

Since politics will continue to propel this theory into the public sphere, let’s walk through six reasons a lab leak is unlikely.

1) The probability of the virus jumping from animals to humans outside the lab is much higher than the virus infecting humans inside the lab

Daszak is a scientist who has spent the past 15 years collaborating with scientists in China and other emerging disease hot spots around the world to find out where dangerous viruses lurking in wildlife — like the first SARS virus, MERS, and Ebola — are, how they get into people, and how to stop people from spreading them and spiraling into pandemics.

He says he’s confident SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus, originated in bats and jumped into people somewhere, likely in China, because he and his colleagues have established that viruses like it are out there and there are so many opportunities for this to happen.

“If you do the math on this, it’s very straightforward. ... We have hundreds of millions of bats in Southeast Asia and about 10 percent of bats in some colonies have viruses at any one time. So that’s hundreds of thousands of bats every night with viruses,” Daszak says. “We also find tens of thousands of people in the wildlife trade, hunting and killing wildlife in China and Southeast Asia, and millions of people living in rural populations in Southeast Asia near bat caves.”

Next, he says, consider the data he’s collected on people near bat caves getting exposed to viruses: “We went out and surveyed a population in Yunnan, China — we’d been to bat caves and found viruses that we thought could be high risk. So we sample people nearby, and 3 percent had antibodies to those viruses,” he says. “So between the last two and three years, those people were exposed to bat coronaviruses. If you extrapolate that population across the whole of Southeast Asia, it’s 1 million to 7 million people a year getting infected by bat viruses.”

Compare that, he says, to what we know about the labs: “If you look at the labs in Southeast Asia that have any coronaviruses in culture, there are probably two or three and they’re in high security. The Wuhan Institute of Virology does have a small number of bat coronaviruses in culture. But they’re not [the new coronavirus], SARS-CoV-2. There are probably half a dozen people that do work in those labs. So let’s compare 1 million to 7 million people a year to half a dozen people; it’s just not logical.”

But he told me he gets why people in the US, who aren’t regularly exposed to bats, have a hard time understanding how great the risk is of humans getting infected with novel coronaviruses circulating in bats.

“I understand — it’s a weird thing. Bats live out there, we don’t see them that often, we don’t realize how common, how abundant, how diverse they are,” he says. “In Southeast Asia, they carry their own viruses, and there’s just this really big interface between bats and people, every night, every day. People live in caves, people shelter from the rain in caves, people hunt bats.”

Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, also sees the lab-leak theory as very unlikely. “This virus came from bats under unknown circumstances,” she told me. “While I cannot rule out the lab-accident theory, there are so many other possibilities for how it could have happened. It could have been someone collecting bat guano for fertilizer, somebody cleaning out a barn, somebody exploring a cave. It could be any situation like that of someone in contact with animals who then spread it to other humans. There are so many other options than a lab leak.”

2) Yes, the Wuhan lab studied bat coronaviruses and SARS-related viruses. But there’s no evidence it discovered or was working on the new virus.

One of the big arguments “labber” theorists make for why we should suspect the Wuhan Institute of Virology of accidentally leaking the virus: Researchers there were already studying bat coronaviruses.

This is true; they published studies on the first SARS coronavirus that infected humans in 2003 and other bat coronaviruses, noting presciently in one paper, “it is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China.”

In 2020, they reported on a virus called RaTG13 that they’d discovered in a cave in Yunnan, China, in 2013. This virus shares 96 percent of its genome with the new coronavirus, which makes it the new virus’s closest known relative.

Some have speculated that perhaps the new coronavirus is derived from RaTG13. Yet virologists say it’s very unlikely: A 4 percent difference in genome is actually huge in evolutionary terms.

“The level of genome sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is equivalent to an average of 50 years (and at least 20 years) of evolutionary change,” said Edward Holmes, a professor at the University of Sydney who has published six academic papers this year on the genome and origin of SARS-CoV-2, in a statement. “Hence, SARS-CoV-2 was not derived from RaTG13.”

Another questionable assumption is that the mere existence of a related virus in the lab signals the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was also there.

Daszak, who collaborates with the Wuhan bat coronavirus researchers and has co-authored papers with them, says this is false. He and the researchers there were indeed looking for viruses related to the first SARS virus, also known as SARS-1, in the hope of finding ones that might be a threat to humans. He confirmed that they had collected samples of bat feces that contained viruses and brought them back to the Wuhan lab.

However, he said, the new coronavirus is only 80 percent similar to SARS-1 — again, a very big difference. “No one [in Wuhan] cultured viruses from those samples that were 20 percent different, i.e., no one had SARS-CoV-2 in culture. All of the hypotheses [of lab release] depend on them having it in culture or bats in a lab. No one’s got bats in a lab, it’s absolutely unnecessary and very difficult to do.” (Cell culture is a way of storing viruses in vitro in a lab so they can be studied over long periods.)

3) Scientists like to gossip about new viruses. There was no chatter before the outbreak about the virus that causes Covid-19.

Carroll, the former director of USAID’s emerging threats division who also spent years working with emerging infectious disease scientists in China, agrees that there’s no evidence the Chinese researchers were working with a novel pathogen. His reasoning? He would have heard about it.

“The reason I’m not putting a lot of weight on [the lab-escape theory] is there was no chatter prior to the emergence of this virus to a discovery that would have ended up bringing the virus into a lab,” he says. “And if nothing else, the scientific community tends to be very gossipy. If there is a novel, potentially dangerous virus which has been identified, circulating in nature, and it’s brought into a laboratory, there is chatter about that. And when you look back retrospectively, there’s no chatter whatsoever about the discovery of a new virus.”

“If nothing else, the scientific community tends to be very gossipy”

Carroll is confident he would have heard about it because, in his current role as head of the Global Virome Project, he has his ear to the ground and remains active in the community.

When I asked if the Chinese researchers would have kept it secret, he replied, “People will come back and say China is China, they would have suppressed that information. But Chinese scientists, I think, are just as gregarious as everyone else.”

Rasmussen, for her part, also thinks there’s no suggestion of a cover-up. “I haven’t seen evidence of a grand conspiracy to cover up that there was a lab leak of this virus,” she said.

4) The US military chief reviewed the evidence and says “the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural” origin

As the lab-escape theory has gotten more attention in the media, we’ve learned that US military and intelligence officials have also been reviewing the possibility.

On April 14, we got a window into what those ongoing investigations have revealed so far about whether the virus leaked from a lab or jumped to people outside a lab, in nature.

“There’s a lot of rumor and speculation in a wide variety of media, blog sites, etc,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told reporters at the Pentagon. “It should be no surprise to you that we’ve taken a keen interest in that, and we’ve had a lot of intelligence look at that. And I would just say at this point, it’s inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural [origin]. But we don’t know for certain.”

Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the Joint Staff surgeon, has also said “there is nothing to” the idea that the virus originated in a laboratory as a bioweapon experiment.

What’s more, as the New York Times reported in its sweeping April 11 review of the administration’s failed coronavirus response, intelligence officials couldn’t find evidence for the lab theory after Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser who was one of the earliest advocates for Trump to refer to Covid-19 as the “Wuhan virus,” pushed them to look for it:

With his skeptical — some might even say conspiratorial — view of China’s ruling Communist Party, Mr. Pottinger initially suspected that President Xi Jinping’s government was keeping a dark secret: that the virus may have originated in one of the laboratories in Wuhan studying deadly pathogens. In his view, it might have even been a deadly accident unleashed on an unsuspecting Chinese population. During meetings and telephone calls, Mr. Pottinger asked intelligence agencies — including officers at the C.I.A. working on Asia and on weapons of mass destruction — to search for evidence that might bolster his theory. They didn’t have any evidence. Intelligence agencies did not detect any alarm inside the Chinese government that analysts presumed would accompany the accidental leak of a deadly virus from a government laboratory.

Newsweek reported April 27 that in March the US Defense Intelligence Agency issued a report that “reveals that U.S. intelligence revised its January assessment in which it ‘judged that the outbreak probably occurred naturally’ to now include the possibility that the new coronavirus emerged ‘accidentally’ due to ‘unsafe laboratory practices’ in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.”

Again, the US government’s investigation into the theory is ongoing, so it’s possible it will turn up new information. But so far, the reports we do have suggest the natural origin is more likely.

5) Wuhan Institute of Virology scientists deny a lab leak

There’s no question the Chinese government and ruling party made grave errors in managing the outbreak from the outset that contributed to its spread around the world. And according to Nature, the government is putting in place new rules in reviewing research on the virus origin.

As Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) put it to my colleague Alex Ward, “We don’t know the true extent of the Chinese government’s complicity in the spread of the virus, and we may never have a full picture due to their obfuscation and control of information. We do know that they lied to their own people and the world about the details and spread of the virus, and today we face a pandemic that has left no country untouched.”

Related 12 experts on how the US should hold China accountable for the coronavirus

And China should, as the Washington Post’s David Ignatius pointed out on April 23, “promptly begin a serious, credible investigation into how the Covid-19 pandemic began.”

But the scientists I interviewed say that we still shouldn’t immediately conflate the work of the highly regarded Chinese scientists who work at the lab with the transgressions of their government.

We also have the word of one of the top virologists at the Wuhan lab, documented in news articles, that she too wondered if the virus could have originated in her lab and then took steps to verify it didn’t match any of the viruses they had in culture.

In this excellent article by Jane Qiu in Scientific American, we learned that the team at the Wuhan lab led by Shi Zhengli, known as China’s “bat woman” for her 16 years of work collecting samples of bat viruses in caves, sequenced the genome of the new virus in early January and published it on January 23:

Shi instructed her team to repeat the tests and, at the same time, sent the samples to another laboratory to sequence the full viral genomes. Meanwhile she frantically went through her own laboratory’s records from the past few years to check for any mishandling of experimental materials, especially during disposal. Shi breathed a sigh of relief when the results came back: none of the sequences matched those of the viruses her team had sampled from bat caves. “That really took a load off my mind,” she says. “I had not slept a wink for days.”

Yuan Zhiming, vice director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, also recently spoke up on Chinese state broadcaster CGTN. “As people who carry out viral study, we clearly know what kind of research is going on in the institute and how the institute manages viruses and samples. As we said early on, there is no way this virus came from us,” he said, according to NBC News.

I asked Jim LeDuc, head of the Galveston National Laboratory, a level-4 biosafety lab in Texas, for his thoughts on Yuan’s statement. “I like to think that we can take Zhiming Yuan at his word, but he works in a very different culture with pressures we may not fully appreciate,” he said. In other words, we don’t know what kind of pressures he might be under from his government to make such a statement.

LeDuc says the hypothesis that the animal market played a role in the virus jumping to humans also remains strong. “The linkage back to the market is pretty realistic, and consistent with what we saw with SARS,” said LeDuc. “It’s a perfectly plausible and logical explanation: The virus exists in nature and, jumping hosts, finds that it likes humans just fine, thank you.“

6) State Department officials worried about safety issues at the Wuhan lab in 2018. This is concerning but doesn’t prove its scientists were incompetent.

In an April 14 piece, Josh Rogin, a global opinions columnist for the Washington Post, reported that in January 2018, the US Embassy in Beijing dispatched science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology who later sent back cables that warned of “safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab and proposed more attention and help.”

Rogin went on to cite an anonymous senior administration official’s belief that “the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan.”

The article sparked a rich discussion on Twitter, with Rasmussen of Columbia pointing out, “The bottom line is that those vague diplomatic cables do not provide any specific information suggesting that #SARSCoV2 emerged from incompetence or poor biosafety protocols or anything else.”

I had a great exchange with @JeremyKonyndyk about the state department cables reported yesterday by @joshrogin and the credence they supposedly lend to the ""lab accident"" origin story of #SARSCoV2. Jeremy distilled this into the perfect meme: https://t.co/2CiWvbtt8l — Dr. Angela Rasmussen (@angie_rasmussen) April 15, 2020

In a follow-up conversation with me, she reiterated: “This line that they’re incompetent, it doesn’t hold water with me.”

Other scientists who have worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology have spoken up about its standards and practices in the face of the theory it leaked the virus.

“I have worked in this exact laboratory at various times for the past 2 years,” wrote Danielle Anderson, scientific director of the Duke-NUS Medical School ABSL3 Laboratory, in a March 2 post on Health Feedback, a site where scientists review the veracity of news reports. “I can personally attest to the strict control and containment measures implemented while working there. The staff at WIV are incredibly competent, hardworking, and are excellent scientists with superb track records.”

Gerald Keusch, a professor of medicine and international health and associate director of Boston University’s National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, also doubts the lab would have been prone to accidents.

“The Wuhan lab is (as far as I know because I have never visited) state of the art in terms of safety and security systems and protocols, and because [the Galveston National Laboratory in the US] helped to train many of them and has collaborations I would bet they are highly professional, which makes the likelihood of an accident remote,” he said. “Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? In my opinion, no.”

We may never find out exactly when this virus made the leap into humans. But focusing too much on the lab-leak theory could ultimately be dangerous.

Since there’s no robust evidence in support of the lab-leak theory, Daszak says he’s worried that it could become a conspiratorial distraction with serious consequences.

“There is a group of people who do not want to believe that this is a natural, unfortunate incident,” he said. “And the real bad part of that is that if we don’t believe that we won’t try and stop other viruses in wildlife. Instead, we will focus on labs and close them down when they’re the ones trying to develop vaccines to cure us right now. I mean, how ironic could we go?”

Carroll says the lab-leak theory, even if there isn’t evidence to support it, is a healthy reminder that lab accidents can happen and that biosecurity needs attention in country studying dangerous pathogens. But he’s also much more concerned with preventing the next pandemic.

Pandemics, says Carroll, do not have to happen. “They are a consequence of the way we live. You can pick [viruses] up earlier if you’re really including in your surveillance those places where animals and people are having high-risk interaction, those hot spots.”

If you have that surveillance, “you would never get a virus sweeping out of hand. You would never get a repeat of an uncontrolled, unrecognized event.”

Which means it’s time for the whole world to invest in studying the viruses in the bat caves and beyond, and building up the systems to stop them from spreading in humans, so this doesn’t happen again. Because otherwise, it will.

"['German Lopez', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Why summer likely won’t save us from the coronavirus,"Some Americans are hoping for a natural reprieve to social distancing as the coronavirus pandemic drags on: that sunnier, warmer, and more humid weather in the summer will destroy the Covid-19 virus — as it does with other viruses, like the flu — and let everyone go back to normal.

There is some evidence that heat, humidity, and ultraviolet light could hurt the coronavirus — an idea that President Donald Trump bizarrely leaned into when he suggested the use of “ultraviolet or just very powerful light … inside the body” to treat people sickened by Covid-19 (an idea with no scientific merit, as experts have repeatedly stated).

But even if heat, humidity, and light help slow the virus’s spread, sunny, hot, and humid weather alone won’t be enough to end the epidemic. Experts point to the examples of Singapore, Ecuador, and Louisiana, all of which have recently had growing numbers of Covid-19 cases despite temperatures hitting 80-plus degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels reaching more than 60, 70, or even 80 percent.

High levels of heat, UV light, and humidity can help prevent more widespread infections of the flu or colds in the summer, along with medical treatments and vaccines (when available). But the Covid-19 coronavirus is still new to humans, so we don’t have as much immune protection built up against it — so the virus seems able to overcome summer-like weather and still cause big outbreaks.

“For the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, we have reason to expect that like other betacoronaviruses, it may transmit somewhat more efficiently in winter than summer, though we don’t know the mechanism(s) responsible,” Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard, wrote. “The size of the change is expected to be modest, and not enough to stop transmission on its own.”

Still, the studies on heat, light, and humidity, plus the fact coronavirus has a harder time spreading in open-air areas, suggest that the outdoors may be a safe target for a slow reopening as transmission of the virus slows, as long as precautions like physical distancing and mask-wearing are followed. So outdoor activities could offer a respite to lockdowns and quarantines — one that’s also, potentially, good for physical and mental health.

It also means that if Covid-19 becomes endemic (a disease that regularly comes back, like the flu or common cold), then heat, sunlight, and humidity could restrict bigger outbreaks to fall and winter. But that possibility is likely still years away, experts say.

So summer weather may make the outdoors a little safer, but it won’t be enough to quash coronavirus on its own. That means we’ll likely need to continue social distancing to some degree in the coming months, and continue working on getting more testing, aggressive contact tracing, and medical treatments up to scale before places can safely reopen their economies.

Hotter, more humid weather does seem to hurt the coronavirus

There are a few ways that summer weather could have an effect on SARS-CoV-2. Higher temperatures can help weaken the novel coronavirus’s outer lipid layer, similar to how fat melts in greater heat. Humidity in the air can effectively catch virus-containing droplets that people breathe out, causing these droplets to fall to the ground instead of reaching another human host — making humidity a shield against infection. UV light, which there’s a lot more of during sunny summer days, is a well-known disinfectant that effectively fries cells and viruses.

“There are multiple coronaviruses out there that affect our population, and many of them, if not most of them, exhibit a seasonal influence,” Mauricio Santillana, the director of the Machine Intelligence Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital and a researcher on the effects of the weather on coronavirus, told me. “The hypothesis postulated for Covid-19 is that it will have a similar behavior.”

But that’s hypothetical. How does it play out in reality?

So far, the coronavirus has largely spread in the Northern Hemisphere, where it’s been winter and early spring. It’s not clear if the weather is a reason for that, because data on its spread in the Southern Hemisphere — particularly poorer countries in Africa and South America — is largely lacking due to weak public health infrastructure.

Still, we have some evidence. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine — one of America’s top scientific evidence reviewers — summarized the research earlier in April. It looked at two kinds of studies: those that tested the effects of summer-like temperatures in a laboratory, and those that attempted to tease out the effects of heat, UV light, and humidity in the real world.

In the lab, researchers use sophisticated tools to see how the virus fares in different conditions. Generally, they’ve found more heat, UV light, and humidity seem to weaken the coronavirus — although one preliminary study suggested that coronavirus may fare better in the more summer-like conditions than the flu, SARS, and monkeypox viruses.

This is the kind of study Bill Bryan, the undersecretary for science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, presented at the April 23 White House press briefing. That study found that coronavirus seemed to die off much more quickly in hotter, more humid environments with a lot of UV light.

As the National Academies noted, however, this evidence comes with big caveats. Perhaps most importantly, these studies haven’t yet been peer reviewed. So they could have big methodological errors that we just don’t know about yet. (This Wired article does a good job breaking down the concerns with such early research.)

But even if these studies are well-conducted, the real world is simply a lot messier than a laboratory setting. For example, the lab-grown virus used in these studies may act at least somewhat differently than the natural virus in the real world.

People can also act differently in summer than they do in winter, and the lab studies don’t account for how those behaviors affect coronavirus’s spread. People are more likely to stay indoors during the winter to avoid the cold — but indoor spaces are generally more poorly ventilated and cramped, both of which make it easier for the coronavirus to spread. Warmth and sunshine also could impact the immune system, though that relationship is still unclear.

We’ll get more evidence on real-life seasonal effects as the months go by — especially if more places take potentially dangerous risks. “In Georgia, where they are opening back up without really any concrete measures to encourage distancing, we might be able to better evaluate how [the coronavirus] spreads in the summer months,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia, told me.

But there is some early real-world research already, which the National Academies also reviewed. These studies looked at whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus was affected by different climates in real-world settings, and if it spread more easily in places where it was colder and less humid and there was less UV light. Some researchers also developed models based on data from different outbreaks in different parts of the world.

One upcoming study from a group of researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center tried to model the effects of heat, humidity, and UV light, finding that they mitigated the spread of the virus. UV light seemed to play a bigger role, although the researchers cautioned that their findings will need to be replicated and verified with, ideally, years of data. “This is a very new virus, and there are lots of things we don’t know about it,” Azar Abadi, one of the researchers, told me.

But this aligns with the evidence that the National Academies reviewed.

“There is some evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity,” Harvey Fineberg, author of the National Academies report, wrote. “[H]owever, given the lack of host immunity globally, this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions.”

Heat and humidity won’t be enough to beat the pandemic — far from it

This is the point experts emphasized again and again: It’s one thing for the weather to have some sort of effect on coronavirus; it’s another thing for that effect to be enough to actually halt the virus’s widespread transmission. We have early evidence the weather has an effect, but we also have early evidence that it won’t be enough.

The problem: Other factors, besides the weather, play a role in the spread of diseases. In the case of coronavirus, these other factors seem to play a much bigger role than weather.

The mayor of Guayaquil, Ecuador, where it’s regularly 80-plus degrees Fahrenheit, described her city’s experience with Covid-19 “like the horror of war” and “an unexpected bomb falling on a peaceful town.” Ecuador now has one of the worst coronavirus death tolls in the world — a sign that warm, sunny, and humid weather can’t make up for struggling public health infrastructure in a still-developing country.

Singapore, which is nearly on the equator, managed to contain coronavirus at first, but it has seen a growing outbreak recently. The problem, it seems, is the government neglected migrant workers in its initial response — letting Covid-19 spread in the cramped and sometimes unsanitary conditions many migrants live in. Warm, humid weather alone wasn’t enough to overcome preexisting issues and an overly narrow public policy response.

Meanwhile, Louisiana is suffering a significant coronavirus outbreak, with the fifth-most deaths per 100,000 people out of all the states. According to experts, Mardi Gras — held on February 25 — may have accelerated that. The massive celebration seemed to cause a lot of transmission, even as New Orleans saw temperatures up to the 70s, and cases continued to climb even as temperatures reached the 80s. Maybe the weather made things better than they would be otherwise, but it was, again, no match for human behavior’s effects on the spread of Covid-19.

The bigger problem is too many people in the US are still vulnerable to the virus. “While we see some influence [of the weather], the effect that we’re seeing — if there’s any effect — is eclipsed by the high levels of susceptibility in the population,” Santillana said. “Most people are still highly susceptible. So even if temperature or humidity could play a role, there’s not enough immunity.”

That made it extremely easy for the virus to spread, regardless of the weather, especially since SARS-CoV-2 appears to be so contagious relative to other pathogens. In contrast, if you think about the viruses that are more affected by the seasons — the flu and colds — humans have been dealing with them for hundreds if not thousands of years. That’s let us build some population-level protection that we just don’t have for Covid-19, making other factors besides our actions, like the weather, a bit more important for the seasonal viruses.

So down the line, if Covid-19 becomes endemic — a possibility if, for example, immunity to it isn’t as permanent as we’d like — it’s possible that seasons will have a much stronger sway over when it pops up again.

Even then, it’s worth acknowledging that seasons don’t fully determine when the flu and colds hit. As the National Academies pointed out, some flu pandemics have started in the summer: “There have been 10 influenza pandemics in the past 250-plus years — two started in the northern hemisphere winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall.”

In fact, some of this research could be taken to mean that coronavirus will be even more dangerous eventually: If the colder, dryer weather this fall and winter empowers the virus, that could lead to a bigger outbreak. The National Academies noted, as an example, that a second spike is typical for flu pandemics: “All had a peak second wave approximately six months after emergence of the virus in the human population, regardless of when the initial introduction occurred.”

But, as is true in the reverse, other factors besides the weather likely play a bigger role in the spread. So if governments and the public do the right thing through the fall and winter, there’s still a good chance that there won’t be a big spike.

Americans will likely be social distancing through the summer

The upshot of all of this: The changing weather likely won’t be enough on its own to relax social distancing. Given that there’s still a lot about Covid-19 we still need to learn, experts don’t know this for certain. But it’s what they suspect, based on the data that we’ve seen in the research and real world so far.

“If the only concern is the health of people, it’s irresponsible to go back to relaxing social distancing anytime soon,” Santillana said. “We’re not done, even if summer starts.”

So as the plans to end social distancing indicate, the world will likely need at least some level of social distancing until a vaccine or a similarly effective medical treatment is developed, which is possibly a year or more away. That may not require the full lockdown that several states are seeing today, but it will mean restrictions on larger gatherings and some travel, while perhaps continuing remote learning and work.

“If the only concern is the health of people, it’s irresponsible to go back to relaxing social distancing anytime soon”

Weather could help determine how safe it is to go outside, even as social distancing continues. Some states, for example, are considering opening parks and beaches during the earlier phases of reopening their economies. Experts warn that summer weather won’t allow large gatherings — 50 people or more is often cited as way too many — but it could give people some assurance that they can go outdoors as long as they keep 6 feet or more of distance from others they don’t live with, avoid touching surfaces and their faces, and wear masks.

Otherwise, however, how much social distancing will be relaxed in the coming months won’t come down to the weather but likely how much the US improves its testing and surveillance capacity. Testing gives officials the means to isolate sick people, track and quarantine the people whom those verified to be sick came into close contact with (a.k.a. contact tracing), and deploy community-wide efforts if a new cluster of cases is too large and uncontrolled otherwise.

While the US has seen some gains in testing, the number of new tests a day still fall below estimates of what’s needed (500,000 on the low end and tens of millions on the high end) to safely ease social distancing.

Along with testing, America will need aggressive contact tracing, as countries like South Korea and Germany have done, to control its outbreak. A report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Association of State and Territorial Health estimated the US will need to hire 100,000 contact tracers — far above what states and federal officials have so far said they’re hiring. A phone app could help mitigate the need for quite as many tracers, but it’s unclear if Americans have the appetite for an app that will effectively track their every move.

These are, really, the things everyone has been hearing about the entire time during this pandemic. It’s just worth emphasizing that the summer weather likely won’t be enough on its own to mitigate the need for these other public health strategies.

“The best-case scenario is if we’re doing that [social distancing] and there’s a dampening [in the summer], maybe there is a possibility of limiting this virus here in the United States and other places,” Jesse Bell, one of the University of Nebraska Medical Center researchers, told me. “But then again we just don’t know.”

So we’re very likely going to need social distancing, testing, and contact tracing for the foreseeable future, regardless of how warm, sunny, and humid it is outside.

"['Jen Kirby', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,Jair Bolsonaro undermined Brazil’s coronavirus response. Now there’s a political crisis.,"On April 19, the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, completed construction of a 500-bed field hospital for coronavirus patients at the Riocentro convention center. It’s one of several such hospitals being built in Rio de Janeiro to deal with the growing outbreak there. The state has more than 6,700 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 670 deaths as of April 28.

That same day, on April 19, Brazil’s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro joined a protest outside army headquarters in Brasilia, the country’s capital. There, protesters supported military intervention and demanded an end to lockdown measures state governors in the country have put in place — and which Bolsonaro opposes.

“I am here because I believe in you,” Bolsonaro shouted to the tightly packed protesters. “You are here because you believe in Brazil. We don’t want to negotiate anything; what we want is action for Brazil.”

During his speech to supporters, Bolsonaro, his face uncovered, coughed.

This split-screen moment highlights the strange situation in Brazil, where state governors and public health officials try to battle a deadly pandemic that is threatening to overwhelm the country’s health care system while the elected leader of the country downplays the severity of the virus and fights against their efforts at every turn.

Bolsonaro has referred to the coronavirus as the “little flu” and scoffed at social distancing measures intended to slow the spread of the virus, proclaiming in late March that “we’ll all die one day.” He’s called on citizens to go back to work, directly contradicting the orders of state governors and the recommendations of his public health experts.

Bolsonaro’s reckless response to the coronavirus undercut the country’s ability to manage it and drew outrage, especially from the opposition, for his mishandling of the outbreak. And now Brazil is at the edge of a political crisis, as Bolsonaro is now facing an investigation into possible corruption. This scandal threatens to plunge the country deeper into turmoil in the middle of a pandemic.

“Any political crisis in Brasilia weakens the government’s response to this and reduces the cohesiveness of how states respond,” Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at Fundação Getulio Vargas in São Paolo, told me.

The coronavirus threatens catastrophe in Brazil

Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, with more than 200 million people. It also currently has the continent’s worst outbreak. The health ministry has recorded more than 68,000 cases and approximately 5,000 deaths as of April 28.

But the real toll is almost certainly higher. Brazil, as elsewhere, lacks large-scale testing. Brazilian researchers have estimated that the country likely has 12 times the official number of coronavirus cases. Late last week, Brazil saw some of its largest increases in cases and deaths from the coronavirus, but the pandemic has not yet reached its peak.

“This could be very catastrophic for Brazil,” Karin Nielsen, professor of clinical pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at UCLA, told me, “and it’s already on top of an ongoing crisis, and shortages of medical supplies and medical equipment.”

Brazil has universal public health care, but people with means can buy into a private health care system. Experts told me that the public health system has faced a number of cuts in recent years, brought on by Brazil’s recession in 2015 and the austerity measures that followed.

The system was already overburdened before the coronavirus came along, and now the pandemic is putting even more pressure on those public hospitals, with the number of ICU beds running short in major cities.

“The problem is that in the last years, especially after conservative federal governments were in power, there was a remarkable underfunding of the system, deepening structural and historical problems and increasing regional inequalities,” José Ricardo Ayres, professor of preventative medicine at the medical school at the University of São Paulo, told me in an email.

Ayres said that insufficient and badly distributed intensive-care services are a huge challenge, and compounding this are shortages in basic equipment, like personal protective gear. This problem is not unique to Brazil, but it risks depleting the front-line health care workers, straining the hospital system even more.

Hospitals in the city of Fortaleza, in the northeastern state of Ceará, are almost at capacity, as the virus has spread to every single neighborhood in the city. In Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas, in northwestern Brazil, the city’s daily death rate has risen from 30 to more than 100, though the recorded Covid-19 death toll as of April 23 was just 287, NPR reported.

Cemeteries are digging mass graves as bodies pile up. Mayor Virgílio Neto said Manaus was “no longer in a state of emergency but rather of absolute calamity.”

State governors and mayors across Brazil have implemented stay-at-home orders and shuttered businesses to try to “flatten the curve” and prevent the country’s health care system from collapsing.

São Paulo’s Governor João Doria shut down Brazil’s most populous state on March 24 and has since extended the lockdown, most recently until at least May 10.

Rio de Janeiro’s Gov. Wilson Witzel called for a state of emergency in mid-March, shutting businesses and emptying Rio’s famous beaches. Witzel (who tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in April) has continued to extend the orders until at least April 30.

Bolsonaro has fought these restrictions (more on that in a minute), but even without his meddling, these stay-at-home orders are not always easily enforced across Brazil.

Some of the first-known coronavirus cases recorded in Brazil came from wealthier people traveling abroad, but once the virus seeded in the country, it spread rapidly — including to Brazil’s favelas, the crowded, low-income communities on the outskirts of major cities.

Controlling transmission in these communities is a challenge. People live in very small spaces, often packed tightly with other family members. Homes are stacked one on top of the other. Many of these communities also lack access to clean water and adequate sanitation, making even simple preventative techniques like hand-washing difficult.

How easily Brazilians can social distance, experts told me, is fractured along class lines. Many middle- or upper-class families can stay in their apartments and work from home. But about 40 percent of Brazil’s workforce, or approximately 38 million workers, participates in the informal sector of the economy, which often means people depend on a daily wage to eat and survive.

Reports suggest that the local gangs that control territory in major city favelas are also trying to enforce quarantine measures and distribute supplies, organized crime filling in for where Bolsonaro’s government is failing. Brazil’s government has taken measures, including approving a monthly stipend of 600 reals (a little more than $100) for three months for the unemployed and those who work in the informal economy.

“But it is still insufficient to effectively reduce their vulnerable social situation and susceptibility to Covid-19,” Ayres said in his email. “The higher mortality rates in poorer neighborhoods in São Paulo city is a testimony of it.”

Brazil’s indigenous communities are also in peril, especially in remote areas far from adequate health facilities. And though some of these groups are removed from population centers, they are at greater risk of coming into contact with the disease through miners and loggers, who are often on the land illegally — something that has increased during Bolsonaro’s tenure, as the president has expressed little regard for vulnerable indigenous communities and their protected lands.

“Coronavirus could wipe us out,” Ianucula Kaiabi, an indigenous leader in Brazil’s Xingu national park, told the Guardian at the end of March. About 6,000 people and 16 tribes live in that area of the southern Amazon, and indigenous leaders were trying to seal off roads.

Brazil was always going to have these challenges in the face of a pandemic — but they are even greater when the country’s leader is sending mixed messages about the reality on the ground.

How Bolsonaro is exacerbating Brazil’s coronavirus crisis

In early March, as the coronavirus was taking hold around the world, Bolsonaro traveled to the United States to meet with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. At the time, both leaders had been questioning the seriousness of the virus, but the Mar-a-Lago meeting turned out to be something of a virus hot spot.

Bolsonaro’s top aide tested positive for the virus, as did other US officials who attended the session. Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo told Fox News his father had tested positive but later claimed he didn’t say that. Then Bolsonaro released an official statement saying he’d tested negative and accused the media of spreading fake news.

After his brush with the virus, Bolsonaro, at first, seemed a little contrite: He held a Facebook Live event where he wore a face mask. He also said that the World Health Organization had acted “responsibly” when it declared the coronavirus a pandemic, and discouraged a rally of his supporters.

It didn’t last.

Bolsonaro soon returned to downplaying the severity of the coronavirus threat, calling it a “little flu” and a “measly cold.” He questioned the official statistics (which are likely an undercount), saying governors were manipulating the numbers for political ends. And he dismissed much of the fear, and the human toll, surrounding the virus.

He suggested that vulnerable people — older people and those with underlying conditions — could stay home, but that everyone else needed to go back to their jobs and their regular lives. “We have to face this virus, but face it like a man, dammit, not a boy,” Bolsonaro said in late March. “We have to face it with reality. That’s life. We’re all going to die someday.”

“Protecting jobs is essential,” he added.

Bolsonaro also flouts social distancing guidelines: He does not wear a mask when in public and still shakes hands with supporters — who, in gathering to greet the president, are often squeezed together.

His cavalier approach to the pandemic has put him in direct confrontation with state governors and other local leaders, some of whom used to count themselves among his allies.

In March, after Bolsonaro called for an end to lockdowns, governors in 25 of 27 states kept them in place.

At least two of those governors — Witzel, the Rio governor, and Doria of São Paulo — had previously aligned themselves with Bolsonaro. Witzel won an upset election, campaigning with one of Bolsonaro’s sons. Doria campaigned in 2018 by calling himself “BolsoDoria,” though he’s since said he isn’t a bolsonarista.

Now, though, public safety seems to be trumping political fealty. “We’re fighting against the coronavirus and against the ‘Bolsonaro-virus,’” Doria said in an interview with the Associated Press published on April 16.

“It’s as if you had two parallel kinds of politics,” Flávia Biroli, a political science professor at the Universidade de Brasília, told me. “The governors follow their path, and Bolsonaro keeps screaming and bringing some confusion to people.”

It’s not just governors who have found themselves at odds with the president.

In late March, Bolsonaro launched #BrazilCannotStop, a national campaign encouraging Brazilians to get back to work and normal life — that is, before a federal judge banned the campaign because it undermined state governors’ authorities to impose quarantine measures.

And in mid-April — as the country’s outbreak was getting increasingly dire — Bolsonaro fired his health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta. Mandetta had publicly contradicted Bolsonaro, advocating for social distancing measures and essentially backing the state governors.

It was a difficult path to navigate, given his boss was saying the opposite. Ultimately, Mandetta had enough after Bolsonaro greeted a crowd of supporters outside a hospital, removing his mask and signing autographs.

“Brazilians don’t know whether they should listen to their health minister or to their president,” Mandetta told a Brazilian news program shortly after that incident. Mandetta was out of a job before the week was up.

Many Brazilians and political leaders denounced Mandetta’s firing: Brazilians protested from lockdown, banging pots and pans from windows and calling for Bolsonaro’s ouster. Polls suggest the majority of Brazilians support the social distancing measures and disapprove of Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic.

And Brazil’s Supreme Court has backed up the power of state governments to implement stay-at-home measures, meaning Bolsonaro can complain, but he can’t overrule them. “Bolsonaro wants to be the president of reopening,” Stuenkel told me.

But Bolsonaro’s actions are still potentially dangerous. The president garners a fervent base of support, who tend to fully buy into Bolsonaro’s rhetoric and who are distrustful of the mainstream media. As Bolsonaro agitates against these lockdown measures, so do they. Bolsonaro supporters are protesting the lockdowns and decrying the dire health warnings as “fake news.” In São Paulo, Bolsonaro supporters blocked access to hospitals.

The president’s attitude is “already propagating like wildfire,” UCLA’s Nielsen said, “and it will just be disastrous.”

Bolsonaro’s attitude has also undermined any coherent response from the federal government. A competent Bolsonaro administration would be backing up the states with resources, coordinating the response to make sure supplies get where they’re needed, and helping to acquire gear and other equipment from abroad.

The absence of a unified strategy to fight the pandemic has led to a patchwork of measures across Brazil, with some states easing lockdowns while hospital systems in Brazil’s major cities buckle under the surge of coronavirus patients.

“We should be making the lockdowns better and more restrictive right now, but we’re going the opposite way,” Yago Bertacchini, a 26-year-old lawyer in Maringá, a city in Paraná state in southern Brazil, told me.

Bolsonaro may believe it’s “better to bet on the economy”

“Bolsonaro seems to be betting that he has very few tools to solve the health crisis,” said Matthew Taylor, an associate professor of international studies at American University, “and so he’s better to bet on the economy.”

In other words, Bolsonaro’s emphasis on protecting the economy is strategic. Most experts and people in Brazil I spoke to see it as a way to both deflect from the coronavirus crisis and give himself a solid talking point when the economy does collapse.

“I think he wants to be able to say, at the next election, ‘Those governors stopped you from working; it would have been a lot better if I had been able to prevail,’” Anthony Pereira, professor of Brazilian studies at King’s College in London, told me.

Brazil’s impending economic crisis seems undeniable. The country’s economy is still struggling from a recession in 2015 and 2016, and its economic outlook was not exactly rosy even before the pandemic hit. Brazil’s widening deficit could limit its ability to use stimulus to tackle the economic fallout, and the country also faces higher borrowing costs. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that Brazil could see negative growth greater than 5 percent in 2020.

Bolsonaro may be acting cynically, but the fallout from shuttering restaurants, closing shops, and stalling businesses could be catastrophic — and it could deepen the public health crisis.

The millions in Brazil who rely on informal jobs to survive day to day don’t have many other options. Even those who may want to abide by social distancing measures may not be able to; they’re in a precarious position where they risk their lives either way — by working or by staying home.

“It’s very hard to disentangle the economic crisis and the health crisis,” Biroli, at the Universidade de Brasília, said. “I am really afraid of a near future where we have a deep economic crisis from which it’s going to be hard to sort out alternatives, and a deep health crisis for which the country is not prepared.”

Bolsonaro’s battles over the coronavirus have left him isolated — and now an explosive political crisis is making it worse

The bolsonaristas, his most loyal followers, remain as devoted as ever. They include evangelical Christians, who ardently buy into Bolsonaro’s promises to restore traditional culture, and those with a nostalgia for the country’s authoritarian past, such as the protesters earlier this month who wanted the military to intervene on behalf of Bolsonaro to help overrule lockdown measures.

But the bolsonaristas alone did not bring Bolsonaro to power. He also needed buy-in from the establishment. So he brought in technocrats and those who embraced a more traditionally right-wing agenda, like smaller government and a more free market, liberal economic ideology.

Bolsonaro needed their backing to win over moderates who were wary of his more radical rhetoric. These individuals, in turn, were sometimes expected to act as moderating and disciplining forces on an unpredictable president — the “adults in the room,” if you will.

“We’re fighting against the coronavirus and against the ‘Bolsonaro-virus’”

That somewhat fragile coalition has splintered as the president has bungled the coronavirus crisis. His battles against state governors have weakened him politically, as did his decision to fire the health minister. He doesn’t have robust support in Brazil’s congress, and impeachment chatter has percolated, backed up by Brazil’s mainstream press.

The louder Bolsonaro yelled about reopening the economy, the more isolated he became.

Then, on Friday, the discontent over the coronavirus boiled over, though not exactly because of the pandemic.

Bolsonaro’s popular Justice Minister Sérgio Moro resigned after Bolsonaro fired the chief of the federal police, Maurício Valeixo, without a clear reason. And just like that, a political crisis threatened to overshadow both the public health and economic crises.

Moro has a reputation as an anti-corruption hardliner; he was the federal judge who presided over Brazil’s sprawling 2014 corruption scheme known as Operation Car Wash. The corruption scandal involved bribes between politicians, executives at the country’s state-run oil company, and everyone in between.

Moro’s legacy has been tarnished somewhat after the Intercept published a major investigation that showed Moro had collaborated with prosecutors to help convict high-level figures, including former leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. That undermined Moro’s reputation for impartiality and fairness, but not entirely.

Which is why Moro’s resignation was so explosive. Upon his departure, Moro delivered an exit speech, and he did not hold back. He accused Bolsonaro of trying to meddle in law enforcement, saying the president had fired Valeixo because he wanted “a person he could be in touch with personally, whom he could call directly, from whom he could receive information, intelligence reports.”

There are plenty of good guesses about why Bolsonaro might have wanted to replace Valeixo with a police chief more favorable to him, though nothing definitive yet. Top among them are investigations into those close to Bolsonaro, including his sons.

His son Flávio, who is a state senator, has been under investigation for some time for an alleged money-laundering scheme in which he is accused of using public funds to pay nonexistent employees, including at a chocolate shop in Rio de Janeiro.

And then there’s Carlos, another son and politician, who is being investigated by federal police for organizing fake news attacks that smeared justices on the Supreme Court. The Folha de São Paulo news outlet reports that federal police had homed in on Carlos as the ringleader of the group, and that police were also looking into the role of Eduardo, yet another Bolsonaro son (and Steve Bannon associate), in the alleged fake news ring. (Carlos and Eduardo have dismissed the fake news allegations as, well, false.)

Brazilian media has suggested that Bolsonaro wanted to push out Valeixo to get control of this case against his sons. But Bolsonaro has been defiant: “The prerogative is mine, and the day I have to submit to any of my subordinates, I cease to be president of the republic,” the president said last week.

But Moro’s words carried serious weight, and Brazil’s attorney general referred Moro’s allegations to the Supreme Court. On Monday, a Supreme Court justice authorized a 60-day investigation into whether Bolsonaro engaged in corruption or obstruction of justice in his firing of Valeixo.

So, in the middle of a deadly pandemic and a worsening economic crisis, Brazil’s president is under investigation.

Calls for lawmakers to act against Bolsonaro are growing louder, but experts I spoke to aren’t sure Brazil’s Congress will want to take up impeachment in the middle of a pandemic. But if the Supreme Court finds Bolsonaro acted illegally, that could force Congress’s hand.

Which means that, for right now, much about Brazil’s future is uncertain — except that people are dying every day. As Bertachinni, the lawyer in Maringá, told me: “We are not even close to the worst.”

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,How China is ruthlessly exploiting the coronavirus pandemic it helped cause,"The coronavirus pandemic that rages across the globe is a fire China helped light. And now, while Beijing grasps a fire hose with two hands, it’s also planting a boot on the world’s neck.

The Chinese government spent weeks denying and downplaying the severity of its growing coronavirus outbreak that eventually spread to the rest of the world. That obfuscation cost nations crucial time in preparing for and potentially curbing the damage of Covid-19. Some experts Vox spoke with believe President Xi Jinping’s regime should be held accountable for the more than 3 million infections and 200,000 deaths that have taken place worldwide.

But China isn’t letting the crisis go to waste. Instead of looking to make amends, Beijing is taking advantage of the chaos to pursue its long-term foreign policy goals more aggressively.

“When it sees opportunities, China moves to exploit them,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, DC. “And we are in a moment where the Chinese definitely see opportunities.”

China has capitalized on the world’s distraction to claim sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea, intimidate Taiwan, and assert more authority over Hong Kong in an attempt to quash the pro-democracy movement there.

It’s taken advantage of vulnerable countries in Africa that are struggling to cope with the coronavirus and its economic impact by offering much-needed debt relief — but only if those countries provide lucrative national assets as collateral.

And after the US suspended funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) for allegedly being too cozy with Beijing, the Chinese government pledged millions of dollars in additional support for the organization, giving China even more influence in the global health agency and allowing the country to portray itself as the new champion of multilateralism.

Amid all this, China has launched a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the virus onto other countries — for instance, alleging the virus really originated in the US, or maybe in Italy. It also sent needed medical equipment and doctors to heavily impacted countries where it seeks to expand its influence, allowing Beijing to play the hero of the pandemic instead of the villain.

“Everything they’re doing is a full-court press,” said Michael Sobolik, an expert on China at the American Foreign Policy Council. “Across the board, China is pushing hard.”

Experts say this is all part of Xi’s broader strategy to dislodge America as the world’s sole superpower and expand China’s reach around the world. In other words, he’s merely exploiting the coronavirus crisis to achieve his aims even faster.

Make China Great Again, but faster

Andrew Erickson, an expert on China at the US Naval War College, has no doubts about what Xi and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) want.

“To the extent that any nation has a grand strategy, China surely does. The vision is no secret: Xi Jinping vows to make China great again,” Erickson wrote for War on the Rocks in October 2019. “Xi’s strategy for a modern China of unprecedented power and influence requires recapturing lost glories at home and abroad.”

Xi himself has said as much. During a major speech in October 2017, he named specific timelines for his grandiose goals: China would have a “moderately prosperous society in all respects” by 2021; it would be a world leader in technology and military modernization by 2035; and by 2049, Beijing’s decades-long dispute with Taiwan would be resolved.

Those are big promises made on tight deadlines. It’s no surprise, then, that Xi wouldn’t waste a chance to make progress on those plans. “If you have the opportunity to step on the gas, you seize it,” said Aaron Friedberg, a China expert at Princeton University.

And seize it China has.

On April 14, President Donald Trump announced the US would temporarily halt funding to the WHO, arguing that the global health body is too “China centric” and was too lenient on Beijing in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

And just two weeks later, China publicly pledged an additional $30 million in funding to the WHO. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said Beijing donated the money because it was “defending the ideals and principle of multilateralism and upholding the status and authority of the United Nations.”

Few believe it was an altruistic move. Rather, most say it was opportunistic: The US left a leadership void, and China quickly stepped in to fill it. With just a (relatively) small donation, Beijing gets to look like a staunch advocate of global cooperation and a responsible partner in the public health response to the coronavirus, in contrast to the US.

“Thirty million is drop in the bucket,” Sobolik said. “If they wanted to contribute more, they absolutely could contribute more. But it’s really a signal to the White House and the world that the US may not have as much clout as it thinks.”

America’s pause on WHO funding, then, played right into China’s hands. “It’s a gift from the Trump administration,” Glaser told me.

Xi has also used the distraction of the coronavirus pandemic to exert more authority in Hong Kong and crack down on the pro-democracy movement there.

On April 18, more than a dozen pro-democracy activists and lawmakers were arrested in Hong Kong, marking the largest single-day roundup in years. One of those detained was Martin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party, who has since blasted Beijing for trying to impose complete authority over the city.

“Hong Kong people now face two plagues from China: the coronavirus and attacks on our most basic human rights,” he wrote in the Washington Post three days after his arrest. “We can all hope a vaccine is soon developed for the coronavirus. But once Hong Kong’s human rights and rule of law are rolled back, the fatal virus of authoritarian rule will be here to stay.”

Beijing has also started to publicly weigh in on domestic Hong Kong politics in a new way. For instance, in mid-April, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, the Chinese state agency that closely oversees Hong Kong, criticized some of the city’s lawmakers for filibustering debates, which it said has led to a backlog of legislation.

Taken together, experts say Beijing is using the coronavirus as a cover to cement its authoritarian rule over Hong Kong and stamp out the pro-democracy movement once and for all.

China is also trying to spread that rule elsewhere.

Beijing has long laid claim to disputed islands in the South China Sea. To stake its claim, Chinese naval vessels have pushed other claimants, like the Philippines and Vietnam, out of the area so it can have full control of the islands and the oil and natural gas resources around them.

That practice hasn’t stopped during the pandemic. Earlier this month, for example, a Chinese ship sank a Vietnamese fishing boat in the South China Sea and claimed other regional islands for itself.

“China may be hoping to both send a message to other countries involved in the South China Sea that China will not back down under any circumstances, and send a message to a domestic population about the strong leadership of the party,” Kelsey Broderick, a China analyst at the Eurasia Group consulting firm, told CNBC on April 13.

China’s military, meanwhile, continues to place pressure on Taiwan, including by regularly flying fighter jets near Taiwanese airspace and sending flotillas close to the island. This is relatively normal behavior — Beijing puts on this kind of show of force all the time — but the US clearly sees an extra layer of threat in these times. US warships, which usually sail by Taiwan about once a month, have been in the area at least twice in April.

And China is also flexing its muscles on other continents, especially in Africa. Many African governments struggling to respond to the coronavirus are asking for debt relief so they can invest more in health care, sanitation, food, and social programs to keep millions of people safe during the pandemic.

China, one of the continent’s largest creditors, is balking at the idea of large-scale debt relief out of fear it might set a bad precedent of debt forgiveness. And according to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese leaders have asked officials from at least one country, Zambia, to provide collateral — in this case, Zambian copper-mining assets — in exchange for economic help.

Experts Vox spoke with aren’t surprised by this, as they say China has a very transactional view of foreign policy: If Beijing gives something, it gets something. Giving African countries billions of dollars in economic loans only to never see a return on that investment would be anathema to how Chinese officials view the purpose of loans.

But acting this way in the time of Africa’s need may sour once-budding Sino-African relations. It doesn’t help that racism against Africans in China has increased during the coronavirus crisis, leading many to be barred from hotels, restaurants, shops, and more.

Frank Nnabugwu, a Nigerian businessman who lives in the city of Guangzhou, said authorities wouldn’t let him return to his rented home. “The security guards said to us: ‘No foreigners are allowed,’” Nnabugwu told the Guardian on Monday. “I was upset, very upset. I slept on the street.”

Put together, it’s clear China hasn’t reevaluated its foreign policy during a dangerous period for which it shares blame. It’s instead redoubled efforts to see it come true. That, in effect, is China on the offensive.

But Beijing is also using other measures — mainly a large-scale disinformation campaign — to play defense.

China is using Russia’s disinformation playbook to deflect blame. It’s not working.

As calls for China to take responsibility for the pandemic grow, Beijing has chosen to push back in a major way. And to do that, it’s taken a page out of Russia’s playbook, said Jessica Brandt, an expert on Chinese disinformation at the German Marshall Fund.

First, China is peddling conspiracy theories about the virus’s beginnings. It’s well established that the coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, before it spread to the rest of the world. Yet Chinese officials, including Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, have falsely suggested the coronavirus first sprang up in the United States. The same goes for Italy, as Chinese propaganda has also pointed to the European country as a potential starting point for the disease.

2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) March 12, 2020

This is a classic Russian disinformation technique, Brandt said. Instead of coming up with a new theory based on facts, the regime repeats a false claim until it makes enough people doubt the truth.

“For China to be using official channels to promote conspiracy theories is new,” Brandt told me.

Brandt also noted that there’s been a 300 percent increase in the number of Chinese officials on Twitter over the past year, starting around the time the Hong Kong protests began in spring 2019. That’s likely part of the country’s effort to better spread disinformation far and wide.

Chinese officials are also sending medical equipment and physicians to countries in Europe that are struggling to deal with coronavirus outbreaks. The regime made a big deal about offering support to Italy in March, when it had one of the world’s worst outbreaks. It has also sent supplies and resources to Serbia, the Netherlands, and Spain.

Beijing’s reason for doing all of this isn’t pure altruism or even a recognition of its own responsibility in helping create the crisis in the first place. Rather, experts say China is trying to counter negative press about its early mishandling of the virus outbreak.

Instead of being the irresponsible government whose failures unleashed a deadly pandemic on the world, China is trying to look like the world’s savior, graciously providing critical supplies to countries in need.

But the countries it has chosen to help aren’t just the ones who need it the most. They’re also countries that Beijing has been working to build close ties with for the past several years — both to expand its economic reach in Europe and to weaken US alliances in the region.

Italy, for example, was the first major European country to sign on to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing’s trillion-dollar plan to build infrastructure and economic ties across three continents in order to dominate global trade.

By providing Italy and other key European nations with critical aid during the pandemic, China further cements its ties to those countries and chips away at their relationships with the US.

“China and Europe will inevitably get closer,” the Chinese Ministry of National Defense’s Zhou Bo wrote for the South China Morning Post last week. “A divided Europe, further dismayed by the worsening transatlantic relationship, will naturally look east.”

All in all, China is doing only things that help China — nothing more. “Communist Party leaders are working overtime to polish China’s image as a global leader in the response to the Covid-19 crisis,” Jennifer Staats, an expert on the country at the US Institute of Peace, told me.

The problem for China, though, is that the plan has started to backfire.

China’s methods make cooperation, including with the US, nearly impossible

China’s global PR campaign has yielded some fruit.

“We should thank them with all our hearts, they have proven to be great friends of Serbia and Serbs,” Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on March 21, after China delivered medical equipment to the country. “I am waiting for Xi to visit Serbia and hundreds of thousands of people will welcome him.”

Other European officials, including Italy’s foreign minister, have also helped praise on Beijing. But some countries are starting to get fed up with Beijing’s pressure tactics and posturing.

Take Australia. When the Australian government launched a global effort to open an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese officials threatened economic retaliation.

“Maybe the ordinary people will say, ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?’” Cheng Jingye, China’s ambassador to Australia, said in a recent interview with the Australian Financial Review. “The parents of the students would also think ... whether this is the best place to send their kids.”

But instead of caving to Beijing’s demands, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne spoke out. “We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,” she said in a statement Monday.

Countries have also been complaining about the low quality of China-provided supplies. For instance, some of the tests Beijing gave to European nations don’t work. Spanish scientists have found that testing devices from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology correctly identify a positive case around 30 percent of the time.

That hasn’t grown China’s prestige on the continent. “You can’t chest-beat and deliver substandard quality,” Brandt said.

In total, experts say that China’s aggressive attempts to exploit the pandemic for its own benefit have made it harder for governments — especially the United States — to trust and work with the country. “I think at this point it’s going to be hard to cooperate, even though it would be in the interest of” every country, including the US, said Princeton’s Friedberg.

That could have deadly results. If China doesn’t work in concert with other countries, experts say, the disease could continue to spread. After all, it’s a rich, powerful country that can help find a vaccine, fund further pandemic research, and help safeguard borders.

China’s actions, then, not only make the world less safe but also don’t help it attain the global prestige the regime seeks. “Across the board, I don’t think that they’re winning on this,” Friedberg added.

"['German Lopez', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,America still needs more coronavirus testing. Trump’s new plan falls short.,"President Donald Trump’s new coronavirus testing overview and blueprint, announced Monday, read a lot like an abdication.

The plan offers little in the way of actual assurances to the states while insisting that most of the work of scaling up testing will be left to them. It calls on states to develop their own plans and identify hurdles on their own. It says nothing specific about what steps — if any — the federal government will take to increase the number of tests, instead passing the buck to others. The federal government, the plan says, is merely a “supplier of last resort.”

In fact, it’s not clear if the plan will significantly increase testing. In unveiling the plan on Monday, administration officials promised the US will reach at least 8 million tests a month by the end of May. That’s roughly 260,000 tests a day — barely more than the 220,000 a day that the US already averaged over the past week, based on the Covid Tracking Project, which is compiling testing numbers for every state.

Experts say far more testing is needed. On the low end, they’ve called for at least 500,000 tests a day. At the high end, some have called for as many as tens of millions of tests a day, which they say would let public health officials truly track and subsequently contain the full outbreak without as much social distancing.

This much testing is, however, expensive. Paul Romer, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, has projected that the US needs more than 20 million tests each day, effectively letting the country test each person in the country every two weeks. He estimated that would cost $100 billion — which may sound like a lot, but it pales in comparison to the cost of keeping the economy shut down.

But the only way that level of investment in testing will happen, particularly as cities and states deal with tight budgets, is if the federal government gets more involved. Congress already allocated $25 billion to testing and contact tracing in a recent bill, which will start to chip away at the gaps but falls short of Romer’s proposal.

The current testing gaps come down to supply. The White House has said that the US currently has the machines to conduct more than 2 million tests a day. But a shortfall of supplies for tests — due to a lack of swabs for collecting samples and reagents for the tests themselves — has kept the US from reaching anywhere close to that number.

This is a giant obstacle to safely reopening the economy. Every major plan to combat the pandemic and pull back social distancing relies on testing to fully understand the extent of the outbreak and keep it in check. Without that, the only options are more social distancing, with the economic harm that entails, or letting the pandemic run its course — at the cost of potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of lives.

The White House, however, has offered no concrete answers on what the country will do next to fix this problem.

What Trump’s testing plan calls for

Trump’s new testing guidance is broken down into two parts: an overview and a blueprint.

The overview largely provides a summary of the situation so far, detailing how the federal government has waived regulations, provided some supplies to states, and partnered with private businesses to scale up testing. But it leaves out the failures — particularly how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention botched its original test and took weeks to fix the mistake, as well as how the Food and Drug Administration moved slowly to let private labs conduct tests.

Trump insisted in his press conference on Monday that the US is “lapping the world on testing,” but the data simply doesn’t reflect that. When accounting for population, the US testing rate is a little more than half of Italy’s, one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic. It’s about two-thirds of Germany’s, which has been widely praised for its quick response to the crisis.

Moving forward, the blueprint explains what should be expected from the federal government, the local, tribal, and state governments, and the private sector.

The short of it: The plan downplays the role of the federal government and calls on cities, states, tribal governments, and the private sector to do much more. The federal role in the blueprint amounts to little more than providing some guidance and technical assistance here and there. The role for everyone else is sweeping — establish plans, identify problems, and implement solutions. There are few specifics for how exactly any of this can and will get done.

According to Trump’s White House, the federal government’s role is to provide general guidelines and “strategic direction and technical assistance,” including on testing supplies and capacity. It will ease regulations, partnering with the private sector when needed, and accelerate research. If problems with the supply chain persist, it will “act as supplier of last resort.”

Local, tribal, and state governments, meanwhile, have to actually develop and implement testing plans — including maximizing the use of testing platforms and venues, figuring out how to “identify and overcome barriers to efficient testing,” and developing broader monitoring and rapid response programs. And the private sector will be responsible for accelerating the production of tests and the supplies needed for them.

It’s, in other words, a largely local and state-driven approach.

That’s in many ways the opposite of what Trump’s Democratic critics have suggested. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee for president, has called for a “Pandemic Testing Board” that would mirror federal oversight of defense production during World War II. “This isn’t rocket science,” Biden said in a statement. “It just takes investment and execution — both of which have been gravely lacking.”

Trump’s plan is also at odds with what many experts are calling for. In a letter released this week, Scott Gottlieb, who previously served as Trump’s FDA commissioner, and former public health officials from both political parties called on the federal government to take charge not just on testing but community monitoring and surveillance for the coronavirus. “This is fundamental to our ability to begin to reopen our economy while continuing to safeguard American lives,” the ex-officials wrote.

More could be coming. Under a recently enacted law, Congress allocated $25 billion for testing and required the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a “strategic testing plan” that will, among other things, boost testing capacity. What that looks like, and how it differs from the White House’s new set of guidelines, remains to be seen.

America needs way more testing

The reality is America simply needs way more testing.

The US has scaled up testing since the start of the pandemic. At the beginning of April, the number of tests averaged around 150,000 a day. That was up to around 220,000 during the week of April 21.

But that falls short of the 500,000 to tens of millions of tests a day that experts have called for.

Testing gives officials the means to isolate sick people, track and quarantine the people whom those verified to be sick came into close contact with (a.k.a. contact tracing), and deploy community-wide efforts if a new cluster of cases is otherwise too large and out of control.

Other countries, like South Korea and Germany, have paired high levels of testing with aggressive contact tracing to control their outbreaks. A report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Association of State and Territorial Health estimated the US will need to hire 100,000 contact tracers — far above what states and federal officials have so far said they’re hiring. A phone app could help cut down on the need for quite as many tracers, but it’s unclear if Americans have the appetite for an app that will effectively track their every move.

This will, again, require a significant federal investment — to the tune of tens of billions more dollars. States and cities, cash-strapped due to the economic downturn, simply don’t have the financial means to act on their own. They also have little influence over how, for example, to fix supply shortages that are originating in other cities and states.

Trump’s testing overview and blueprint simply don’t provide assurances on these fronts. Instead of calling for a bigger investment and strong federal leadership, it leaves a bulk of the work to states, calling on them to set up their own plans and identify and fix their own problems. The federal government, with its “guidelines,” “strategic direction,” and “technical assistance,” will largely play a supplemental role.

"['Brian Resnick', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,What Covid-19 antibody tests say — and don’t say — about immunity,"Recently, the World Health Organization put out a buzzkill of a statement: “There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.”

Ugh, right?

In the United States, over a million people have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 as of April 28. Most of those people have recovered from the virus, and want to know if they’re protected going forward. Others who experienced mild symptoms or none at all may want an antibody test to see if they were infected.

At first glance, the WHO statement is confusing: Isn’t the presence of antibodies — the molecules your immune system makes to target and stop a specific virus — a good thing? Aren’t they typically the thing you need to fight off another viral infection?

They’re certainly not a bad sign. But experts in immunology and virology tell me that the WHO is right: The detection of antibodies to Covid-19 is not enough to declare a person immune because we don’t yet know how immunity to this virus works.

“We don’t yet have reliable data about protective immunity,” Angela Rasmussen, a Columbia University virologist, says. Much more scientific work needs to be done to make sure the presence of, and quality of, antibodies detected in a test confers immunity. Scientists also need to figure out how long that immunity lasts. Finally, there are also concerns about the reliability of some of the antibody tests. It’s not helpful if antibody tests have a high rate of false positives and false negatives.

All this doesn’t mean the antibody tests are useless; they may still play a crucial role in helping us understand how to beat this pandemic.

But the WHO doesn’t want anyone who tests positive for antibodies to feel like they’ve acquired a superpower. “There is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an ‘immunity passport’ or ‘risk-free certificate,’” the WHO says.

Positive antibody tests are certainly suggestive of immunity, but they don’t show the complete picture of immunity. Here’s what will.

Most antibody tests just test for the presence of antibodies, not the quality of them.

First off, antibodies: What are they?

Antibodies are molecules produced by your adaptive immune system. This is the system that creates and mounts an individualized defense to a particular pathogen that enters your body. Antibodies are specific: They target one antigen (i.e., a foreign infectious protein, like those found on a virus) and help clear it from our bodies. There are all sorts of antibodies. There are ones that merely tag a virus and call for other immune cells to react to it. And then there are neutralizing antibodies: These are the molecules that will prevent a virus or pathogen from infecting more of your cells.

“When you first get infected with SARS-Cov-2, it usually takes anywhere from 10 to 14 days to make antibodies that are effective,” says Vineet Menachery, an immunologist who studies coronaviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch. “That immunity actually peaks between four and eight weeks after you’ve been infected. The antibodies are really powerful at that point.”

Ideally, doctors want to find neutralizing antibodies in someone who has recovered from Covid-19. But that’s trickier than it sounds.

“There are two main types of antibody tests,” Menachery explains. The first just looks for antibodies and can be completed in a few hours. This is called an ELISA test (short for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).

How the test works is kind of simple in concept. “The test relies on a plate that is coated with a viral protein of interest,” the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security explains. Basically, the blood of a person is added to that plate, and the test just looks for whether there are any antibodies that stick to the viral protein. A positive ELISA test tells a doctor there are antibodies in the blood. But, critically, it does not tell them much about their quality.

The second test is more involved, and rarer. It’s called a serum neutralization test, and it takes a few days to process. It not only looks for antibodies, it then exposes those antibodies to a virus in a cell culture to see how effective the antibodies are in stopping the virus.

Ideally, scientists will correlate the two tests and figure out which concentrations of antibodies confer the highest level of immunity. “This work is ongoing,” Menachery says. It’s still not known what levels of antibodies are needed to have lasting, protective immunity. (Scientists are also still working out whether the presence of antibodies also means you can’t give the virus to someone else.)

Scientists will need to study immunity over time

Serum neutralization studies aren’t the only thing needed to crack the immunity code.

That’s because what happens in a little pool of blood may not always translate to what happens in the vastly complex human body. We also need further studies called “correlate of protection studies.” These are longitudinal studies that track patients over time, “following them to see if they develop reinfection; and comparing the antibody levels and other immune markers between those who are reinfected and those who are not,” Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, says. “There are other study designs, but this is the overall concept.”

There have been reports of a few patients out of China who had mild symptoms of Covid-19 who did not have detectable neutralizing antibodies after recovery, though they did have another form of antibody that binds to the virus. “It’s unclear whether they have protective immunity,” Nature reports. Tracking these sorts of people long term, for instance, can help us better understand what mix of antibodies is necessary for enduring immunity.

These types of longitudinal studies take a long time to produce data. But in the meantime, researchers can also look at results from convalescent plasma therapy trials to gauge which antibodies, and in what numbers, are most likely to neutralize the virus. Convalescent plasma therapy is when parts of the blood of people who have recovered from the disease are used to treat those still experiencing symptoms. That plasma contains antibodies. And if these trials are effective, “that suggests that antibodies are capable of neutralizing virus,” Rasmussen says.

Another unanswered question: How long does immunity last?

Even if people do become immune, “one thing we don’t know about still is how long that immunity would last,” Rasmussen says. “And that’s unfortunately not something we can determine until we wait months or years in the future, and test again and see if those antibodies are still there.”

For reasons scientists don’t quite understand, for some infections, someone’s immunity never wanes. People who are immune to smallpox, for example, are immune for life: Antibodies that protect against smallpox have been found as long as 88 years after a vaccination.

Less reassuring here is that scientists have observed antibody levels for other coronaviruses (there are four coronavirus strains that infect people as the common cold) can wane over a period of years. A few weeks after an infection, antibody levels will be at their highest. But “a year from now, that number is likely going to be a little bit lower, and five years from now it’s likely to be potentially a lot lower or a little bit lower, and we don’t know the factors that change that,” Menachery says.

Adding to the pessimism: Just recently, Columbia University researchers published a preliminary study that found that some people got reinfected with a coronavirus (one that causes the common cold) within a year.

However, even if you lose the antibodies, it doesn’t mean you are again completely susceptible to the virus. Yes, none of this is simple.

There have been a few experiments where people were voluntarily exposed to a coronavirus strain that produces a common cold. These studies show it’s common for the antibodies to these other coronavirus strains to decline after a year or so.

“The majority of people that don’t have serum-neutralizing antibodies [i.e., antibodies that take out the virus], they get infected again, but they didn’t get that sick,” Menachery says. You couldn’t do this type of test for Covid-19, he adds; it’s too dangerous

Luckily, even if your antibodies against a coronavirus decline, your body has a backup plan.

Certain types of B-cells (immune system cells that make antibodies) become memory B-cells. These save the instructions for producing a particular antibody, but they aren’t active. Instead, they hide out — in your spleen, in your lymph nodes, perhaps at the original site of your infection — waiting for a signal to start producing antibodies again.

With the memory B-cells in reserve, instead of waiting two weeks or more to get antibody production going, “you’ll only have to wait maybe two or three days,” Menachery says. “So that means, yes, you can get infected again, but you may not even know you’re sick. If you do get sick, maybe it’s a very minor infection.”

Generally, he says, the more severe your infection, the more antibodies your immune system will produce, and the longer they’ll stay in your bloodstream post-infection. So, he says, “there is some concern that if you had a mild infection that your level of protection may not last long.”

People with antibodies are probably immune for at least some months. But in this pandemic, probably isn’t good enough.

All that said, antibody tests are still useful. They help a person understand if they have been exposed to the virus. And they can help our public health understanding of how to beat this pandemic.

Antibody serology (blood) tests “are giving you a snapshot,” Sarah Cobey, a scientist who models epidemiology and immunity at the University of Chicago, says. The snapshot is of how many people have come into contact with the virus. If we compare snapshots, “we can start to try to measure the impacts of different things like school closures versus workplace closures versus shelter in place, and isolation and quarantine.” To sum up: Widespread antibody testing can help us understand which public health measures are working to beat this virus.

But on the individual level, if you get an antibody test back and it’s positive, what should you do?

Well, for one, know that the tests may be of varying quality and accuracy. The Food and Drug Administration “has not reviewed the vast majority of tests on the market, and their validity, particularly point-of-care blood tests that promise rapid results within minutes, isn’t clear,” Kaiser Health News reports. More work needs to be done to validate the tests and make sure the tests can distinguish antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and antibodies for other viruses in the coronavirus family.

But, overall, a positive antibody test “probably means that the person is likely protected from second infection,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiology professor at the Yale School of Medicine, says. But it does not say whether a person is still infectious. And it does not necessarily mean that person is immune to future Covid-19 infections. Or if they are immune, it’s unclear how long that protective immunity might last.

So what should one do?

“Keeping social distancing behavior until we know better what antibody results mean is a good idea,” Iwasaki says.

"['Emily Stewart', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,"The debate about whether expanded unemployment insurance is too generous, explained","Fran, a nursing aide in Georgia, has lost all but two clients amid the coronavirus crisis. She’s an essential worker, but the pay isn’t good — $8 to $12 an hour, depending on the client. Her husband was laid off from his factory job at the start of the month because of the economic shutdown, and the unemployment benefits he receives are now keeping them both afloat. She’s heard the chatter about expanded unemployment insurance being too generous, but she’s not having it.

“It’s not their fault that their unemployment is more, they didn’t want to stop working,” she told me. “A lot of people are living on the unemployment because they didn’t have a choice, they were out of work. Most of the problem lies with how much essential workers were getting in the first place.”

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, signed into law in March made a major change to the American unemployment insurance system to respond to the pandemic, which has left millions of people out of work. It tacks on an extra $600 per week to unemployment benefits through July and expands the pool of potential recipients to people who are self-employed, freelancers, and contract workers who are usually ineligible to collect. The point of the expansion is two-fold: to help people stay afloat during the economic shutdown, and to keep them at home.

When the $2.2 trillion stimulus package was being debated, some Republicans in the Senate argued it was being too nice to unemployed workers, noting that for many people, unemployment benefits may actually amount to more than they’d be paid if they were going to work. Indeed, in many states, beefed-up unemployment insurance is greater than the average wages being replaced.

Beyond the politics of it, the situation has caused real tensions for people affected. Expanded unemployment is a source of animosity among some essential workers who realize they’re making less than they would if they were unemployed. Some would rather quit, stay at home, where they’re safe, and collect benefits, but they’re in a tough spot — unemployment is generally for people who are fired, laid off, or furloughed, not people who voluntarily leave their jobs. And as certain states begin to reopen parts of their economies, more people are going to face a similar conundrum: go back to work and put their health at risk, or stay home and bet on unemployment, even though collecting benefits is far from guaranteed.

Adding an extra $600 a week makes a real difference. It’s supposed to.

Typically, unemployment benefits were meant to replace about 40 percent of a person’s weekly earnings, explained Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. In February, before the pandemic took hold, the average unemployment benefit nationally was $387, though it varies a lot by state — the average in Mississippi was $215, in Massachusetts, it was $550. Adding on an extra $600 makes a big difference.

“It just transforms the whole system,” Burtless said. “For people with average pay or below-average pay, it’s a very big weekly benefit if they ever receive it.”

More than 26 million people have filed new jobless claims over the span of five weeks amid the pandemic and accompanying economic shutdown. Unemployment systems across the country have been jammed, meaning many people haven’t begun collecting benefits at all — more than two-thirds of jobless Americans didn’t get unemployment benefits in March. But if and when people do get the money they’re entitled to, for many, it will make a real impact. That’s the point.

“Part of the way I like to frame this is there are different problems we’re trying to solve for,” said Bradley Hardy, a professor of public administration and policy at American University. “The first part of the problem providing liquidity to individuals and families so they can pay for their lives, maintain their wellbeing, economically and otherwise.”

In other words, it’s meant to keep people afloat.

The expanded benefits are also supposed to keep people home and allow them to social distance, helping to bring down numbers of coronavirus cases, the ultimate goal. The benefits are supposed to keep people who are laid off or furloughed in their homes instead of knocking on doors trying desperately to get reemployed so they can feed themselves or their families.

And in many states, unemployment benefits — if you can get them — are a good deal, and indeed, a better deal than going to work. According to an analysis from the New York Times, workers in more than half of states will get more in unemployment benefits than their regular salaries, on average.

There’s a tension here, but not the one some Republicans are stressing

While the CARES Act was being debated, some Republican lawmakers flagged that expanded unemployment benefits would likely be more than many people make at their jobs. “This bill pays you more not to work than if you were working,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters at a press conference in March. The concern he and others expressed was that the expanded benefits would disincentivize people from going back to work.

But part of the plan is to keep people home instead of scrambling to find a job. The expanded benefits are temporary — as it stands, they only last through July — and many people prefer to work anyway.

Brandon Lee, a sanitation worker in Ohio, makes $14 an hour, which amounts to $560 a week if he’s getting 40 hours, which he sometimes doesn’t. He has a 10-month-old son and looked into unemployment so he could stay home and take care of him, but decided against it. “I’d rather be working, honestly, but I’m kind of happy I’m working,” he told me.

But many workers like Lee who have been deemed essential and are still on the job have noticed that unemployment is indeed a more lucrative deal than their own situations. Many of the jobs deemed “essential” — at grocery stores, fast food restaurants, pharmacies, elder care, etc. — are also low-paying. For some parents who are continuing to go to work, their costs are actually increasing because their kids are home and they’re having to pay extra for child care. One Minnesota factory worker told me they make $16 an hour but are now paying $10 an hour for child care.

“There is a tension there, and the tension is whether there will eventually be some perceived unfairness of treating people who are staying at home and trying to avoid the risk of infection while these people who are exposing themselves to that risk are not necessarily getting a pay increase,” Burtless said.

Some businesses are offering hazard pay, but it’s being handled on a case-by-case basis. There are some proposals in Congress to include hazard pay for essential workers in upcoming legislation, but it’s not clear any of those proposals will become law.

Many essential workers are stuck. Some of them would rather not work and put their health at risk, but generally, people who leave their jobs voluntarily aren’t eligible to collect unemployment. They can quit and apply, but there are no guarantees they’ll be able to collect benefits.

Kristi, a Family Dollar worker in Georgia, told me she normally makes $10.50 an hour but has now had her pay temporarily bumped up to $12.50 an hour by the company. She’s aware that unemployment would be a more lucrative and safer option, but she’s worried if she quits and applies, she won’t be approved.

“If I say, look, I want to be at home with my family, then, okay well you lost your job and you can’t collect unemployment,” she said. “I was looking into that, if there’s some loophole where I can say, look, I’m terrified to do this, and I don’t want to be exposed to these people that aren’t following the rules, that don’t take it seriously, for $12.50 an hour.”

Others are taking the chance. Eva Coyle was working part-time at a local grocery store in North Carolina when the pandemic hit and grew increasingly concerned about her safety. When her store offered a leave of absence, she took it, opting to “throw myself at the mercy” of the social safety net. She’s over 65 and collects Social Security and is on Medicare, and she’s applied for food stamps and unemployment.

“You get to a certain age, and I’m not somebody who’s looking for a career anymore or a full-time job, but I can’t live on Social Security, so I have to continue to work and I’m not quite sure what the future holds for me,” she said. “I have no savings, so I’m in the boat with so many other Americans, really no backup.”

As some state economies open back up, unemployment benefits are going to be a big part of the conversation

Thus far, essential workers have largely been the ones experiencing this scenario of having to work when they’d rather stay home and collect unemployment, but as states begin reopening their economies, it’s something more Americans will face.

Georgia began to lift some restrictions and allow some businesses to reopen on Friday. Colorado is starting to do the same. That means people are being recalled to work.

Some people would, understandably, rather stay home instead of going back on the job, but it’s not clear they’ll be able to collect unemployment. As a Reuters article recently noted, people who are afraid of getting the coronavirus when going back to work may not get unemployment benefits. Being too scared to work isn’t a qualifier.

Jess Clark, a self-employed tattoo artist in Georgia, would rather continue to social distance but instead is going to have to go back to work. She’s been out of work for six weeks and because of delays in the system was never able to collect benefits at all. “Many of us are being forced to go back to work because we no longer are eligible for the unemployment benefit many of us have yet to receive,” Clark said in an email.

A benefits system with weeks upon weeks of delays where many people never are able to collect at all isn’t too generous, it’s not generous enough.

As people are asked to go back to work, there certainly will be some who try to make a calculation as to whether they can continue to stay home and stay safe instead of putting their health at risk. Or people might look for different types of jobs. But it’s going to be difficult to tease out what is driving decisions. “To the degree that there are vacancies, how much of this is really explained by the fear of coronavirus, which is legitimate?” Hardy said.

The last recession is also fresh in many workers’ memories, including how hard it was to find a job for many people. Staying at home and collecting unemployment benefits set to expire in a few months isn’t a risk-free calculation.

“You might be quite legitimately fearful that if you turn down the job from which you’ve been furloughed, it may take you a very, very long time to find another job that pays the bills,” Burtless said. “And that is a reasonable fear based on what we just went through from 2008 to 2015 or so. Those spells of unemployment were extremely long.”",vox,https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-us-response-trump/2020/4/28/21238458/unemployment-insurance-expanded-essential-workers-lindsey-graham
"['Dylan Scott', 'Apr', 'With Every Doctor S Office That Closes', 'Or Every Physician Who Gets Bought Out A Bigger Company', 'Health Care Access In The Us Will Only Get Worse. America Already Has Fewer Doctors', 'Nurses Per Capita Than Other Wealthy Countries.']",2020-04-27,Coronavirus has created a crisis for primary care doctors and their patients,"The coronavirus pandemic is creating yet another kind of health care crisis: America’s primary care practices are struggling financially as patient visits plummet, and patients themselves are missing out on vital routine care.

Doctors and other health care providers have seen a precipitous drop in the routine visits they depend on for revenue, and experts fear many offices will have to close. Meanwhile, patients with chronic conditions are facing hardships because they can’t see their regular physician to get routine care.

“That really creates a problem for those of us with chronic illnesses,” says Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown’s Health Policy Institute. “Is maintaining your health … urgent care? Not something we usually put in the box of ‘urgent,’ but if we don’t take care of it, it’s going to get urgent or emergent.”

Palanker knows this because she is a patient herself. I talked to her while she was driving to Philadelphia from the Washington, DC, area to get a nerve block treatment for her chronic pain caused by a rare autoimmune disorder. Her regular clinic had stopped all outpatient services because of Covid-19.

For Palanker, and many other patients like her, her chronic condition is not something that can be put off. “I feel very intense pain pretty much everywhere in my body,” she says. “Yeah, it’s not life or death, but it’s not just quality of life. There’s pain that impedes on your quality of life and there’s pain that impedes your life.”

“I’m not able to play with my daughter in the way that I would like to. I don’t have the energy and I’m usually in too much pain to run around.”

Palanker was able to travel to Philadelphia for the treatment, but plenty of other people don’t have that flexibility. This likely won’t be a short-lived crisis, either. Primary care visits have dropped by nearly 50 percent during the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, according to a new study from Harvard researchers; some specialists have seen even steeper declines. Independent physician practices might soon have no choice but to close or allow themselves to be bought out by insurance companies or a larger health system.

“I think many primary care practices are in critical condition because I don’t think they can survive much longer in the business model they’re currently in,” Bob Doherty, senior vice president of governmental affairs and public policy for the American College of Physicians, told me.

The stimulus bills passed by Congress have provided some relief, but it might not be enough. “The real worry is [if] eight weeks from now, hundreds of primary care physicians are shuttering their practices,” Doherty said.

Covid-19 has exposed many weaknesses in American life, including the vulnerabilities of the US health care system. In a nation that already trailed other rich countries in access to health care, America’s primary care is imperiled by this pandemic — now and in the future.

Doctor visits have fallen steeply during the coronavirus pandemic

Dr. Bill Fox has been part of a small independent primary care practice in Charlottesville, Virginia, for nearly 20 years. He says he’s never experienced anything like he and his two partners are seeing now.

Their office is seeing half as many patients as they usually would, and the vast majority of their appointments are now being done by phone or video call. Revenues are way down.

“This is a completely unprecedented event I don’t think any of us could have imagined,” Fox told me. “I think even for those people who understood that pandemics could occur, I don’t think anyone gave thought to what that would mean to being a physician in a small independent practice.”

New data shows Fox and his colleagues are not alone. Researchers from Harvard University collaborated with Phreesia, a health care technology firm that works with more than 50,000 providers nationwide on patient registration and other administrative tasks, to measure the size of the coronavirus impact.

Their findings, published by the Commonwealth Fund, suggest an unparalleled crisis: Overall outpatient visits plummeted nearly 60 percent from the first week of March to the last. The numbers have stayed low through mid-April.

“Within my lifetime, I have not seen anything of this magnitude,” Ateev Mehrotra, a professor at Harvard Medical School who led the study, told me.

He also said that “our real concern is those patients who might have deferred a visit and they’re going to have a flare-up of their chronic illness.” In a worst-case scenario, that could lead to patients dying at home — a person with heart failure, for example — who might not have if they’d been able to see their regular doctor. This will add to the death toll of Covid-19, but it will be hard to fully measure.

According to the study, some specialties have been hit harder than others. People have almost entirely stopped going to ophthalmologists for eye checkups and treatments (visits are down 79 percent). Dermatology (down 73 percent), urology (63 percent), and cardiology (61 percent) visits are also experiencing some of the sharpest declines. So are pediatric practices, where visits are down more than 60 percent.

But it’s all relative. The ostensibly less affected fields have still endured dramatic drops in their business. Adult primary care visits have fallen by 49 percent. OB-GYN clinics are seeing half as many patients as usual. Even oncologists, who treat cancer patients, have seen their business cut almost in half during the coronavirus outbreak.

Increased telehealth visits have offset some, but not most, of those losses. Medicare and private insurers have increased eligibility and reimbursement for those virtual visits, to both allow patients to consult with their physicians and help doctors recoup some of their losses from in-person visits. But even this surge in phone and video consultations, which accounted for a small percentage of all visits in early March and are up to nearly 30 percent of all visits now, has made only a small dent in the losses doctors are experiencing.

Doctors can only do so much over telehealth, too. Certain prescriptions can require an in-person consultation. And physicians often won’t accept new patients over phone or video calls.

Palanker says she worries about people recently diagnosed with diabetes or heart disease who won’t be able to get that critical first appointment with a new doctor. “You can’t delay those appointments for a few months,” she says.

Independent practices are the most at risk of closing or being bought out

The threat to independent practices is a matter of simple economics: They do not have the same amount of capital or reserve funds to fall back on that hospitals and large systems do. It’s the same reason that solitary rural hospitals are more threatened during the coronavirus crisis than academic institutions or systems composed of several facilities.

America’s doctors have gradually been shifting from independent practitioners to employees of larger health systems, often owned by hospitals, over the decades. In 2018, the number of doctors who were employed by a health system narrowly surpassed, for the first time, those who owned their own practice, the culmination of that long-running trend.

Experts expect the toll of the coronavirus pandemic to cause even more consolidation. The only other option might be to go out of business.

“What happens to the structure of primary care? I fear you could end up with a very different-looking structure, with many [practices] shuttered. Many of them could be bought by insurance companies,” said Andy Slavitt, who oversaw Medicare and Medicaid during the Obama administration. “I could see a real decimating of independent primary care, and specialists impacted as well.”

The funding provided by the CARES Act will help, but it only goes so far. Doherty told me the first payout from the emergency fund set up by that legislation probably covers a couple of weeks of lost revenue for most practices. Federal assistance could run out before business returns to normal.

“I could see a real decimating of independent primary care, and specialists impacted as well”

Fox, the Charlottesville physician, told me that if he and his partners continue to see the volume of patients they’re seeing right now, they could probably pay most of their overhead but wouldn’t be able to afford to pay themselves a salary.

The Paycheck Protection Program should help them for a couple of months. But beyond that, the future is uncertain. Fox said he and his partners haven’t started planning for what they’ll do if they can’t afford to keep the practice open, but with all of them in the middle of their careers, retiring isn’t an option. They’ll have to find a way to work.

“Physicians who go into independent practice and stay there for as long as we have believe in the ethos of independent practice,” he said. “But we all recognize in the back of our minds, there’s a possibility we might not make it through this disruption to our practice.”

Telehealth visits are expected to stay up, but Doherty worries patients will be reluctant to visit a doctor’s office anytime soon unless absolutely necessary.

“Under almost any circumstances, practices are not bringing back the volume of in-person visits anytime soon,” he says. “It just becomes a simple question of math. They’ve gotta pay payrolls, and they don’t have the revenue to support it.”

That leaves closures, retirement, or mergers as options. Palanker told me her greatest fear for herself is that her neurologist, whom she’s seen for nearly a decade, will decide to retire because of the economic shock of the pandemic.

“He’s gotta be hemorrhaging money right now,” she said. “I keep waiting for that email that he’s retiring.”

US health care access could get even worse

With every doctor’s office that closes, or every physician who gets bought out by a bigger company, health care access in the US will only get worse. America already has fewer doctors and nurses per capita than other wealthy countries.

And those losses are likely to be disproportionately felt in rural America (80 percent of which was already found to be medically underserved, according to 2019 federal estimates) and by black or Latino patients, who have historically had less access to primary care than white Americans.

Even if physicians survive by joining a larger system, that might not mitigate all the damage to health care access. Doctors could be asked to move as a result of their mergers, Palanker told me, drawing them farther away from their patients.

“The aftershocks on primary care will be huge. I’m terrified what we’ll see is left of our independent practices,” she says. “I fear a lot of provider deserts are going to be worsened.”

And then there is the problem of prices.

Health care concentration of any kind, whether hospitals merging with one another or primary care and specialty practices merging into hospital systems, has been found to drive up health care costs.

Brent Fulton, an adjunct professor at the University of California Berkeley, summarized the existing research in Health Affairs in 2017:

Overall, these studies have found that higher concentration was associated with higher physician prices across a range of services, including three types of commonly billed office visits, office visits across ten prominent specialties, orthopedics, cardiology and orthopedics, and common outpatient procedures.

Already, doctors in the US are far more likely to say their patients have cost-related access problems (33 percent) than physicians in other wealthy countries (the average was 13 percent across 10 other wealthy nations, per a 2016 Commonwealth Fund survey). One in three Americans said last year they had skipped medical treatment because of the cost.

Now millions more Americans are uninsured because they lost their jobs during the coronavirus recession, and, when the dust settles, the physician market will probably be more concentrated. That will drive medical prices, and therefore insurance premiums, even higher. Out-of-pocket costs could rise, as insurers shift more of those excess costs to their customers. It will be that much harder for many Americans to access and afford health care.

The US could have made policy changes that would have prevented such a deleterious impact on doctors just because in-person visits are down. Right now, many primary care doctors are paid on a fee-for-service basis, which means they bill insurers and patients for every visit and service. So when those numbers drop off, so does revenue.

There are other ways to pay doctors. Many other developed countries use global budgeting, which sets the income for hospitals and doctors at the beginning of the year based on the services they are expected to provide. There are other variations, but the core principle — doctors can expect a set amount of income and don’t have to tally up visits and services to make their revenue goals — is largely the same.

But, as Doherty put it, changing how American doctors get paid would be “a very long bridge to get across.” A crisis like the coronavirus could lead to such fundamental changes to US health care — but the odds are against it. The history of US health reform is generally one of more marginal changes, with many of the more ambitious plans falling short.

Instead, Doherty is worrying about two or three months from now, when doctors might decide they have no choice but to shut down their practice. His thoughts drifted to chronic care patients like Palanker, who depend on having easy access to their doctor to manage their conditions.

"['Ezra Klein', 'Apr']",2020-04-27,Bill Gates’s vision for life beyond the coronavirus,"Evidence-based explanations of the coronavirus crisis, from how it started to how it might end to how to protect yourself and others.

In 2015, I asked Bill Gates a simple question: What are you most afraid of?

He replied by telling me about the death chart of the 20th century. There’s the spike for World War I. The spike for World War II. But between them sat a spike as big as World War II. That, he said, was the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 65 million people. Gates’s greatest fear was a flu like that, ripping through our hyperglobalized world.

Gates had funded modeling that imagined precisely that scenario. Within days, it would be in all urban centers around the world. Within months, tens of millions could die.

Bill Gates saw this coming, and he tried to warn the world. He did TED talks and media interviews. He published in medical journals. He made policy proposals and spent millions on vaccine research. And he failed. The virus came, and we weren’t ready. Now we all live in the aftermath of Gates’s nightmare.

Gates has reoriented his foundation and committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the world’s fight against the coronavirus. He recently published a long essay detailing what we know and don’t know about the virus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, and what we need to invent and deploy to safely return to normalcy.

I spoke with Gates on Friday to explore those questions, plus a few more. What does it feel like to be at the center of so many coronavirus conspiracy theories? What happens if we reopen too soon? Why are different cities seeing such different outcomes? Do rich and poor countries need different responses? What are the true chances of a vaccine in 18 months?

But above all, I wanted to ask him the inverse of the question I asked him in 2015: What does he hope for? What is his vision for life after the coronavirus?

You can listen to our full conversation by subscribing to The Ezra Klein Show wherever you get your podcasts. A transcript of my discussion with Gates, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows.

Ezra Klein

On February 28, you wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that Covid-19 “has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we’ve been worried about.” Two months have passed since then. Has what we’ve learned since then made you more or less worried?

Bill Gates

Sadly, the disease got into exponential growth in a lot of Europe and the United States. So the toll there is greater than I would have expected. We’re still learning about how to do testing. In the US, even the numbers overstate where we are because we’re not prioritizing the right people, we’re not getting results back in a timely fashion. So it’s been a mixed bag. The fact that social isolation really knocks the numbers down — that’s good news. But, of course, that comes at an incredible price.

Ezra Klein

When we spoke in 2015, you talked about a model you ran that found that a 1918-like influenza could kill 33 million people worldwide in six months. We don’t look to be hitting that death toll. Do you think that’s because this is not as deadly or contagious as what we saw in 1918, or because we as a global community are doing a better job of responding than the models might have predicted?

Bill Gates

We don’t really know what’s going to happen in developing countries, where most of the world’s population lives. The actual reported cases out of those countries are pretty small to date. But unless there’s some magical factor, the likelihood that the vast majority of the deaths will be there is very high. It’s harder for them to socially isolate and to do what we’ve done. So I think it’s premature to predict the eventual death toll.

Ezra Klein

Let’s talk about the developing world picture for a moment. A month ago, my reporting had me worried that Brazil was about to be a disaster; that South Africa, with its heavily immunocompromised population, would be a disaster; that India would be in terrible shape. So far, it’s not been as bad as I think a lot of people worried it would be. Why do you think that is?

Bill Gates

That, to me, is the most mysterious thing. I hope there’s some reasons other than that they’re just not testing enough people and people are afraid to seek out testing, or that the people who do world travel are separated from the bulk of the population, so diffusion to a worker that lives in the slum may have taken an extra month or two.

They do have a better age structure, but they have more air pollution, lots of HIV, lots of malnutrition — which are associated with very bad outcomes. There’s one city in Ecuador that’s experiencing exponential growth. And, so I’m looking up, do they have a subway in Guayaquil?

You know, New York and London are even worse than pure density measures, or even the international travel would predict. What activities lead to these super-spreading events?

Ezra Klein

This is the tricky part, to me. The pieces don’t quite fit together. Why does New York City look the way it does, but San Francisco has kept this under control? And if the answer is just early social distancing, why doesn’t Florida, which closed much later and had very poor political leadership and has a much older population, look worse? It’s the same with some of the developing countries. It feels to me like there are variables here that we are not seeing or we are not measuring correctly.

“We don’t really know what’s going to happen in developing countries, where most of the world’s population lives”

Bill Gates

The flu, which has been around for a long time, kills on average 40,000 people every year. And the amount we don’t know about the flu is amazing. We don’t understand why the flu is seasonal. It’s such a profound thing that there’s this three-month period where it’s very active and then almost nine months where you have a hard time finding it, depending on which hemisphere you’re in.

Infectious disease hasn’t gotten the depth of [attention] that, say, cancer or heart disease has, because it’s largely gone from the rich countries that drive scientific priorities. That’s a big part of what our foundation does: to work on the things that kill the most people, including the remaining infectious disease burden. So it’s not that stunning to me. This is a very novel syndrome that we’re facing here.

Ezra Klein

One thing I appreciate about your paper is that you have a section about what we don’t know. What are the big things you wish we knew that we simply don’t?

Bill Gates

The seasonality and weather effects. It’s looking more and more like indoor infection is a dramatic part of the infection, and that the way our circulation works in closed spaces like subways really works against you.

Are asymptomatics just slightly being exposed and therefore not in the chain of infection very much? The best study on that in Singapore shows about 6 percent [of cases came from asymptomatic transfer]. But other people have done the studies different ways that give, I think, unrealistically high numbers.

We don’t know enough about the human immune response yet. That’s very important, because if it’s a very weak response, then you’re not protected from a second infection. I don’t think that’s likely. Until we actually are looking at this blood plasma to see what the titers of the antibodies are, not this binary serology thing that’s not helpful, we’re very much in uncharted territory.

Ezra Klein

To go back to what you just said about the binary serological tests. We’ve seen some of these in Santa Clara and LA counties. For those not familiar with this debate, what they found is a much higher prevalence of the disease and a much lower lethality rate. Why do you think those studies aren’t reliable or helpful?

Bill Gates

The false positive rate on that serology test is very, very high. It’s just the way the statistics work. When you have 98 percent who certainly aren’t infected, false positives completely overwhelm the real data. So that study would say there’s like 10 times as many people who’ve been exposed as who’ve shown symptoms. Most other things — like Diamond Princess, Singapore, where you go through the viral loads — showed more like two to three times.

That will get resolved. We have quantitative serological tests that are being applied at the population level in about five different countries, including some work that I’m sponsoring. So we’ll get to the bottom of that. You know, it would be better if more people have been exposed, if that’s associated with immunity, but that’s also unknown.

Ezra Klein

I was looking back at a paper you published in 2015 about preparing for pandemics. And the point you made there that was telling: We are constantly rehearsing for war against an enemy of another country. We’re constantly rehearsing as part of NATO or US military war games.

Pandemics are a well-known thing, they’ve happened throughout history. We knew one was going to come eventually. And we were not doing these pre-rehearsals. Why do you think it is that we are so much more focused on threats from each other than threats that come from nature?

Bill Gates

I think part of it is that the minor epidemics we had really didn’t hit the US. If you look at the Asian countries that did well, many of them wrote down: step one, identify all PCR machines. [Polymerase chain reaction machines, used by laboratories to copy small segments of DNA.] Step two: get supplies for PCR machines. We haven’t done that in a reasonable way today, even though we have more machines per capita than anybody else.

Places like Taiwan or South Korea, because they were hit with MERS or SARS, had the playbook. They opened the playbook, they went through those steps, and it’s saved them 10 percent of GDP and immense human suffering that they took respiratory disease in a serious way.

The fact that [a novel infectious disease] hasn’t been in this country for so long allowed us to not think about it as a priority. I wish I’d been more successful in getting these investments made in advance. I think back: How could I have been louder, more articulate? Very little was done.

Ezra Klein

In the essay you wrote on April 23, you argued that we don’t just need policy to reopen — there are innovations we need but don’t yet have. What are some of the innovations that we need?

Bill Gates

There are three categories. There’s scaling up testing, which if you had a miraculous level of, you might want to test everyone before they went on a cruise ship or went into a theme park or came to work in a warehouse. We’re a factor of a thousand away from that. And we can’t let the finite capacity go to that because we have higher priorities. So testing is the first big category. I’d put contact tracing into that as well because it’s all one regime for reducing infection.

Then you have the therapies or drugs. And then finally you have the vaccine. So those are the three buckets.

Ezra Klein

Let’s start then with testing. There have been reported shortages of things like reagents and swabs. There’s been a lack of focus. But in your view, what is between us and the kind of testing regime you wish we had?

Bill Gates

We’re showing the FDA that basically any swab works. You can swab yourself, put it in a plastic bag, and send it back, as long as it gets to the machine in a reasonable time frame. So the swabbing thing shouldn’t be a limiting factor.

In terms of the actual machines, there are ways of running them that can make it faster. We’re exploring those. But the machines still aren’t being used effectively. Even today, we’re not enumerating which ones still have idle capacity and making sure that the right things are fed into that. And is this a federal thing? Some states have a lot of PCR machines. Some states have very few. They briefly involved FEMA, but they didn’t have the background for this.

Ezra Klein

I heard you give an interview with TED a month ago, where you said the same thing on swabs: that your foundation has shown the FDA that swabbing the tip of the nose was as sensitive as the more intrusive test. You’re making the same point today. So are regulators moving fast enough right now? And if not, is there some other process we need to be spinning up given it’s an emergency?

Bill Gates

There’s definitely progress. It’s moving at a much higher speed than it would absent a crisis. The pieces are coming into place to avoid the swab front end being a limiting factor. That’s a likely thing to happen in the next couple of months.

Ezra Klein

Let’s go to the next group of innovations. Are there medications short of vaccines right now that you think are promising and that we can have in a quicker time than the vaccines?

Bill Gates

Absolutely. A therapeutic is easier. If your therapeutic has a dramatic benefit, you know, you can see that with just 100 patients. So you can go through a large number at a time. This is happening right now — we have studies going on. The UK is doing a good job on this. Germany is doing a good job.

There are particular compounds — and not necessarily the ones that get mentioned — that look very promising. There’s one where you look in the blood of recovered patients and find the best antibodies. And then you either directly use that blood or you manufacture that antibody. That one has got quite a bit of promise. So we’re orchestrating, who’s got the best antibodies? Who has that manufacturing capacity? And trying to get that up and going well before the end of the year.

“I don’t think the coronavirus will prove to be an impossible target but I can’t guarantee it”

Ezra Klein

Given what we just talked about, how much do you think the limiting factor here is going to be manufacturing supply chain capacity six months from now?

Bill Gates

For some of these vaccine constructs, it’s hard to scale up the manufacturing, partly because they are novel or just because the chemistry is very complex. And you’re in a new regime when you talk about making billions of a vaccine. We don’t make billions of any vaccine. We make hundreds of millions, but for those, we’ve had decades to work on their efficiency.

Even the fill finish at the very end where you put it in a glass bottle, that’s a special pharmaceutical-grade glass — the world doesn’t have enough of that. So we’re working to get that underway because all the vaccine approaches need to be put into a bottle at some point in time. I hope we get to the point where it’s the manufacturing piece because those investments are at most billions to save trillions.

Ezra Klein

Let me ask a dumb question about vaccines. I see a fair amount of confidence that there will be a vaccine in, say, 18 months. And yet, we’ve not got an HIV-AIDS vaccine. There are a lot of coronaviruses that we’ve wanted vaccines against forever. How likely is it that in two years, 3 billion people have been vaccinated for this effectively?

Bill Gates

Very likely.

Ezra Klein

Why?

Bill Gates

This target is not as difficult as HIV. That is — the spike protein isn’t changing its shape like it is with HIV. And for SARS, we actually did get a vaccine. Then the disease was gone. And so we never did a phase three trial. We even have an antiviral for Ebola.

So I don’t think the coronavirus will prove to be an impossible target but I can’t guarantee it. Even now, we’re starting to see animal data. So by the end of the summer it will be pretty clear. And I think at least some of the top 10 constructs will look very promising.

Ezra Klein

Tell me a bit about your project to set up different vaccine manufacturing platforms in advance, knowing that we’re not yet sure which kind of facility we’re going to need.

Bill Gates

Well, [the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations] is the group we created to do a lot of this work. We’ve been directly funding these people. Some of them have new RNA approaches and one has a DNA approach. These new approaches have certain advantages, but you don’t want to totally bet on them because you’ve never actually made a vaccine that way before. So if you look at the risk level, it’s probably the more classic subunit vaccines, even though they get started a little bit later. Understanding the mechanisms and the manufacturing is straightforward for those.

Ezra Klein

Talk to me about some of these new approaches. What makes them different and what could make them better?

Bill Gates

Usually what you do is you put a part of the shape of the virus in, and then the immune system sees that, realizes it’s a foreign thing, and decides it should be ready immediately to make antibodies if it ever sees this again. So usually you’re injecting at least part of the shape of the virus. Sometimes you do the whole virus, but it’s attenuated so it doesn’t multiply too much. Sometimes you take the virus and you kill it and stick it in.

Most of the new vaccines are subunit vaccines, where you don’t put the whole virus in. You just put a little piece of it — like the spike protein in the case of coronavirus. Instead of putting the whole shape in, what you do is you put in the code, the instructions to make that shape. What you have to manufacture is just RNA, which is trivial because it’s just these known codes that you string together.

That’s why it’s a promising approach that these new companies are taking: If it works, it will be the platform for quick response in future pandemics.

Ezra Klein

If we had been heavily investing in vaccine production capacity over the past five or 10 years, do you think we’d be in a different place today?

Bill Gates

Oh, absolutely. We would be able to do this in a year.

There are a number of things that you have to practice to understand: Who should step up and make the decisions? Where do we pool this money? How are the regulators going to make the tradeoff of getting it out quickly versus having a big safety database?

There’s a political instinct of people to look good or not look bad. The crisis is a tough time to think through all the pieces that are necessary. It’s nice to not have that breathing down on you as you make these scientific decisions.

Ezra Klein

Are there regulatory approaches we could do that would make this move much faster? People talk, for instance, about “human challenge trials” — does any of that seem possible to you?

Bill Gates

It’s up to regulators to decide. Mostly when you have a serious disease like this, it’s unethical to use human challenge trials. So I don’t think that will be used here. On paper, yes, that gives you a quicker way to see if your vaccine is effective so you could shorten the schedule. But who are those volunteers? Are they fully informed? For malaria that’s allowed because we have drugs that are entirely curative. But for TB, HIV, it’s not allowed. And unless there was some breakthrough innovation, it shouldn’t be allowed.

Ezra Klein

Right now in the US, we have not filled the testing and contact tracing structure or innovations, much less these secondary therapeutic or vaccine innovations. And yet a number of states are moving toward reopening. How worried are you about significant second spike problems?

Bill Gates

I’m super worried about it. Unless they’re very gradual and pick the things that we know don’t raise the rate of infection over one, then you’re going to have this heterogeneity where parts of the US will be doing well and other parts will be doing poorly. The temptation to interdict travel between those parts will be very difficult.

Without the testing, [reopening] is really a blind thing. I hate to be a broken record on this, but, where’s the testing prioritization? For most places, in late May, early June, we’ll have the case numbers down. So if you use that time to fix the testing, get the contact tracing going, then opening up will make sense. And that shouldn’t be some political thing. It should be a scientific thing.

Ezra Klein

You’ve mentioned a couple of times the problem of testing prioritization, which I think is an issue people are less familiar with. Can you talk about what it should be versus what it is?

Bill Gates

Some people have access to testing who have no symptoms, and some people with symptoms have no access to testing. So a substantial percentage of the testing is not helpful. It’s almost corrupt in the sense that if you have a close relationship with your doctor in a hospital, you’ll get onto their PCR machine no matter what your circumstances are. And if you don’t have that type of connection, even if you’re a health care worker, you can get tests back five days later. So it’s a hard one to understand why people aren’t outraged about this.

Ezra Klein

As a technologist, what do you think about these contract tracing ideas to do massive scale digital surveillance, using phones and Bluetooth to enforce quarantine using digital information?

Bill Gates

It’s complex to characterize those. Some are more like a memory aid to remind you where you’ve been. So if you get called up for an interview, you can think through: yeah, I did go to that shop, and that shop. That can be helpful.

If you just use Bluetooth, the distance is too large, so the false positives will just be overwhelming. It’d be hundreds per person in many cases. Some people are going further and using an ultrasonic sound to see which phones are nearby. But even that’s not perfect because a lot of the infections occur in a place where a virus particle was left on a surface. One person leaves with their phone; somebody else comes up an hour or two later and touches that virus and gets infected. There’s no telephone proximity there.

But the German approach, which does require manpower, can work very well. As long as that database is managed properly, it doesn’t jam the privacy issue quite the way that some of the Asian approaches do.

Ezra Klein

In 2015, I asked you what you’re afraid of, and you told me a lethal, pandemic respiratory flu. We’re living through that nightmare now. So let me ask you the reverse of it. Thinking three or five years into the future beyond just the vaccine. What do you hope for?

Bill Gates

I hope that this draws the world together. After World War II, we created new institutions and we successfully avoided having another world war. That’s a phenomenal thing. We haven’t blown off a nuclear weapon as part of a conflict. And we did that by binding ourselves together through a variety of institutions — including the WHO on health. So as bad as that was, the outcome was positive.

This is a tragic event. Whatever good comes out of this will in no way make up for the problems that it causes. But it should say to us, this science is important — let’s use it to avoid pandemics. We’re not going to be out of this until we get rid of it from the entire world. Interdicting travel is a very brute force measure that has lots of negative effects. Even if we have to do that temporarily, it’s not where we want to be.

Everybody brings to the epidemic their hopes that they had before. And I’ve always believed in global cooperation. You can accuse me of just saying, “Everybody’s going to be convinced of my thing.” But I really do believe that the World War II analogy applies here.

Ezra Klein

But there’s a darker version of that, too. People could take the lesson that we’re too interconnected, that our borders are too open, there’s too much immigration. We’ve already seen Donald Trump trying to shut down green cards. Do you worry about this leading to a pulling back from global cooperation?

Bill Gates

In the case of World War II, we know that Germany and Japan had something to do with causing the war. In that case, it wasn’t just some bat somewhere that some guy ate.

You could have said then that it would permanently change attitudes toward people from Japan or Germany — and during the course of the war, we did horrible things we regret because of that. But that’s gone. My dad was part of the occupation in Japan and he couldn’t believe how friendly and cooperative they were. Very quickly, we helped them build up. They did build up. The sense of mutual benefit was very strong there through those institutions.

We took a much worse situation and crafted it into the institutions and the economic growth and innovation that we’ve had between World War II and now. I hope that this looks like that.

Ezra Klein

In the beginning of your essay you say this is like a world war, but we’re all on the same side. And what is striking to me about this period that we’re in is the effort to create sides. In America, there’s the effort to increase blame toward China — trying to get the UN to call Covid-19 the “Wuhan virus.” And China has responded in kind.

This is something where obviously there needs to be not just global public health cooperation but economic cooperation to get out of it. And yet, there are leaders who see short-term gain in the kind of enmity that’s going to make it harder for them to get their country out of the problem.

Bill Gates

I think in the end the US will show up in a strong way, even though it certainly hasn’t to date. The US Congress has been the most generous on HIV funding for the entire world. It’s been one of the most generous to GAVI in terms of funding vaccines. The US government has helped the health of the entire world. It’s been a huge part of the reduction in death.

In this case, not only is it humanitarian, it’s about strategic relationships and it’s about making sure the disease isn’t coming back into the US as we participate in global commerce that we benefit immensely from. So I think what you’re seeing in the short term, in terms of how the US is engaging, isn’t where we’ll end up. There are many voices that are going to push us to work with Europe and work with other countries and be part of the innovations that will bring this to an end.

Ezra Klein

The US has talked about pulling back funding from the World Health Organization. There are people, I think rightly, disappointed in parts of the WHO’s response. How should we think about the World Health Organization? Why would it be important going forward to continue funding?

Bill Gates

There’s a big fire. The fire department was 20 minutes late. This is like saying, “Let’s fire all the firemen.” Yes, we should do a postmortem. But many people didn’t respond as quickly as they should have. This is not the time to start shifting blame.

The World Health Organization is what helps all countries understand what’s going on with epidemics. They have a very small budget. In movies they show guys flying around and knocking out bioterrorism. They have no budget for that. Their budget is less than a thousandth of what just the US spends on health care. So people who imagine they should have made a vaccine — that’s not their role at all. They’re just not funded to do it. They’ve done a lot of good things. They’re a necessary institution.

At the end of the day, I don’t think the US will reduce its contributions and fire lots of people from WHO in the middle of a crisis like this. I think that will blow over. At least, that’s my hope.

“I think in the end the US will show up in a strong way, even though it certainly hasn’t to date”

Ezra Klein

We knew a pandemic was going to come eventually, but we didn’t prepare for it. So imagine we take the lesson, societally, that we need to prepare for the other risks out there: What are the other ones we need to be preparing for right now?

Bill Gates

Well, things are tough enough. I don’t want to dwell on bioterrorism, but whatever the fatality rate of this thing is, it’s not anywhere near bioterrorism — smallpox or another pathogen that was intentionally picked for a high fatality rate as well as delayed symptoms and a high infectious rate. Fortunately, what we need to do to be ready for a naturally caused pandemic is a subset of what we need to do to be ready for a bioterrorism-induced pandemic, too.

I’m wondering how much you think about how we operate industrial animal production globally. This likely comes from wet markets in China and there’s been a lot of concern about confined animal feeding operations in other countries. The UN has said the way we raise animals is the weak link of the global public health chain. Do we need to rethink that approach?

Bill Gates

You’re not going to ever drive zoonotic diseases — diseases that cross species barriers — to zero. This will always be a risk and we can prepare for that risk. You can reduce the risk a little bit by having fewer wet markets and less bushmeat, but it’s very hard to regulate in the rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. If you had to say where’s the next one likely to come from, that would be it. That’s very dangerous.

Ezra Klein

Do you think there’s a different trade-off that should be made between social distancing and keeping economies going in those countries compared to the richer countries?

Bill Gates

Absolutely. If you push so hard that people don’t have access to food, you’re going to create civil unrest. That’s the opposite of social distancing. In these developing countries, nuanced policies are much harder to implement because your capacity is just lower. I think we need a lot of innovation to make policies that are appropriate for developing countries. And right now, they’re largely trying to do what worked in rich countries.

Ezra Klein

There has been a rise of conspiracy theories around you: that, because you were predicting something like coronavirus, perhaps you created it, to profit off it, or to use a vaccine to control people. So why did you create the coronavirus and what is it like to be at the center of that kind of conspiracy theory?

Bill Gates

It’s kind of sad, really. Who would have thought that Lysol would have to remind people not to inject disinfectant in their body? Some people actually act on these things. Misinformation is dangerous, particularly in this type of crisis where people’s willingness to believe wild things is heightened.

We’re all in a very tough situation — me less than others, but broadly. So somebody says we should blame this country or that person, who’s different than us. That is dangerous stuff. And so I’m sorry to see that getting going. I don’t think it’s that widespread, but I hope it’ll die out.

Ezra Klein

Something that has struck me throughout this entire calamity is just how much any effective response relies on social trust and solidarity. We seem to be in a moment where our ability to break down the trust people have in institutions outpaces our ability to raise it.

I’m curious if you have any reflections on that.

Bill Gates

If you look at trust figures for most politicians, they’re up pretty dramatically. Where politicians are willing to admit what they don’t know and show that they’re trying to do their best by bringing in experts, I think it’s great that the trust levels are up.

Compliance on the social distancing has been very high. Over time, people’s patience will wear thin, particularly if they’re getting a confusing message from their leadership. But overall, you’d have to feel pretty good about the attitude in the country. If you said to me, we were going to shut all this stuff down, I’d have predicted more of a backlash.

People understand death and survival. Most of the questions that are being asked are very fair questions. Sadly, the topics are complex enough that getting across what we know and what we don’t know is fairly hard. That’s why I made the effort to write the memo. And, a month or two from now, I’ll know more, and maybe I’ll write again.

"['Daniel Markus', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,Could contact tracing bring the US out of lockdown?,"South Korea and the United States reported their first cases of Covid-19 on the same day. Yet while most Americans remain under stay-at-home orders, many in South Korea are doing what seems unthinkable in the US — returning to their offices.

South Korea has often been touted as rolling out one of the best national responses to the coronavirus, and the country’s approach has been comprehensive. All passengers that arrive at Incheon Airport — South Korea’s hub for international flights — receive mandatory temperature checks and must download the country’s coronavirus app, where they report any changes in their symptoms (or lack thereof) every single day.

This app is an important part of South Korea’s effort at contact tracing: the effort to find and notify every person who comes in contact with someone who tests positive for Covid-19. And a few weeks ago, Apple and Google announced that they were developing software that would enable contact tracing apps in the US. How might this technology change the trajectory of the US coronavirus crisis?

In this episode of Reset, host Arielle Duhaime-Ross talks with Stat News reporter Sharon Begley about how digital contact tracing is our best hope of emerging from lockdown, and why we didn’t start working on it sooner.

A lightly edited transcript of their conversation follows.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

There are a lot of ways in which the US has been sort of playing catch-up in its response to the pandemic. Is that the case with contact tracing?

Sharon Begley

It is the case with contact tracing for the basic reason that experts in contact tracing, and also in infectious disease, have forever believed and argued that contact tracing does not work with a respiratory disease. And the reason experts told us that contact tracing would not work with respiratory diseases is that respiratory diseases spread too easily — air is a lot easier to come into contact with than someone else’s blood — and that they also spread too quickly. So from the get-go, this country has not even attempted to do serious contact tracing. We didn’t try it in the first cases in the state of Washington. We didn’t try it after cases appeared in California, [we] certainly have not tried it since cases appeared on the East Coast. And in addition, contact tracing is immensely laborious. You need an army of thousands of people to do it.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

But right now, contact tracing is being touted as one of the ways that we’ll eventually be able to sort of reopen the country. Why are we seeing this shift in the way that people are talking about this?

Sharon Begley

Because of what happened in other countries. In South Korea, in particular, in Singapore, both of which had very, very early cases, not surprising given their proximity to China, that’s what they did. Those countries did contact tracing. It worked. And suddenly that opened the eyes of experts who said, no, no, it could never be done.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

So wait, does that completely change the way that we look at respiratory illnesses like this?

Sharon Begley

It really does. You know, just as with the recognition that face masks actually can help, all sorts of assumptions about respiratory diseases are being rewritten and, in fact, overturned as a result of what we’re seeing in this pandemic.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Okay, so, in all the plans that we are seeing to reopen the country, to reopen the United States, how important is contact tracing going to be?

Sharon Begley

Everybody who has looked at this — academics, officials in other countries — say that this will be the only way that the country can be reopened, that we can have an exit from the very strict social distancing [and] physical distancing that we’ve had for the last month and a half. You know, whether it’s the governors talking about how to figure this out, testing and contact tracing is at the center of all of those plans. And the sequence is, test, in other words, you have to identify people who carry the virus, trace their contacts, you isolate people, and you hope that works.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

I can’t help but notice that you’re not talking about antibody testing. You’re not talking about vaccines. I guess that’s sort of surprising, probably for a lot of people hearing this, that contact tracing and not these future things that we’re hoping will happen will be central to this approach.

Sharon Begley

You know, the reason I’m not emphasizing vaccines now is because there’s not going to be a vaccine in this calendar year. As far as serology testing, [that is], the blood tests that identify if somebody has antibodies to this coronavirus, that absolutely can play a role in reopening the economy. But, you know, let’s look at the numbers. … The country has some 350 million people. If you’re only going to let go back to life, back to work, people who have survived their Covid-19 infection, that’s not going to give you the numbers that you need. The reason you need testing and contact tracing is that you want a whole lot more people to be able to go back to their stores and their workplaces and their factories and be able to safely ride the subway and all of those things. So it can’t be only the blood tests for the antibodies.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Okay, so what do we need to do to implement a successful contact tracing program for Covid-19, and what are the obstacles?

Sharon Begley

So here’s the problem. As we were saying earlier in the experts’ objection to contact tracing for a respiratory virus, it has to be done fast. On average, to identify a person’s contacts — just to identify them, let alone to track them down — takes something like 12 hours of asking, “Where were you? What were you doing? What was it like there?” So that’s an average.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Twelve hours is a really long time. To be clear, that’s a long interview.

Sharon Begley

That’s a long interview. Probably not sitting in one place for all that time, but going back to the person to say, “Wait, are you sure you weren’t here or there? And what about this block of time when you forgot where you were?” So it’s very time-consuming to do that with just plain old analog human beings. The estimates are that the United States would need at least 100,000 tracers, possibly as many as 300,000. And, of course, we’re going to pay these people and value them and encourage them. So, you know, you’re probably looking at … upwards of 3.6 billion … dollars just to do that. And absolutely, it’s worth it. But that’s the order of magnitude that you’re talking about in terms of effort.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

So it sounds like doing contact tracing with human interviewers will be expensive and time-consuming. And now we’re seeing lots of attempts to automate this process with technology. So in theory, how could technology help?

Sharon Begley

The technology that’s being discussed can be basically instantaneous. The way many of these systems would work is, again, you opt-in. And the opting in means that … you would … get an alert saying, “Yes, you came into close contact with someone. We think you should now isolate yourself for 14 days.” If you can get through those two weeks without symptoms, then that casual passing by the person did not infect you. That can be done virtually, instantaneously — certainly, you know, faster than human contact tracers. And the hope is that by doing it that quickly, you can snuff out any transmission chains that might crop up.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Right, because to be clear, it’s not just reducing the time of that 12-hour interview. It’s also reducing the time that it takes to contact the people that the person has been in touch with by just making it automated and automatic.

Sharon Begley

A group at Oxford university in the UK did model this. And they found that if you can accelerate how quickly you find, you diagnose cases, and trace their contacts, then you can ease up on social distancing to a degree that nothing else will enable you to do.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

So could a tech solution for contact tracing work in the US in a widespread way?

Sharon Begley

So it’s always dicey to talk about a technological fix. But in this case, again, as with so much in Covid-19, we have other countries that have shown us the way. Singapore, South Korea, they used everything from security camera footage to smartphone tracing. Israel rolled out a system like this. What’s important to remember is that success does not mean zero cases. Success means that we do not have another instance where we overwhelm our hospitals and have the horrible situations that we’ve all seen, in especially New York hospitals. Bottom line, you can have way, way less than 100 percent opt-in and still have a really good chance of catching any incipient new infections after we’re over the current wave.

"['Li Zhou', 'Apr']",2020-04-03,How small businesses can get money from the stimulus package,"There’s a significant amount of money — $370 billion — allocated to support small businesses in a new bill that Congress passed this week. These funds are in addition to the $377 billion that lawmakers had previously approved in the CARES Act. Figuring out how to access this money, however, can be somewhat confusing.

Vox is here to help.

The funds in the recent legislation are divided among two small-business programs that offer forgivable grants and loans. (These Small Business Administration programs also apply to nonprofits that meet the necessary size requirements.)

The first of these two programs is the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which enables organizations to obtain up to $10 million in loans that are 100 percent forgivable if they do not lay off any employees or if they rehire employees they’ve already laid off. Seventy-five percent of this money needs to be spent on payroll for the loan to be entirely forgiven.

The second is the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL), which includes a grant that caps out at $10,000. Businesses that receive this do not need to pay it back. The rest of the EIDL loan, which could go up to $2 million, is not forgivable but can be more flexible than PPP in the types of expenses it covers.

Experts tell Vox that it’s possible for businesses and nonprofits to apply to both — and that they should do so fast if they haven’t already. “We encourage you to apply as quickly as you can because there is a funding cap” reads a statement from the Treasury Department. Since both programs have a limited amount of funding, applying sooner is also important in case their allocated funding is fully used, like it was in the first round.

Currently, the EIDL application is accessible here, and can be submitted directly on the SBA website. The PPP application is also live and can be submitted directly with banks, credit unions, and fintech companies including Square and PayPal.

Both the SBA and banks should be able to begin taking new PPP and EIDL applications in the coming days, in the wake of Congress’s approval of these new funds. Businesses that have already applied do not need to apply again and are already in the queue.

This guide is intended to give a broad overview of both programs, but for specific questions, organizations can reach out directly to the Small Business Administration via a 24/7 helpline: 1-800-659-2955. Businesses are also encouraged to connect with advisers at small-business development centers, women’s business centers, and SCORE, who are available to provide free guidance. (Contact information for the closest regional advisers can be found on their websites.)

Let’s start with what’s included in the stimulus

The Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program are the two main options small businesses and nonprofits have to obtain financial support during the coronavirus outbreak. (It’s worth noting that organizations can receive both loans and that an EIDL loan can also be refinanced into a PPP loan.)

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP): The bulk of the small business stimulus funds in the new spending bill, roughly $320 billion, will plus-up the Paycheck Protection Program, a new program created last month under the CARES Act to guarantee businesses the loans they need to cover eight weeks of payroll, along with some utility and rent costs.

If businesses keep employees on payroll or rehire them by June 30 after they’ve been laid off, these loans could be fully forgiven. Businesses are able to request 2.5 times their average monthly payroll costs for this loan. At least 75 percent of the loan must be used to cover payroll costs in order for the entirety of it to be forgiven.

Organizations can apply for PPP by calling their banks and lenders directly. Many of these institutions have online forms that are set up specifically for this program, and online platforms like PayPal and Square can now approve loans, too. As a condition in the new bill, about one-fifth of the new funds are specifically set aside for smaller community-based lenders, including Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which is intended to improve access to these loans.

Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program and Advance (EIDL): There’s $60 billion in the latest stimulus bill allocated for the EIDL, a program that has existed for some time.

This money will go toward two things: It sets up a grant program that would provide an emergency “advance” of as much as $10,000 that businesses won’t have to pay back, and it funds low-interest loans that organizations can use to cover operating expenses, though they will have to repay these funds. The loan amount that organizations can request will be based on the amount of “economic injury” that they have sustained because of the coronavirus.

Businesses and nonprofits can apply for the EIDL directly on the Small Business Administration website.

When do applications open, and when can I expect relief?

Both the EIDL application and the PPP application are now up and running, though there’s still a lot of uncertainty around how long it will take for SBA and banks to process these loans.

Banks have raised concerns about the rushed PPP rollout, and some have limited the loan applications they are receiving to existing customers. Many are warning that the new money that’s been approved by Congress will likely run out quickly, much like the first wave of funding did.

The $10,000 grants that are part of the EIDL program have been viewed as one of the fastest ways for businesses to obtain relief at this point, but this program has also seen overwhelming interest, which could mean delays in how quickly people receive a response about their application. Additionally the amount of the grant is now capped at $1,000 per employee, so any business with less than ten employees would likely not be eligible to receive the full amount.

In the original timeline offered by the agency, if a business is approved for these grants, it would be able to receive them within three days of approval, though businesses have since reported major delays in obtaining status updates.

Any business or nonprofit that applies for an EIDL loan can indicate that it is interested in this emergency advance, and organizations can still receive it even if they aren’t approved for the full loan.

“Businesses applying for EIDL loans are eligible for an emergency advance of up to $10,000 that does not need to be repaid,” Michael Chasalow, the founder of the USC Small Business Clinic, told Vox. “It seems that a business in need of immediate cash should pursue this option.”

Below is what we know so far about how to apply to both programs. We’ll keep updating this guide as more information is released.

First, determine eligibility

The first step for companies and nonprofits interested in these programs is to figure out whether they’re eligible for these specific loans, which are predominantly focused on helping organizations that have suffered economic uncertainty because of the coronavirus outbreak.

In addition to meeting the size standards that are set by the SBA, businesses and nonprofits need to show that they’ve been affected by the coronavirus.

Businesses and nonprofits eligible for the PPP program are required to have been operational on February 15, 2020, and to demonstrate that the economic fallout from the coronavirus has impacted them.

They include:

Any business with 500 or fewer employees

Any 501(c)3 nonprofit that has 500 or fewer employees, or otherwise meets the SBA’s size requirements

Restaurants, hotels, or other businesses categorized under “Accommodation or Food Services” that have 500 or fewer employees at each independent location

Tribal businesses and 501(c)9 veterans organizations

Independently owned franchises

Self-employed workers, independent contractors, gig workers, and sole proprietors

Businesses and nonprofits eligible for the EIDL program are required to have been operational on January 31, 2020, and to have experienced economic uncertainty because of the coronavirus crisis.

They include:

Any business with 500 or fewer employees

Any private nonprofit that has 500 or fewer employees — or otherwise meets the SBA’s size requirements

Sole proprietorships and independent contractors

Tribal businesses, cooperatives, and employee-owned businesses

Next, figure out which loan makes the most sense right now

Organizations will have to evaluate which loan program makes the most sense for their immediate needs, though multiple experts told Vox there’s no harm in applying to both of them.

In fact, this move is encouraged to make sure that businesses have more options — as long as they don’t use the two loans for the same purpose. (An EIDL loan could not be used to pay employees for the month of May if a PPP loan was already being used to do that, for example.)

The focus of the two programs, ultimately, is slightly different.

Under PPP, the loans are predominantly aimed at covering payroll costs (up to $100,000 per employee) but can be used to address other expenses as well, including utilities, rent, and interest on mortgage payments. Loans, of which 75 percent are used to cover payroll costs are 100 percent forgivable at the end of the eight-week period during which they are used, but if more than 25 percent of the money is used for other expenses, that portion of the funds will not be forgiven.

Under EIDL, the grants and loans can be used for a broader array of costs, including rent and mortgage payments, salaries, workers’ paid leave, and the business’s operational needs. Because small business owners don’t have to worry about as many rules around loan forgiveness, there’s slightly more flexibility regarding these funds.

The big difference between the two programs is that the PPP loans are entirely forgivable if companies meet a specific set of requirements, while EIDL loans (except for the $10,000 grant) are not. The cap for PPP loans is also higher, at $10 million per organization, while the EIDL loans cap out at $2 million.

There are two separate processes for applying for these loans

Applications for these loans are expected to go through two different channels.

To apply for the EIDL loan and the $10,000 grant: Small-business owners and nonprofits can apply directly with the Small Business Administration at this website: https://covid19relief.sba.gov/#/. When small businesses submit their applications for the EIDL loan, they can indicate they are interested in the emergency grant at the same time.

Small-business owners and nonprofits can apply directly with the Small Business Administration at this website: https://covid19relief.sba.gov/#/. When small businesses submit their applications for the EIDL loan, they can indicate they are interested in the emergency grant at the same time. To apply for the PPP loan: Organizations can call their current bank or lender directly, and they can download the application at the SBA website.

All 1,800 banks that currently participate in the SBA’s 7(a) loan program are expected to participate in the PPP option, and the Treasury Department is continuing to approve new lenders in recent weeks including PayPal, Square, and Intuit. Smaller lenders, like Community Development Financial Institutions, are also receiving dedicated funds for these loans, as part of the new bill.

Participating institutions already include hundreds around the country such as TD Bank and Bank of the West, though some — like Bank of America — may require businesses to have an existing account with the institution to be considered for PPP. (Businesses can check directly with their banks to determine if this is the case.)

A more comprehensive list of banks that currently offer 7(a) loans can be found at the SBA website, and businesses can look for lenders in their area using the agency’s Lender Match tool. In order to move the process along quickly, SBA is not expected to be involved in the approval process, and banks will be able to move forward with candidates independently.

Businesses and nonprofits need to be prepared to provide information about their payroll costs

The requirements across the two programs differ slightly, though both have relaxed the need for a personal guarantee of the loan:

PPP: Businesses are able to obtain 2.5 times their average monthly payroll costs for this loan, up to $10 million per organization. Costs that can be included as payroll costs include worker salaries, paid leave, health care benefits, commissions, tips, and state payroll taxes.

Average monthly payroll costs can be calculated using monthly costs the business experienced from January through December 2019 or the last 12 months, according to the Treasury Department. If a business is seasonal, it could use the average monthly costs the business experienced between February 15 or March 1, 2019, through June 30, 2019. If the business did not open until this year, the costs would be calculated based on average monthly costs in January and February of 2020.

Businesses should begin preparing documents that demonstrate their monthly payroll and operational costs including payroll tax filings and rental contracts.

EIDL: There are no personal guarantees needed for loans less than $200,000, according to Forbes. Business owners should have documentation including their previous federal tax return and information about personal assets and debt.

Be aware of the terms for loan forgiveness and for repayment

Components of both the EIDL offering and the PPP program are entirely forgivable, and each offers its own unique terms for repayment, which businesses should keep in mind as they are weighing the two.

PPP Terms

The PPP loans are 100 percent forgivable, depending on whether businesses lay off workers and how they use the money.

The loan will be completely forgiven if businesses do not lay off workers at all or if they rehire workers by June 30, 2020.

If a business lays off workers and does not rehire them, a portion of the loan will not be forgiven. If a business reduces the wages it pays out to a worker by more than 25 percent during the time it is using the loan, part of the loan will not be forgiven.

If the loan is used for costs that are not approved by the bill, those portions will also not be forgiven and will have specific repayment terms. Seventy-five percent of the loan must be used to cover payroll costs for the loan to be fully forgiven.

Repayment could be deferred for six months and will have an interest rate beginning at 1 percent. The maximum term of repayment is two years.

EIDL Terms

The $10,000 EIDL grant that businesses and nonprofits can apply for is forgivable and can be used for a wide range of business needs.

Aside from the $10,000 grant, the rest of the loan is not forgivable.

The loan will have a 3.75 percent interest rate for small businesses and a 2.75 percent interest rate for nonprofits, and repayment can be deferred for six months. The maximum term of repayment is 30 years.

Correction, April 3: A previous version of this article included the wrong number for the SBA helpline.

"['Sigal Samuel', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,Why you’re unlikely to get the coronavirus from runners or cyclists,"Share All sharing options for: Why you’re unlikely to get the coronavirus from runners or cyclists

Under social distancing, we’re all doing our best to stay sane, and one of the best ways to maintain sanity is to go out for some nice fresh air. But venturing outside can be stressful if you’re worried that the very air is full of virus particles just waiting to infect you.

So, how worried should you be that any time you go outside, you’ll contract coronavirus from a fellow pedestrian, runner, or cyclist who happens to exhale as they pass by?

The answer is, you probably don’t need to freak out about it. As long as you’re maintaining at least 6 feet of distance from other people and you’re not in a high-risk group, you’re engaged in a very low-risk activity, particularly if you and others are wearing masks.

Earlier this month, Belgian and Dutch engineers publicized some findings that went viral online and gave people the opposite impression. The engineers used a spray nozzle particle generator to simulate the spread of droplets we generate as we walk, run, or bike. Since the particles hit a trailing athlete who was farther than 6 feet away, the engineers concluded we need to maintain more distance than that to avoid the risk of contracting Covid-19.

They recommended staying 16 feet behind someone who’s walking, 33 feet behind someone who’s running or biking slowly, and 65 feet behind someone who’s biking hard. Those sorts of distances are almost impossible to maintain in big cities. So, as the findings made the rounds online, lots of people panicked.

But this research — despite being branded as a “study” in a much-shared Medium post aiming to summarize it — contained no input from epidemiologists or virologists and was not peer-reviewed. Its logic is deeply flawed.

“I think we should be very careful with making assumptions about transmission based on that ‘study,’ since it didn’t account for any variables related to transmissibility,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, adding, “It’s important to understand that infections are started with a minimum infectious dose of virus.”

In other words, the “study” failed to consider two key questions: How easy is it for particles traveling in the air outdoors to infect you? And how many particles containing infectious virus would you have to inhale to become infected?

The engineers simply concluded that any exposure was too much. But that’s not the case; the truth is more reassuring. Let’s break down each of the two questions in turn.

How easy is it for particles traveling in the air outdoors to infect you?

To start with, we should get clear on something that has proven confusing to lots of people: Is the coronavirus “airborne”?

The confusion stems from the fact that there’s an everyday meaning of the word “airborne” — carried in the air — and a technical scientific meaning, which is based on the size of the virus particles and how long the virus can linger in the air before losing its infectivity.

Public health experts like to refer to bigger particles that are heavy and thus fall fast as “droplets,” and tiny particles that evaporate faster than they can fall as “aerosols.” When a virus is transmissible as aerosols, they say it’s “airborne.”

We know for sure that the coronavirus moves as droplets. But what about aerosols?

“There’s no debate at all as to whether or not aerosols are generated (they are [at least in hospitals where medically invasive procedures are performed]), whether or not they contain virus (they do [at least at first]), and whether or not a particularly violent sneeze can propel them across a room (it can),” said Jennifer Kasten, a pathologist with training in infectious disease epidemiology and global health.

Research by MIT’s Lydia Bourouiba has shown that coughs and sneezes can release turbulent clouds of particles in droplet and aerosol form alike. The particles from a cough can travel as far as 16 feet and particles from a sneeze can travel as far as 26 feet.

That, and a handful of other studies, have left some people wondering if maybe we do need to stay much farther apart from one another than the recommended 6 feet.

But if we focus solely on the aerodynamics of particle dispersion, we obscure more crucial unanswered questions: How hardy is the virus when it’s in aerosol form? How long can it linger in the air before its protective coat of moisture dries up and it falls apart, ceasing to be infectious?

We’ve seen Covid-19 case clusters, like the one originating in a choir practice in Washington state, that seem to indicate that asymptomatic people can generate aerosols that make other people sick — at least when they’re closely packed together in an enclosed space, for a few hours, singing, which generates higher pressures than does breathing or speech.

Fortunately, increasing your distance, decreasing the duration of your exposure, and improving the ventilation of the air around you can all lower your risk. And being outdoors generally helps you do all three.

“The risks of virus transmissibility in the air outdoors is likely quite low in those contexts, although this risk hasn’t been definitively measured,” Rasmussen said. “Outside, things like sunlight, wind, rain, ambient temperature, and humidity can affect virus infectivity and transmissibility, so while we can’t say there’s zero risk, it’s likely low unless you are engaging in activities as part of a large crowd (such as a protest). Solitary outdoor exercise is likely low-risk.”

Rasmussen and Kasten both noted that a perfect sequence of events has to happen for a virus to jump from an infected passerby outdoors to you. The particles — enough of them to be able to kickstart an infection — have to spray out of the passerby with enough force to make their way over to you. The virus inside the particles has to survive while sunlight, humidity, wind, and other forces work to decay and disperse them. The particles have to land right in your upper throat or respiratory tract — or on your hands, which you then use to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth — and they have to get past all the barriers to infection in the respiratory system, like nose hairs and mucus. Then they have to dock up with your cells’ ACE-2 receptors and use them to enter the cells.

This is a pretty arduous sequence to execute properly, and it’s even more difficult for the virus if everyone involved — say, both you and the runner in front of you — is wearing a mask. You can see why, if you’re standing outdoors several feet away from an infected person, the virus might have a hard time making its way over to you at a high enough dose to actually infect you.

How many particles do you have to inhale to launch an infection?

One thing we’d all love to know about Covid-19 is what constitutes the infectious dose — that is, how many live virus particles you need to inhale at once before they kickstart an infection. Unfortunately, scientists just don’t have the answer yet.

“As animal model data continues to come out, we’ll have a much better idea about estimated ranges of infectious dose,” Rasmussen said.

In the meantime, some experts are estimating the infectious dose for Covid-19 from previous coronaviruses that have infected humans, like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

To develop a MERS infection, the number of virus particles you need to inhale is somewhere in the thousands, perhaps as high as 10,000. Willem van Schaik, a professor of microbiology at the University of Birmingham, estimates that to develop Covid-19, that number is lower, perhaps in the high hundreds or low thousands.

That’s just an educated guess, but it’s reasonable to assume it takes fewer particles to launch an infection in the case of Covid-19 than MERS, because Covid-19 is much more transmissible. Each person with Covid-19 infects two or three others on average, while for MERS that number is less than one.

Although we don’t know exactly how many particles it takes — 900? 1,500? — the point to bear in mind here is that you’re not going to contract Covid-19 if a single particle falls on you. One of the problems with the Belgian-Dutch exercise “study” is that its recommendations seem to be based on the idea that any exposure is too much.

Obviously, you don’t want to walk through someone’s fresh sneeze or cough cloud, and if this accidentally happens you should go home, change, and shower. But if you’re worrying about how many particles a passerby is generating with their exhalations, it may help to know that a recent study managed to quantify how many virus particles were detectable after patients who had Covid-19 and who were not wearing masks coughed five times into a petri dish at a distance of roughly 8 inches.

The scientists detected 363 virus particles on average per 1 ml of petri dish. That seems like a lot, but again, that was at a distance of 8 inches. If you’re 6 feet away (72 inches), much of that will disperse before you can inhale it — particularly if you’re outdoors, where factors like increased distance, decreased duration of exposure, and improved air ventilation are all working in your favor.

It may also help to know about two new studies suggesting that most Covid-19 transmission happens indoors, not outdoors. In China, a study of 318 outbreaks found that transmission occurred outdoors in only one of them. In Japan, a study found that “the odds that a primary case transmitted Covid-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment.” Note, however, that both of these are preprint papers (not yet peer reviewed).

An understanding of infectious dose, combined with an understanding of transmissibility as laid out above, should also help calm excessive levels of worry about picking up the virus from objects like mail or groceries. Remember that to kickstart an illness, you have to have enough virus particles to get an infection going, and it’s got to be live, infectious virus, not just dead RNA (genetic material that won’t harm you). The latter will simply fall apart after enough time on inert objects — up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel.

“Viral RNA does not imply the presence of infectious virus,” Kasten explained. “The virus, without host cells and a bit of moisture to keep it temporarily going, can fall apart, leaving bits of its RNA lying around like bleached bones in the sun. A researcher can come along with PCR [polymerase chain reaction, a common method in molecular biology] and detect the RNA, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they detected infectious virus.”

So, when you see a headline that seems frightening — for example, one saying that researchers found coronavirus on a cruise ship 17 days after passengers disembarked — just remember that doesn’t necessarily mean it was live, infectious virus.

“The good news is that we do know that while the virus can persist in the environment on different surfaces and in different environments, it does lose infectivity over time,” Rasmussen said. “So if you inhale a large number of total [virus particles] but only a small number of them are infectious, you are at much lower risk of actually getting infected.”

None of this is to say you should be cavalier when you venture into the outside world. Washing your hands, avoiding touching your face, being diligent about physical distancing, wearing masks in public, and disinfecting communal surfaces — all these things likely reduce transmission risk, and we should keep doing them, Rasmussen said. But she also said she feels fine about taking a walk with her husband outdoors.

Psychologically, different people have different levels of tolerance for risk. For some people, any risk that can be minimized, should be, no matter how small. For others, the recommended 6-foot distance, with masks, and the known decay of both the amount and the infectiousness of the virus — that’s good enough.

“The people who are 26-footers should know, though, that the 6-footers are not being foolhardy or endangering others unnecessarily,” Kasten said.

Asked if she could offer a way to assess the risk of various activities in terms we can easily wrap our minds around, Kasten said to consider the difference in the risk between taking a stroll through the park on an even path versus climbing up a steep cliff face.

“Sure, you could slip, fall, strike your head, and die on that path in the park. Likewise, you could free-solo successfully to the top of El Capitan. But most of us would accept the risk of the stroll and not accept [the risk of] dangling from the cliff,” she said. “Breathing in someone’s sneeze cloud, close by, without a mask — that’s the cliff face. Jogging several feet away, or getting the mail — that’s the park.”

"['Rebecca Heilweil', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,How the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory went from fringe to mainstream,"The first link John Gregory saw pushing a connection between 5G and the coronavirus pandemic was on a French conspiracy website called Les moutons enragés, which loosely translates as “The rabid sheep.” A January 20 post floated that the millimeter wave spectrum used by 5G technology and Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could be related, pointing to reports about Wuhan installing 5G towers before the outbreak. Three months later, conspiracy theorists making similar claims were setting cellphone towers on fire in Europe.

Gregory, a senior analyst at the internet trust tool NewsGuard, caught an early glimpse of the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory, but it didn’t take long before the fake news started to spread. Two days after the French blog post, a Belgian newspaper called Het Laatste Nieuws published an interview with a local doctor, who floated the unfounded claim that the coronavirus outbreak could be linked to 5G cellphone towers installed near Wuhan in 2019. The article was taken down within hours, but the theory had already spread to English-language Facebook pages. Gregory wasn’t surprised.

“There’s been a crowd that has been saying that 5G is harmful to human health for years, ever since 5G was first being proposed [and] well before any towers or networks were online,” he told Recode. “This is just their latest attempt to push those claims, tying them onto this current news story.”

Initial theories about the relationship between the coronavirus and 5G have now ballooned into all sorts of wild speculation. Some suggest that 5G networks cause radiation, which, in turn, triggers the virus. Others float that reports of the novel coronavirus were actually a cover-up for the installation of 5G towers. A few accounts push the idea that 5G and Covid-19 are part of a broader effort to “depopulate” Earth. Some think it might be connected to the American agriculture titan Monsanto.

As out-there as all this seems, it’s also dangerous. As certain people fall for these theories and act out, they stand to harm themselves and others. By early April, conspiracy theorists were setting cell towers on fire in Europe and starting to intersect with other conspiracy-minded communities like anti-vaxxers, raising fears that the towers could pose a threat to public health. In the face of these fears, it remains unclear if the platforms where these ideas are spreading — Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube — can do anything to stop the madness.

5G conspiracy theories have been around for years

The loose and incorrect reasons some have connected 5G technology to the coronavirus outbreak are myriad and maddening. Some seem to think that both 5G and the coronavirus are new, so they must be connected somehow. Others point to suspicious sources like misunderstood legislation as evidence that the government is hiding something in this global crisis. But ultimately, most of these ideas draw on an established well of confused concern about 5G technology and longstanding fears about new cellular technologies.

“This really crosses the spectrum — lots and lots of political leanings and different types of conspiracy theory can find something in the 5G theory,” explains Tom Phillips, the editor of Full Fact, a UK-based fact-checking organization, pointing out that similar fears were expressed during the introduction of 3G and wifi. “A lot of those fears were just transplanted onto 5G when the rollout of that began.”

Tinfoil-hat types have found company on the internet from the early days of the technology. There are the 9/11 truthers, the people who call mass shooting survivors “crisis actors,” and those who believe contrails (water condensation left in the sky by airplanes) are actually odious chemicals. The theories, however untrue, tend to bleed into one another, and they can feed on crises where we still lack answers to many basic questions. The Covid-19 pandemic is no different.

The genre of conspiracy theories linked to wireless technology has been around for decades, and the debate over whether things like cellphones lead to brain cancer or mind control has gained newfound relevance with the rollout of 5G technology. Some theories postulate that 5G, like earlier generations of cellular technology, also causes cancer or, somehow, kills birds. Others are more extreme, suggesting that the technology can cause “electromagnetic sensitivity,” bringing about headaches and harming the immune system.

Last year, the New York Times traced the present 5G anxiety to a Florida physicist named Bill Curry, who published incorrect research showing a correlation between rising frequency of radio waves and tissue damage in the brain. Curry failed to account for the fact that human brains are shielded from such radiation by their skin and skulls, but a chart he made about the theory has become canon in the world of cellular technology conspiracy theories. The Russian television network RT has pointed to such ideas to push theories about the dangers of 5G technology, as has Infowars founder Alex Jones. Infowars even sells a “5G Kills” T-shirt.

Many of the sites that promoted 5G conspiracy theories are now steering their audiences toward the 5G coronavirus connection. The “uncensored health news” website Natural News, for example, has long warned of the supposed dangers of 5G technology. Lately, the site has run headlines like: “Did the 5G rollout in Wuhan damage the innate cellular defense cells of the population, putting the people at risk of complications and death from coronavirus?”

And as the initial spread suggests, the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory has certainly found supporters on social media. Many Covid-19 conspiracy theories have festered on anti-5G Facebook groups, like the nearly year-old, 8,000-member-strong group “Stop 5G Global Community” and the three-year-old “Lawful Stop5G Rebellion No Violence,” which has almost 35,000 members. Twitter and YouTube similarly are hot spots for spreading 5G misinformation, and Bloomberg reports that there is some evidence of a coordinated effort to push 5G coronavirus content, though the details and origins of such a campaign remain unclear.

This idea went mainstream because influential people amplified it

It looks like the earliest posts linking 5G and Covid-19 popped up in mid-January. That newspaper article about the Belgian doctor is often cited as an inciting incident.

Still, it’s difficult to find the precise origin for the 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory. Zignal Labs, an impact intelligence platform that studies online discourse, identified a Twitter account that on January 19 tweeted, “Wuhan has 5,000+ #5G base stations now and 50,000 by 2021 — is it a disease or 5G?” while retweeting a Russia Today article about a new, flu-like virus in China. Although the post got little engagement, it’s a sign that the theory had already been spreading to some degree. The 5G coronavirus conspiracy nevertheless festered on the internet for two more months before it started to surge in mentions, according to Zignal Labs data collected from Twitter and other platforms.

The plot really took off when celebrities started to tell their followers about the supposed link between of 5G and the pandemic. In March, interest spiked around the time that singer Keri Hilson tweeted:

People have been trying to warn us about 5G for YEARS. Petitions, organizations, studies...what we’re going thru is the affects of radiation. 5G launched in CHINA. Nov 1, 2019. People dropped dead. See attached & go to my IG stories for more. TURN OFF 5G by disabling LTE!!!

Interest surged again at the start of April, when the attacks on as many as 50 cell towers in the UK became an international news story, and eventually leading executives of companies like Verizon and Vodafone to ask government officials to intervene.

The flurry of celebrities amplifying the conspiracy theory continued. Rapper Wiz Khalifa tweeted on April 3: “Corona? 5g? Or both?” That same day, actor Woody Harrelson posted a video about the theory on Instagram, where he has more than 2 million followers (these posts have since been deleted). British rapper M.I.A., boxer Amir Khan, actor John Cusack, music producer Teddy Riley, and TV personality Amanda Holden all shared thoughts about the conspiracy with their millions of followers around this time. As recently as April 20, conservative commentators Diamond and Silk were warning their millions of followers of the supposed link between 5G and coronavirus.

QAnon supporters have also gotten involved in promoting the 5G conspiracy. One Q follower has argued that the symptoms of Covid-19 are suspiciously “similar to exposure to 5G,” which is not true, and has linked the rollout of 5G in Italy to the country’s high infection rate. She said in a tweet, “If you try to connect the dots from Covid-19 (which I am implying is a made-up illness to explain the side effects of the 5G rollout) to 5G, the media will tell you it is a conspiracy theory.”

Conspiracy theorists have also connected the 5G narrative with the claim that Bill Gates might be behind the virus, which is currently the most popular Covid-19 conspiracy theory online, according to Zignal Labs. The theory posits that Bill Gates not only caused the outbreak but also, somehow, used 5G to do it. One tweet identified by Recode, which has garnered thousands of likes and retweets, falsely posits the alleged Bill Gates connection and finds it suspicious that Facebook is blocking accounts that share information about the 5G coronavirus conspiracy.

This or other theories about 5G and coronavirus seem ridiculous, but that’s not the point. In a pandemic, one person’s understanding of reality and especially how that causes them to behave has a direct impact on the health of those around them. In the UK arson attacks, for example, vandals tried to burn down a cell tower being used by a nearby hospital and, likely, by very sick patients trying to communicate with loved ones. In any given community, those who doubt the reality of the coronavirus pandemic might also be resistant to taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

“If you think that 5G is causing coronavirus, then why would you wear a mask? Why would you social distance?” warns Alan Duke of Lead Stories, another fact-checking organization that partners with Facebook.

Things could get worse as time goes on. Research from Zignal Labs shows overlaps between anti-vaccination conspiracy theories and the 5G theory. This could be cause for concern, as certain conspiracy theorists might refuse a Covid-19 vaccine when one is eventually produced. That could put more vulnerable people at risk.

Tech companies are struggling to keep up

An especially frustrating element of all this is how much tech companies have struggled to combat coronavirus misinformation. As long as the pandemic has been in the news, there has been a seemingly endless torrent of false information about it.

The federal government, for one, has taken a stand against this particular conspiracy. In a statement to Recode, a spokesperson for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) insisted that “5G technology has nothing whatsoever to do with the spread of the coronavirus.” The agency has directed people to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s rumor control page for more information on this and other conspiracy theories.

As coronavirus conspiracy theories have grown more prominent, tech platforms have become more aggressive. But none of them has completely conquered the problem of suppressing false information about the coronavirus pandemic, especially as it relates to 5G technology.

Facebook says it’s significantly expanded its willingness to take down fake news and conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus. The company once simply flagged these posts as having been fact-checked, using third-party partners like Lead Stories and Full Fact. Now posts that include false claims about 5G and Covid-19 are being taken down, along with other false coronavirus-related content. Facebook has also started retroactively notifying people that they have read false content and is limiting the distribution of groups that continue to share fake news.

Last week, Facebook removed two large anti-5G groups. The takedown followed a report from the anti-hate nonprofit Hope Not Hate that people were using those communities to actively push for the destruction of phone masts. Still, some anti-5G Facebook groups remain active and host discussions of conspiracy theories about Bill Gates.

YouTube has also tried to be more assertive about this content. The video platform took down an interview with British conspiracy theorist David Icke after he floated the 5G theory in a livestreamed interview. According to the company, content that pushes the idea that the virus doesn’t exist or is caused by 5G now violates its policies and is supposed to be removed. Still, at the time of publication, searching the platform could easily surface those types of videos.

Twitter is only taking down certain posts. A spokesperson told Recode that the platform is prioritizing taking down posts that include “a call to action that could potentially cause harm.” The company says that since March 18, it’s taken down more than 2,200 tweets violating its rules around Covid-19 content.

There’s a chance this struggle to contain a dangerous conspiracy theory will endure. Part of what drove the 5G coronavirus conspiracy to the mainstream was a lack of good information about how the virus spreads and how it works, questions that scientists are still working to answer. But the theory about 5G and Covid-19 existed in relative online obscurity until it was amplified by people with influence. Around the same time, others took to the streets, lighting fires and forcing the media, politicians, and corporate leaders to respond.

One possible upside to the theory seeing the spotlight is that it’s also attracting scrutiny. Believers can’t stay inside their filter bubbles as easily when the conspiracy is being debunked. So there’s a chance the prominence of the 5G coronavirus conspiracy will abate in the coming months. The moderators at technology platforms like Facebook and Twitter know what to look for, and that might help.

Conspiracy theories like this rarely go away completely, though. It will likely join the ranks of its predecessors: the ones about 5G killing birds or older cellular technologies causing brain cancer or wifi leading to mind control. It’s part of the canon now. We can only hope the fact that more people know about the 5G coronavirus conspiracy also means that more people know it’s not true.

"['Umair Irfan', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,How common is Covid-19? What 2 controversial antibody studies can and can’t tell us.,"The question of how many people in the United States currently have, or have already had, the novel coronavirus is one of the most urgent that scientists need to answer.

It’s agonizing to not have this information because it could stop more people being infected and help policymakers figure out when it’s safe to reopen the economy.

Recently, two research groups in California from Stanford University and the University of Southern California (with some overlap between them) took a stab at estimating just how much the virus has spread in two populations: residents of Santa Clara County and Los Angeles County.

Their results are preliminary and haven’t been peer-reviewed by other scientists or published in a journal. But they suggest there were vastly more infections than the number of confirmed cases in those areas, perhaps as many as 85 times more.

If their estimates are correct, that suggests the virus is far more prevalent in the population than previously thought, but also that the disease is far less deadly. However, other scientists noted there were major flaws with these studies and quickly picked apart the findings on Twitter.

What a weird turn to see John Ioannidis pushing one of sloppiest studies in the deluge of Covid-19 papers. If he weren't an author I would expect the Stanford serostudy to show up in one of his talks as a particularly potent cocktail of bad research practices. — alex rubinsteyn (@iskander) April 19, 2020

Critiques ranged from how the researchers recruited participants to the accuracy of the tests they used.

While a finding that Covid-19 isn’t as dangerous as once thought may be reassuring, the evidence presented by these studies may do more to obscure than clarify the situation.

Health officials are still struggling to control the pandemic, and there is immense pressure for information needed to make critical decisions. But for a survey of the spread of the disease to be useful, it needs to be conducted on a larger scale and with more rigor.

The Covid-19 antibody surveys found that the virus is more common and less dangerous than previously thought

One of the biggest problems with figuring out how many people have been infected with Covid-19 is how stealthy this virus can be. It spreads easily between people, and many can be infected without showing any symptoms. So estimating the prevalence of the virus in a population based just on hospitalizations, deaths, and positive tests vastly underestimates its spread. As of April 24, the US has reported more than 895,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19.

The researchers behind the two California studies wanted to fill in this blank. They tested people for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, by screening blood serum, the liquid part of blood that’s left behind after clotting. Such serology tests can reveal who was previously infected with the virus, even if the virus is no longer present in their body. The tests also could give scientists information on possible immunity to the virus.

In Santa Clara County (population 1.9 million), researchers conducted serology tests in 3,300 participants; 2,718 adults and 612 children. Based on the number of people who tested positive for antibodies to the virus, the researchers concluded that between 2.49 percent and 4.1 percent of Santa Clara residents had been infected — between 48,000 and 81,000 people.

That’s 50 to 85 times the number of confirmed cases at the time of the study. Scientists expect more people have been infected with the virus than have been confirmed by tests, due to low levels of testing and many people only having mild cases. But this number is much higher than previous estimates, and other researchers have been critical of the result.

Meanwhile, the antibody survey in Los Angeles County (population 10 million) didn’t specify the number of people tested but concluded that between 2.8 percent and 5.6 percent of adults in the county carry antibodies to the virus. There were 7,994 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the county at the start of the study, so the projection indicated that 28 to 55 times more people may have been infected than previous testing had confirmed.

The California studies are preliminary, but they still have significant problems that overshadow their findings

The Santa Clara study is a preprint report, meaning that it hasn’t been peer-reviewed. The study, like many on Covid-19, was hosted on a preprint website so that other scientists could take a look without waiting months for the review process to run its course. That can be helpful in a rapidly moving crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic. But the methods, data analysis, and results haven’t been critiqued by other researchers and could have significant flaws that would have been corrected in a published paper.

The LA County results, meanwhile, haven’t even been written up as a paper (they were announced in a press release), and researchers say they are still testing more people.

Questions started to emerge about the conclusions of both studies shortly after they were posted.

Addendum: Folks commenting that people self-selected into the survey because they had been sick and wanted confirmation. Agreed, this is what I meant by “consent bias.” This is expected w/ volunteer studies. How to adjust/avoid it? Household samples are great but take longer. — Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) April 18, 2020

For one, they didn’t follow best practices for study design. In the Santa Clara study, researchers acknowledged these limitations. They recruited their participants through a Facebook ad, so it wasn’t a random sample of the population, and they tested people at a drive-through site, so participants had to have access to a car. The sample overrepresented younger white women and underrepresented Hispanic and Asian people. The study also didn’t control for age. “The overall effects of such biases is hard to ascertain,” authors wrote.

As a result, they likely sampled people who were motivated to be tested, oftentimes people who thought they may have been infected. That may have boosted the prevalence rate of antibodies in the sample.

The Los Angeles study recruited participants through a marketing firm from a database that is representative of the population.

The tests themselves also pose a problem. Right now, there are only four serology tests for Covid-19 that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and even those were only under emergency use guidance (which means they didn’t go through the full validation process).

The antibody test used in these studies, from a company called Premier Biotech, was not FDA-approved. Researchers in the Santa Clara study reported it to be 80.3 percent sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 99.5 percent specific to them.

The problem is that even seemingly accurate tests don’t do well when the thing they are looking for is scarce. Right now, there’s still only a tiny fraction of the population that has ever been infected with SARS-CoV-2, so false positives end up as a disproportionately large share of the total number of positive results.

“So if you have 1 percent of your population infected and you have a test that’s only 99 percent specific, that means that when you find a positive, 50 percent of the time will be a real positive and 50 percent of the time it won’t be,” said Deborah Birx, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, at a press conference on April 20.

6/7 In a low risk population, false positives quickly outnumber true positives that the results are very difficult to interpret. Even with a positive test, you're more likely than not to be negative. This all has implications for the use of antibody tests for ""immune passports."" — Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) April 23, 2020

Other researchers said they found problems in the calculations conducted in the study.

I have been corresponding with the authors of the well-known Santa Clara County COVID-19 preprint, and I am alarmed at their sloppy behavior. The confidence interval calculation in their preprint made demonstrable math errors - *not* just questionable methodological choices. — Will Fithian (@wfithian) April 21, 2020

Andrew Gelman, a statistics and political science professor at Columbia University, criticized the findings on his blog. “I think the authors of the above-linked paper owe us all an apology,” he wrote. “We wasted time and effort discussing this paper whose main selling point was some numbers that were essentially the product of a statistical error.”

The estimates reported in these surveys don’t line up with real-world data on deaths

Based on these studies’ conclusions, the deadliness of Covid-19 should be way lower than has been actually seen. The low-end estimates of the infection fatality rate — that is, the percentage of people who were infected who later died from the virus — were barely above the percentage of the total population killed by the disease in Covid-19 hot spots. (The infection fatality rate is distinct from the case fatality rate. The latter focuses on fatalities based on reported cases, whereas the former is based on all infections, including those that resulted in no symptoms and went unreported.)

The first study would put the Santa Clara infection fatality rate for Covid-19 between 0.12 percent and 0.2 percent. For the Los Angeles study, that would put the infection fatality rate roughly between 0.13 percent and 0.27 percent. By comparison, the World Health Organization estimates seasonal influenza has an infection mortality rate “well below” 0.1 percent.

The estimates from these serology surveys don’t comport with the actual results seen in Covid-19 hot spots like Italy and New York.

In Lombardy, Italy, for instance, more than 12,500 people have been killed out of a population of 10 million, meaning 0.12 percent of the total number of people there have died of Covid-19. If one were to limit the denominator to just the number of people infected, the fatality rate would be much higher.

Similarly, New York City has already seen 0.12 percent of its total population die due to Covid-19. It stands to reason the infection fatality rate is much higher, since only a fraction of the population has been infected.

Across the board, one would expect the infection fatality rate from Covid-19 to be higher than the population fatality rate, so the estimates based on the California studies seem suspiciously low.

Why we need to be careful about using hasty results

It would be handy to know how many people have had this coronavirus and might have some immunity to it — we’re in a unique moment where huge public health decisions need to be made swiftly about when to lift social distancing measures. So it’s important to make sure the studies on these critical topics are robust.

The studies didn’t lay out the implications for the response to Covid-19. But one of the authors, Stanford University epidemiologist John Ioannidis, has previously suggested that a lack of information about the Covid-19 pandemic may be causing officials to overreact with “draconian countermeasures” if the fatality rate is much lower than previously thought.

“It’s like an elephant being attacked by a house cat,” Ioannidis wrote in a March 17 editorial for Stat News. “Frustrated and trying to avoid the cat, the elephant accidentally jumps off a cliff and dies.”

But if they’re wrong, people’s health and lives are at risk. And they might very well be wrong.

Even if the coronavirus’s infection fatality rate is in fact this low, that will hardly matter if social distancing restrictions end too soon, because the fatality rate is also related to access to health care. With more person-to-person contact, the number of infections would grow, sending more people to hospitals. If there aren’t enough beds and equipment for this surge, the fatality rate will rise as a share of the number of people infected.

And the debate over the specific value of the infection fatality rate is tangential for health workers on the ground who are on the front lines of this pandemic. Covid-19 is clearly dangerous and deadly. Already some of the top health care systems — in Northern Italy and New York City — have been overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients. Yet the vast majority of people, even in pandemic hot spots, remain vulnerable to the virus.

Whether seroprevalence is 2% or 3% is mostly of academic interest. What’s clear is that the notion that we all got infected and didn’t know it and now we are near herd immunity is completely unrealistic. Our communities are still almost completely susceptible. 2/ — Caitlin Rivers, PhD (@cmyeaton) April 22, 2020

To be clear: The conclusions of these surveys could be pointing in the right direction. Covid-19 could be way more prevalent and far less deadly than anyone has realized. But the evidence presented by the Santa Clara and Los Angeles studies isn’t enough to make a decision about relaxing social distancing or other pandemic control measures.

Serological surveys are critical to the public health response to Covid-19. However, weak studies do little to satiate the desperate need for information about the pandemic. Assessing the spread of the virus within a population is an essential step, but it needs much more rigorous research to yield anything worthwhile.

Such studies could be strengthened by sampling larger numbers of people within a population and truly randomizing who is tested. The problem of false positives and negatives can be countered by repeated testing of participants.

Conducting a study like this would be more time-consuming and expensive. And one study alone won’t cut it; multiple serological surveys are needed around the world to illuminate the true extent of the disease.

To this end, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have their own large serological surveys underway for Covid-19. NIH is recruiting up to 10,000 volunteers across the US. The CDC is also conducting a national survey, as well as targeting Covid-19 hot spots and people at higher risk of exposure to the virus.

There is no definite timeline for when these studies will wrap, but they stand to yield a sharper picture of the spread of the new coronavirus. And from there, health officials can start to focus on how to let things go back to normal.

"['Brian Resnick Umair Irfan', 'Brian Resnick', 'Umair Irfan', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,What immunity to Covid-19 might actually mean,"The Covid-19 coronavirus meets its most formidable foe the moment it enters the human body.

The immune system is waiting, ready for action, and it determines who dies and who survives. It is why the vast majority of the infected have recovered from the disease.

Yet one of the most important unknowns is why some people’s immune systems are up to the task of clearing out the virus while others are sluggish or overreact, leading to death. Just as vexing:

How do we know for sure if a person is immune to Covid-19 after infection?

What percentage of the US population will be immune after this first wave of infections is over?

Will immunity last over time, or will it fade?

Can a vaccine provide immunity and stop the pandemic?

It’s helpful in thinking through these unanswered questions to understand how the immune system works (collectively and in individuals), how immunity testing works, and how immunity to similar viruses changes over time. It’s also comforting to know that if you get Covid-19, your body will try very, very hard to save you. And if it doesn’t, it could be because it tried too hard.

So here is a guide to the immune system: antibodies, serological tests, reinfection, and immunological memory, explained.

Your immune system is like a beautifully complex orchestra. It plays two movements.

The first thing to know about the immune system is that it is not simple. At all.

A huge array of cells and chemicals your body produces work in concert to clear a foreign invader from your body. “There’s a lot of elegance to this whole system,” Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine, says. “It’s like an orchestra.” All these cells and chemicals have to work in concert — each with a different part to play — to defeat the virus.

A viral infection begins when a virus enters a cell of your body. In the case of Covid-19, which is transmitted mostly by respiratory droplets, maybe that takes place somewhere in the lining of your nose or in the area of your lungs directly in contact with the air you inhale.

The virus then attaches to a cell — via a protein on the cell’s surface called ACE-2 — and lets itself in.

There, it begins to wreak havoc. The virus hijacks the cell’s machinery to make copies of itself. Those copies break out of the cell and then spread around your body. The copies enter more of your cells, make more copies, and so on. This is going viral, in the literal sense, and it’s a process your body works furiously to stop.

If the immune system is an orchestra in concert, its music can be broken down into two movements.

First, the opening: the innate immune response. This is the base-level protection you have to defend against infections — even those your body has never seen before.

Iwasaki explains that every cell of your body has something of its own immune system in miniature. Your cells “have a mechanism to detect virus infection,” she says. Every cell is looking out for telltale genetic signs of viral replication. Once that’s found, your cells “start secreting these cytokines [signaling molecules] to tell the neighboring cells that there’s a viral infection,” she says. “It will signal that cell to make a lot of antiviral proteins. Every part of the viral life cycle is targeted by hundreds of genes that are induced by this.”

“There’s a lot of elegance to this whole system. It’s like an orchestra.”

The innate immune response will then try to stop the virus in its tracks there, but it can fail, as we know. Viruses — those sneaky bastards — have evolved ways to counter this initial response. The viruses “might encode proteins that degrade some of these signaling molecules,” Iwasaki says. “Even though we have this amazing system, viruses try to circumvent it.”

If the innate immune system can’t get rid of the infection, the second movement in this orchestration begins: the adaptive immune system. It has a vast array of instruments, each tuned to a specific task.

There are dendritic cells, which act as messengers from the innate immune system and tell the adaptive immune system which viral proteins it should seek out and destroy. There are killer T-cells, which hunt down and kill cells that have been infected. There are helper T-cells, which stimulate killer T-cells and recruit yet another class of cells called macrophages to gobble up infected cells, and they also stimulate B-cells, which bring this whole concert to a crescendo.

B-cells are critically important because they produce antibodies. These are little proteins that bind, specifically, to a single distinct part of a virus or pathogen and make it unable to hijack your cells. Antibodies can also identify invaders for other immune cells to destroy, and they can mark infected cells for destruction before a virus can burst out. And after an infection fades, the antibodies that linger can prevent the same virus from rising again.

But this process takes time.

“When you first get infected with SARS-Cov-2, it usually takes anywhere from 10 to 14 days to make antibodies that are effective,” says Vineet Menachery, an immunologist who studies coronaviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch. “That immunity actually peaks between four and eight weeks after you’ve been infected. The antibodies are really powerful at that point.”

It takes a long time because an antibody has to be unique for the virus it’s trying to protect against. It takes a while — and some trial and error — to both build an antibody that can perfectly bind to the contours of the virus and to produce millions of copies of that antibody. “The magnitude of potential antibodies is somewhere in the neighborhood of quadrillions or quintillions,” Angela Rasmussen, a Columbia University virologist, says. But your immune system can narrow the choices down to the right formulation to clear the virus from your body.

The process isn’t simple, but you can be in awe of it, like you can be in awe of a timepiece constructed from hundreds of delicately selected parts. “I teach an entire semester course on this,” Iwasaki says. This is the delicate process that a vaccine is trying to replicate artificially.

This antibody construction process can backfire, however. In some cases, antibodies bind to the virus, Iwasaki explains, and instead of blocking the virus, they’re taken up by white blood cells. Those white blood cells then go haywire, producing molecules called cytokines. Ordinarily, these chemicals promote inflammation throughout the body.

Inflammation is something that makes us feel sick, but it also helps us survive. “People often think of swelling when they think of inflammation,” Rasmussen says. Swelling occurs because cells from your immune system are rushing into the site of the infection. These immune cells “have to get out of your blood vessels,” she says, in order to corral the infection. “It’s a lovely process called rolling extravasation,” she says. “Your tissue gets inflamed because the balance of fluid is being changed.”

But sometimes, so many cytokines are released that they trigger white blood cells to turn against healthy cells. That can then lead to organ failure and death. “And that ultimately makes the disease as bad as it is,” Iwasaki says.

It’s unclear why a “cytokine storm,” as this reaction is called, might impact some people severely and not others, though there are indications that aging is a factor, as are underlying conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. Researchers are also now looking for genetic clues to see who is most at risk. Thankfully, though, doctors do have some insights into how to treat this overreaction.

This whole orchestra ends when the immune system neutralizes all the virus in the body. That doesn’t always mean the virus is purged; many viruses can linger in a latent state in the body without reproducing or causing symptoms. These latent viruses can flare up when the immune system is weakened, causing opportunistic infections. At the same time, you’ll be left with antibodies circulating in your blood.

But for reasons scientists don’t quite understand, for some infections — and notably, in other types of coronavirus infections — antibody levels can wane over a period of years.

How do we know if someone is immune? There are two main tests.

So how do doctors and scientists know if this process has been successful? How can they know if someone is now immune to the virus that causes Covid-19?

They test for it.

In particular, blood tests, also known as immunity tests or serological tests, can reveal who possesses antibodies to the virus. Deploying these tests will help answer a lot of questions. Most basically, it can help a person know if they have had Covid-19.

On a larger scale — if deployed in well-designed studies — serological tests could reveal the complete picture of the pandemic. They can also help scientists answer basic questions like:

How many people infected with the disease die?

What percentage of the population has been infected?

Who, and how many, may have spread it without knowing it?

Serological tests could also potentially allow people who have immunity to return to work. That could be a huge boost to front-line health workers who may have been exposed to the virus but are desperately needed back in action.

Just finding the antibodies isn’t always enough, though. Scientists also need to do additional tests to make sure those antibodies are potent.

“There are two main types of antibody tests,” Menachery explains. The first just looks for antibodies and can be completed in a few hours. This is called an ELISA test (short for Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay). And it doesn’t provide the most complete picture of immunity.

The second test is more involved, and rarer. It’s called a serum neutralization test, and it takes a few days to process. It not only looks for antibodies, it then exposes those antibodies to a virus in a cell culture to see how effective the antibodies are in stopping the virus.

Ideally, scientists will correlate the two tests and figure out which concentrations of antibodies confer the highest level of immunity. “This work is ongoing,” Menachery says. It’s still not known what levels of antibodies are needed to have lasting, protective immunity. (What also remains to be shown: that the presence of antibodies also means you can’t give the virus to someone else.)

These tests are useful, but they don’t answer everything. As noted earlier, it takes days, if not weeks, for the body to produce antibodies. So a negative antibody test doesn’t mean the virus isn’t present. And since antibodies are produced during an infection and linger after it’s cleared, a positive antibody test doesn’t mean that the virus is no longer active.

Confirming whether someone can still spread Covid-19 requires a separate genetic test like an RT-PCR test that detects the active virus.

Your levels of antibody can wane over time, but it doesn’t mean you are defenseless

Even if people do become immune, “one thing we don’t know about still is how long that immunity would last,” Rasmussen says. “And that’s unfortunately not something we can determine until we wait months or years in the future, and test again and see if those antibodies are still there.”

For reasons scientists don’t quite understand, for some infections, your immunity never wanes. People who are immune to smallpox, for example, are immune for life: Antibodies that protect against smallpox have been found as long as 88 years after a vaccination.

Less reassuring here is that scientists have observed antibody levels to other coronaviruses (there are four coronavirus strains that infect people as the common cold) can wane over a period of years. A few weeks after an infection, antibody levels will be at their highest. But “a year from now, that number is likely going to be a little bit lower, and five years from now it’s likely to be potentially a lot lower or a little bit lower, and we don’t know the factors that change that,” Menachery says.

However, even if you lose the antibodies, it doesn’t mean you are again completely susceptible to the virus. Yes, none of this is simple.

There have been a few experiments where volunteers were willingly exposed to a coronavirus strain that produces a common cold. These studies show it’s common for the antibodies to these other coronavirus strains to decline after a year or so.

“The majority of people that don’t have serum neutralizing antibodies [i.e., antibodies that take out the virus], they get infected again, but they didn’t get that sick,” Menachery says. You couldn’t do this type of test for Covid-19, he adds; it’s too dangerous.

There have been reports of a few patients out of China who had mild symptoms of Covid-19 who did not have detectable neutralizing antibodies after recovery, though they did have another form of antibody that binds to the virus. “It’s unclear whether they have protective immunity,” Nature reports. Yes, there is more than one type of antibody, and they do different things, because none of this is simple.

Luckily, even if your antibodies against a coronavirus decline, your body has a backup plan.

Certain types of B-cells — recall, these are the ones that make antibodies — become memory B-cells. These save the instructions for producing a particular antibody, but they aren’t active. Instead, they hide out — in your spleen, in your lymph nodes, perhaps at the original site of your infection — waiting for a signal to start producing antibodies again.

For reasons scientists don’t quite understand, for some infections, your immunity never wanes

With the memory B-cells in reserve, instead of waiting two weeks or more to get antibody production going, “you’ll only have to wait maybe two or three days,” Menachery says. “So that means, yes, you can get infected again, but you may not even know you’re sick. If you do get sick, maybe it’s a very minor infection.”

Generally, he says, the more severe your infection, the more antibodies your immune system will produce, and the longer they’ll stay in your bloodstream post-infection. So, he says, “there is some concern that if you had a mild infection that your level of protection may not last long.”

You may have seen some reports of people testing positive a second time for Covid-19 after recovering. The experts we spoke to say these reports are likely due to flaws in testing. “I think the risk of being infected more than once from SARS-CoV-2 is nil,” says Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Duke University, in an email.

That may be because as you progress in the illness, the testing for Covid-19 becomes more inconsistent.

Virus variation likely has more to do with sample collection (swabs especially) and assay sensitivity with low positives than re-activation or re-infection (as shown here). https://t.co/xdAJR3muD8 — Nathan Grubaugh (@NathanGrubaugh) April 14, 2020

“Often at the time that virus diseases present themselves, it’s fairly far into the replication of that virus in that person,” says Diane Griffin, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. “Many symptoms of virus disease are actually manifestations of the immune response to the disease. Often things are starting to get better at the time you’re starting to figure out someone even has a virus infection.”

At least in the short term, it’s probably more the case that the people who have tested positive after recovering haven’t completely cleared the virus from their system or that a prior negative test was inaccurate.

Over the long term, the immune system itself becomes less effective with advancing age. And as people get older, they can acquire more chronic illnesses that can hamper the response to a virus, even if it’s one the immune system recognizes. It will be years, though, before scientists can understand what aging means for immunity to Covid-19.

Why widespread serology testing isn’t going to necessarily save us

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now conducting serological surveys for Covid-19 antibodies in several places across the US.

It’s an attempt to figure out who was previously infected with the virus, particularly if they never exhibited symptoms. A survey like this can show the actual background rate of infection and answer critical questions like what proportion of people have been infected without showing symptoms and where the virus has spread in a population, and quantify the overall rates of severe complications. Knowing these variables can help health officials better target interventions.

Many people who may have been infected also want to know if they are immune so they can safely leave lockdowns. Countries like Germany are even considering granting immunity passports so individuals can return to work.

Such testing could make a difference in a handful of cases, like for doctors and nurses who were infected or may have been exposed but are desperately needed back in action. But serological testing is unlikely to be a wholesale solution to reopening the economy.

Again, scientists are still uncertain about the robustness and duration of immunity that a Covid-19 infection confers, so a positive antibody test at this point doesn’t guarantee that one can safely end social distancing measures. If immunity does fade after a year or two, the same person could be vulnerable to reinfection.

Meanwhile, to reopen schools, shops, and offices across the board, large numbers of people would have to have immunity. Without a vaccine, that would mean that the virus would have to infect vast swaths of the population, in the process sending thousands to the hospital and to their graves. That is exactly what measures like lockdowns and social distancing are trying to avoid.

While this outbreak has been ghastly, it has not been so bad as to bring about herd immunity in any quick time frame. There have been some — imperfect — serological studies that suggest the virus has infected more people than previously estimated. But even if true, the studies don’t mean we’re anywhere close to achieving herd immunity.

Whether seroprevalence is 2% or 3% is mostly of academic interest. What’s clear is that the notion that we all got infected and didn’t know it and now we are near herd immunity is completely unrealistic. Our communities are still almost completely susceptible. 2/ — Caitlin Rivers, PhD (@cmyeaton) April 22, 2020

So it’s unlikely that immunity can be a benchmark for when it’s okay to go back to normal across the population, and even in individual cases, it requires careful consideration of risks and benefits.

Getting infected with Covid-19 isn’t the only way to become immune to the virus

For those who have not yet contracted the virus, the main form of protection from Covid-19 right now is prevention. But there are several options scientists are studying that could help those who were never infected fend off the illness.

Chief among them is a vaccine. A vaccine can take various forms, including a weakened version of the virus itself, a small piece of the virus, or genetic material that prompts the immune system to manufacture antibodies to the virus.

Developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 would be the ideal solution to the Covid-19 pandemic since it’s a form of prevention that would also hasten the end of costly measures like lockdowns, quarantines, and social distancing.

But it’s a time-consuming approach. Many experts estimate that it will take at least a year to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus.

Vaccines can also pose risks. A small number of people can have dangerous adverse reactions to a vaccine, like severe allergies. In rare cases, vaccines can cause a phenomenon called immune enhancement, where the vaccine makes the recipient’s immune system overreact to the virus target, leading to a more severe disease than in those who were unvaccinated.

Though these risks are small, vaccines have to be delivered to millions of people. That’s why vaccine development focuses so much on safety and reducing the risks of complications as much as possible. Researchers are looking into various ways to speed up development, including human challenge trials where volunteers are deliberately exposed to the virus to test their immunity with and without a vaccine.

Another tactic under investigation is using convalescent plasma. The idea is to harvest the liquid part of blood, including proteins used for clotting, from people who have survived Covid-19. This plasma contains antibodies to the virus, so scientists are seeing whether it can help people with active infections get better. Researchers are also studying whether convalescent plasma can be used as a prophylactic to prevent Covid-19 in the first place.

Companies are also developing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using mice genetically engineered to have human immune systems. These antibodies can also be used to treat or prevent the disease.

But antibody transfusions, whether they come from Covid-19 survivors or were created in a lab, only confer protection against the virus for a few months.

What is herd immunity?

The long-term strategy is to get enough people in a population immune to the virus so that it no longer spreads easily. This is known as herd immunity. It usually requires between 70 and 90 percent of a group of people to be immune in order to be effective, depending on the contagiousness of the virus.

With a large enough share of immunity in the population, even the remaining people who are not immune face a much lower likelihood of being infected. With few susceptible hosts in close proximity, pockets of infection quickly fade out. The question is whether this herd immunity is attained through vaccination or through infection.

The latter would not be ideal since it would involve millions getting sick from Covid-19. The United Kingdom was pursuing this approach back in early March but backed off its herd immunity strategy of limiting restrictions on movement and allowing people to be exposed. The country changed course when forecasters revealed that millions would likely contract the virus, overwhelming the UK’s health system. Sweden has adopted a similar approach and is now facing vastly more Covid-19 cases than its neighbors.

It’s also hard to gauge how close any country is to herd immunity since many people have likely been infected with the virus without knowing it. Figuring this out would require extensive testing for antibodies. And not everyone develops the same level of immunity from an infection. So vaccinating people against Covid-19 is the safer strategy.

Until then, widespread testing to identify the infected, isolating them, and tracing their contacts could help ease some of the pandemic control measures in place now.

How about what we can do as individuals?

Short of drugs like interferons, there isn’t much a person can do to boost their immune system or their response to Covid-19, despite what various supplements promise.

The best Covid-19 approach for individuals is healthy habits — maintain good hygiene, exercise, eat a balanced diet, get plenty of sleep, stay hydrated, manage any chronic health conditions like diabetes, and limit exposure to pollution.

How, in the meantime, do we make decisions without perfect knowledge of Covid-19 immunity?

Though the Covid-19 pandemic has been raging for several months, a lack of key information — from how many people were infected to the origins of the disease — continues to hamper the response.

“More science on almost every aspect of this new virus is needed, but in this pandemic, as with previous ones, decisions with great consequences must be made before definitive data are in,” wrote Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch in a column in the New York Times.

But the unknowns around immunity to the disease may be the most critical because they stand between the untenable present and a return to normal. Meanwhile, pressure is mounting to relax restrictions on movement to allow life to continue. With incomplete information, policymakers still have to make decisions that depend on immunity, but this can be done in ways that reduce risk.

“The best approach is to construct a conceptual model — a set of assumptions about how immunity might work — based on current knowledge of the immune system and information about related viruses, and then identify how each aspect of that model might be wrong, how one would know and what the implications would be,” Lipsitch wrote.

This is no easy task. It still might be the case that what we learn about immunity may not be enough for everything to go back to normal. We may need to wait, patiently, for a vaccine.

One advantage scientists have in the Covid-19 pandemic that they didn’t have in prior outbreaks is an unparalleled level of information-sharing among researchers around the world. Researchers are posting their preliminary findings online for the world to scrutinize and working across borders, collaborating on an unprecedented scale.

That has led to unknowns becoming known faster than ever. But the disease is continuing to spread, and the drastic pandemic response measures can’t continue forever, so some difficult choices lie ahead.

"['Emily Stewart', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,"“I’m being forced to choose between my health and my job”: Georgia’s controversial reopening plan, explained","Kristen Courville, a self-employed hairstylist in Alpharetta, Georgia, is in a terrifying conundrum: Her governor, Brian Kemp, says she can go back to work on Friday. On the one hand, her bills are racking up, and she needs to pay her rent. On the other hand, she’s scared of getting sick, and whenever she does open up, she’s worried clients won’t want to come in anyway. She’s laid out a plan to reopen, but it’s not been an easy decision.

“I’m being forced to choose between my health and my job,” Courville, 32, said.

The coronavirus crisis is hardly over in Georgia, but the state’s leadership has decided it’s time to start reopening parts of the economy there anyway. Republican Gov. Kemp announced in a tweet on Monday that businesses such as gyms, hair salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys, and nail salons will be allowed to resume some operations on Friday, April 24. And on Monday, April 27, theaters, social clubs, and restaurant dine-in services will be able to start back up as well.

Due to favorable data & more testing, gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barbers, cosmetologists, hair designers, nail care artists, estheticians, their respective schools & massage therapists can reopen Friday, April 24 with Minimum Basic Operations. #gapol — Governor Brian P. Kemp (@GovKemp) April 20, 2020

It won’t be back to business as usual entirely — bars, nightclubs, amusement parks, and live performance venues will stay shuttered. And businesses that are open have to comply with what the state is calling “minimum basic operations” standards, including screening workers for a fever, enhanced workplace sanitation, and staggering shifts. Businesses are also supposed to separate workspaces by 6 feet.

Many businesses, lawmakers, and consumers across the state were caught by surprise. To many, the maneuver seems preemptive and not all that well thought out. How do you cut someone’s hair from 6 feet away? How do you keep people at bowling alleys from touching, you know, the ball? And what even makes the bowling alley a priority in the first place?

Nobody has all of the answers on next steps when it comes to relaxing social distancing and letting economic activities start back up, including the federal government. Georgia, like most of the country and the world, is still struggling to wrap its arms around the health crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. But it appears to be determined to forge ahead on reopening the economy, and it’s going to be a case study in what that looks like — one conducted before health concerns are figured out.

Georgia’s governor seems determined to reopen the state’s economy, ready or not

Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor who was elected in 2018 and its previous former secretary of state, made the announcement on Monday about his state starting to reopen some business operations. Its shelter-in-place directive remains in place until April 30, but as mentioned, some smaller establishments will be able to get up and running before then.

“In the same way that we carefully closed businesses and urged operations to end to mitigate the virus’s spread, today, we are announcing plans to incrementally — and safely — reopen sectors of our economy,” Kemp said on Monday.

Many people in the state reacted with disbelief.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was surprised by Kemp’s announcement. “I have a great working relationship with our governor, but I did not speak with him before he made this announcement,” she said on Monday. She said she’d spoken to other mayors who were equally “perplexed” by the situation. “As I look at the data and as I talk with our local public health officials, I don’t see that it’s based on anything that’s logical.”

Kelly Girtz, the mayor of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, warned that some of the high-contact environments Kemp was allowing to open “are exactly the kind of places that we need to have maintain closure for the moment.” Girtz is encouraging constituents to continue to stay home and not reopen.

Despite criticism, Kemp appears determined to move forward. “We took measured steps to get the shelter in place, and now we’re taking measured steps to come out of that,” he said on Tuesday. “This is not a giant leap forward.”

At a press conference on Tuesday, President Donald Trump offered his support to Kemp. “He’s a very capable man. He knows what he’s doing,” he said, adding he’d be speaking to the governor “in a little while.” Then on Wednesday, the president said he “strongly” disagrees with Kemp’s decision.

Kemp’s coronavirus response hasn’t exactly been exemplary. He was slow to issue a stay-at-home order in the first place, and he only did so after claiming to have just learned asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 was possible, even though it’s a possibility scientists flagged months before.

It is also unclear what data and expertise is behind Kemp’s decision-making. Georgia has had more than 20,000 reported cases of the coronavirus, and more than 800 people have died of the disease there.

Dennis Miller, a hairdresser at Hello Gorgeous in Savannah, says he’s listening to his mayor over the governor on when to go back, and his friends are doing the same. “Kemp just figured things out when everybody else in the general public knew it for two-and-a-half weeks, so his lightbulb isn’t too bright, if there is a lightbulb,” he told me.

Miller, 60, has been licensed in cosmetology since 1978 and also dealt with Kemp when he was secretary of state overseeing the state board of cosmetology and barbers. “He did some real stupid things there, too.”

Just because Kemp says Georgia is open for business doesn’t mean it really is

Kemp allowing businesses to reopen does not mean all of them will, nor does it mean people will go out to frequent them.

Jennifer Franco, a massage therapist in Woodstock, Atlanta, told me she won’t be going back to work this month, adding that the minimum basic operations guidelines are laughable. “The basic requirement of our job is to touch people,” she said. The shop where she practices isn’t planning to open until mid-May, but even if the timeline speeds up, she won’t take clients, many of whom are over the age of 50. “I know them well and I wouldn’t want to risk infecting any of them,” she said.

Franco, 39, told me that it appeared many businesses in her area were going to remain closed until at least May. Even her local Planet Fitness told her they didn’t have an opening date.

Kenya Nelson, a personal trainer in Atlanta, told me she plans to continue to shelter in place until June or July and won’t be returning to the space she rents at a local gym in her area. One fitness coach in a more rural, conservative part of Georgia said his gym took a poll and decided not to open up, though most other gyms in the area are. “We’re taking a LOT of heat for the decision in our community,” he said in an email.

Businesses deciding not to open back up, workers deciding not to go back to work, and people deciding to stay home anyway expose a wrinkle in Kemp’s reopening plan: It’s tough to get back to business as usual when people are terrified of getting sick and dying in a global pandemic. Of course, plenty of people will venture out, but a lot of people will, at the very least, think twice about it.

As Vox’s Matt Yglesias recently explained, Trump, Republican governors, and whoever else declaring the economy open can’t force people back into restaurants:

The problem is a question of fear. Americans fear spreading or contracting infection, so much so that they’ve overwhelmingly participated in social distancing measures. They tell pollsters by wide margins that they fear lifting those restrictions too soon much more so than too late. They’re willing to stay put even if it harms the economy. They also fear economic hardship. That’s led prudent people, even those left relatively unharmed by the downturn so far, to delay nonessential purchases, like new cars, appliances, clothes, and other goods.

In the meantime, Kemp has imposed extra stress on people by forcing this decision on them. Imagine you’re a Georgia worker now expected to go back on the job. Do you stay home, forgo your livelihood, and hope an unemployment check comes in? Or do you go in and hope not to get sick?

It’s hard to make a plan when there is no plan

To be sure, Gov. Kemp and Georgia are hardly alone in nudging toward reopening the economy, even though the coronavirus crisis is hardly settled. Multiple states are beginning to move in that direction, and people are getting antsy.

States such as Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, and others testing the waters may start to show what the path ahead looks like. But they may also reveal that the country really is a long way away from having this figured out.

The country is still a long way away from the levels of mass testing experts believe are needed to start to move forward — they believe at least 500,000 tests a day are needed, and less than a third of that, tops, is being done. And even then, there’s contact tracing, enforcing quarantines, and multiple other questions that may not have even been thought of yet. As Vox’s Ezra Klein recently wrote, there is no plan to return to normal, at least not yet. And a vaccine is probably a long way away.

It’s more than understandable to want to get the economy reopened and get back to life as it used to be. And with at least 26 million Americans filing new jobless claims over the last five weeks and the economy headed into a deep recession, the situation can feel especially urgent. Folks need to get back to work to survive. The problem is, if states don’t get this right, people seem destined for waves of lockdowns and reopenings for many months, if not years.

Is Georgia getting this right? No one knows. But we’re about to find out.

"['Katherine Harmon Courage', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Coronavirus symptoms: How asymptomatic people are spreading the virus,"We know that not everyone who comes into contact with the novel coronavirus ends up getting sick. But just how many people out there have the virus and are feeling fine — and are perhaps unknowingly spreading it to others?

New data suggests it could be a lot.

For example, 60 percent of personnel aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt who tested positive for the coronavirus appeared healthy at the time, Reuters reported. Other data — from Iceland and elsewhere — have uncovered similar patterns.

With testing capacity still limited, most governments continue to focus on people who are showing symptoms of Covid-19 so that they can be isolated. This is important for slowing the virus’s spread. But it also means that globally, we have lagged in finding people who are carrying the virus but aren’t currently sick — and might be spreading it.

Related What to do if you have symptoms of the new coronavirus

(The early evidence that seemingly healthy people can still infect others with the coronavirus is one of the main reasons behind the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation that everyone wear a mask in public: so that people who don’t know they have the virus don’t accidentally infect others with it.)

So the big question everyone — including infectious disease experts — has is: How big of a role are these “silent spreaders” playing in this pandemic? It’s certainly significant.

People who feel fine are spreading the coronavirus

Throughout the pandemic, public health officials have focused on the advice that people who have symptoms of Covid-19 should self-isolate. This is crucial, to be sure. But it is also becoming “increasingly clear that there are people who are either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic who can transmit” the virus, Carlos del Rio, chair of the Department of Global Health at Emory University, told Vox.

In fact, people can start transmitting the virus 24 to 48 hours before they start showing symptoms, he said in a briefing for the Infectious Disease Society of America.

This timing detail is no small matter. And new research on presymptomatic transmission in people who did eventually experience symptoms underscores why.

People were most infectious right before they started to show symptoms

A study in Nature Medicine of 94 confirmed Covid-19 patients found that people were most infectious right before they started to show symptoms. The researchers obtained data about people who had gotten Covid-19 as well as those who had been around them before and after they got sick. Based on this, they estimated that 44 percent of people who caught the virus from the study’s participants had gotten it from people who felt healthy at the time.

They also found that someone who is mildly sick could have been just as contagious as someone with more severe symptoms. Maybe they aren’t coughing as much as someone feeling more seriously ill, but the virus can still spread through talking, sneezing, and coughing.



And what about people who are carrying the virus but don’t ever get sick — the true asymptomatic carriers? Can they spread it, too?

We simply don’t know yet. Hopefully, further studies will figure this out, because it could lead to more informed decisions about how to eventually end the pandemic.

How many people are carrying the coronavirus and don’t know it?

A new study out of Iceland, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, offers important insight about how prevalent asymptomatic carriers may be. Iceland has tested 6 percent of the entire island nation’s population — the most testing per capita of any country so far.

Part of the study tested those ill with Covid-19 symptoms, but another part involved testing a substantial sample of the general population feeling well — or at least with no greater symptoms than a mild common cold. Of those who tested positive for the virus, 43 percent were asymptomatic. So it’s possible that, at least in Iceland at that point in time, almost half of the people who had coronavirus didn’t know it.

This percentage likely varies from place to place, depending on the timing and severity of the current outbreak.

For example, two New York City hospitals recently tested more than 99 percent of women who delivered babies in their wards over the course of two weeks. Of the 215 women, about 2 percent had Covid-19 symptoms (all of them tested positive for the virus). And about 14 percent of the symptom-free women also tested positive. This means that about 88 percent of people who had the virus in this group had no symptoms at the time of testing.

So one in eight women admitted to the labor and delivery wards — who seemed healthy — nevertheless was carrying the virus.

Although these studies looked at specific populations at specific points in time, they can provide a general idea of what might be going on elsewhere.

How many people catch the coronavirus and never get sick at all?

We know that people who get Covid-19 start feeling sick anywhere from two to 14 days after they first catch the virus. But there also seems to be a subset of people who test positive for it but never develop any symptoms.

This isn’t that unusual. Other viruses often have many people carrying them who don’t get sick. For example, a study in the UK found that about 77 percent of people who had had the current flu strain never got sick (some studies have pointed to lower rates, which also shows how little we know even about common illnesses).

For the norovirus, a common stomach bug, about a third of people who get it don’t become ill — but can still transmit it to others.

And that number is even higher for other viruses, like polio, which only causes illness in some 5 to 10 percent of infections — but the asymptomatic carriers can still spread it to others, who might get the full-blown disease.

For SARS-CoV-2, the World Health Organization cited the statistic that about 75 percent of people who seem asymptomatic when they test positive for the virus eventually go on to develop symptoms of Covid-19. And a series of recent reports have backed that up.

One study, which examined a nursing home in Washington state early on in the coronavirus outbreak, found that more than half of residents who tested positive (57 percent) had no signs of the illness. One week later, however, more than three-quarters of them had developed symptoms.

The mean time for them to have started feeling sick was just three days after they had gotten tested. This shows just how narrow of a window one-shot testing can be.

Another study, which looked at passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also tried to account for this timing issue. Initial data showed that of the 634 people on board who tested positive for the coronavirus, slightly more than half were asymptomatic at the time. But researchers were able to follow up with these people (after many did eventually get sick) and, based on that data, estimated that the actual rate of asymptomatic infections was about 18 percent.

And 18 percent is still a large number, especially when expanded to a broader population during an outbreak. That’s roughly one in five people. And based on the WHO numbers, it is one in four.

Researchers still don’t know if — and how much — these truly asymptomatic carriers might be contributing to the spread of the virus. But with such large numbers, answering that question (and taking precautionary actions in the meantime) will be essential to understanding how to most effectively slow down this pandemic.

Identifying silent spreaders is essential

Given that roughly three-quarters of people who don’t show symptoms at the time of testing will probably get ill (and that those people are perhaps most infectious just before they start feeling sick) and given that we still don’t know how much asymptomatic individuals are infecting others, limiting the spread of the virus by seemingly healthy people is crucial.

That is one of the reasons large-scale testing is so powerful. For example, in the Iceland study, public health officials were able to identify about 525 people — in a country of just 364,000 — who were carrying the virus but appeared healthy otherwise (that would be the equivalent of finding about 473,000 asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers in a small sampling in the US, population-wise).

This information allowed Icelandic officials to take action. After positive test results, people were required to self-isolate until they tested negative — “and all contacts of these participants were [also] required to self-quarantine for 2 weeks,” the authors noted. This sort of broad testing and targeted isolation strategy could help curb the spread of the virus and allow more people to continue with less severe social distancing restrictions.

We’ll need more widespread antibody testing to better understand what’s going on

The trouble with so many of these numbers is that they are snapshots in time. And detailed follow-up, like what happened in the Diamond Princess study, is resource-intensive.

This is one of the reasons testing for the presence of the coronavirus is not — and cannot — give us a clear picture of its true prevalence. Just as it might catch someone before the onset of their symptoms, it might miss someone who has already fought the virus off, whether they knew it or not.

That’s why more widespread antibody testing to see if someone has had the virus in the past will be key in determining the actual proportion of the population that has had the virus. (Most current testing is a different method that looks for the presence of the virus during an active infection.)

With that number, experts will also be able to start modeling how many asymptomatic people are contributing to the overall spread of the virus. This will be “critically important” for ascertaining if they “may be sustaining viral transmission,” del Rio said.

(But this will need to be done thoughtfully. There has been substantial debate over, for example, a recent estimate, based on antibody testing, that the prevalence of the virus in Santa Clara County, California, might be 50-85 times higher than the number of rapid test-confirmed cases.)

Better understanding the true number of asymptomatic carriers and their potential to infect others could impact everything from public health guidelines to how soon we can begin to safely resume more normal activities.

The National Institutes of Health is launching a large-scale study to look at this now. It is enrolling up to 10,000 volunteers from anywhere in the US to be tested for antibodies to the coronavirus.

“These crucial data will help us measure the impact of our public health efforts now and guide our Covid-19 response moving forward,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a statement. You can learn more about enrolling here.

In the meantime, all of these mounting data support continued social distancing practices, mask-wearing, and other preventative measures for everyone — no matter how healthy they feel.

Correction, April 22: An earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of asymptomatic people in an Iceland study who tested positive for Covid-19.

"['German Lopez', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Why US jails and prisons became coronavirus epicenters,"America’s jails and prisons have become epicenters in the coronavirus pandemic.

At Illinois’s Cook County Jail (which serves Chicago), some inmates refused to eat noncommissary food to protest conditions they claimed enabled the spread of the coronavirus. The New York Times found earlier this month that the Cook County Jail outbreak, which has sickened nearly 400 detainees and almost 200 correctional officers, made it “the nation’s largest-known source of coronavirus infections.”

In Rikers Island in New York City, the jail’s top doctor called the coronavirus outbreak there — one of the largest in the country, with hundreds sick — a “public health disaster unfolding before our eyes.” As of April 20, the confirmed infection rate in New York City jails was more than 9 percent, compared to less than 2 percent in New York City more broadly, according to the Legal Aid Society.

In Michigan’s Parnall Correctional Facility, 10 percent of prisoners and 21 percent of staff tested positive for the coronavirus as of April 15, according to the Detroit Free Press. When controlling for population, that makes the outbreak there even worse than Cook County’s or Rikers Island’s.

In Ohio, more than one in five of the state’s confirmed cases are in the prison system, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The Marion Correctional Institution, where 73 percent of inmates tested positive for the virus, makes up a majority of those cases.

The federal prison system hasn’t been spared either, with several deaths and and at least 100 inmates and staff members infected just in FCC Oakdale in Louisiana.

Jails and prisons are ideal environments for an infectious disease to spread. They are, by design, often packed as much as possible, thus limiting the possibility of social distancing. They also severely limit access to hygiene products — the sheriff in Cook County had to proactively let inmates use sanitizer, which is normally prohibited due to its alcohol content, and soap and water can be hard to get. Even among staff, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks remains difficult to access.

The outbreaks are concerning not just because of the impact they can have on inmates, staff members, and their families, but also because the events can spill over beyond the correctional facilities. Millions of inmates go in and out of prisons, and particularly jails, each year, returning to their communities. Staff members go home at the end of their shifts. Inmates’ family members can visit — although that’s become much harder, if not impossible, due to the pandemic.

And if there’s an outbreak in a jail or prison, it can strain nearby health care systems as inmates and staff are sent to local hospitals and clinics that are better equipped to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, than correctional facilities.

So to get the coronavirus pandemic under control, experts say, the nation will need to get outbreaks in jails and prisons under control, too. This means releasing more vulnerable and less dangerous inmates early, as some jails and prisons have been doing. It means making sure inmates and staff have better access to hygiene products and PPE. It means a change in how jails and prisons fundamentally operate — allowing more room for social distancing and quarantining, or otherwise isolating inmates and staff when necessary.

Jails and prisons create a coronavirus threat to whole communities

Many countries are facing new challenges in their jails and prisons due to the coronavirus pandemic. But the US is unique, because mass incarceration has led to millions of people being incarcerated across thousands of jails, prisons, and other correctional facilities in the country — any of which could become hotbeds for disease.

The US locks up about 2.3 million people on any given day — the highest prison and jail population of any country in the world. With an incarceration rate of 655 per 100,000 people, the US incarcerates people at nearly twice the rate of Russia, more than five times that of China, more than six times that of Canada and France, nearly nine times that of Germany, and almost 17 times that of Japan.

“We can learn what works in terms of mitigation from other countries who have seen spikes in coronavirus already, but none of those countries have the level of incarceration that we have in the United States,” Tyler Winkelman, a doctor and researcher at the University of Minnesota focused on health care and criminal justice, told me.

It’s not just the number of people in jail and prison, but the number going in and out of them, too. Jails in the US alone admit upwards of 5 million unique people each year, releasing many of those same people back to the community within days or weeks. There are also visitors and correctional staff who interact — sometimes in very limited spaces — with inmates. Any of these people can bring the virus in and take it out.

The US locks up about 2.3 million people on any given day — the highest prison and jail population of any country in the world.

“Jails pull together people from many neighborhoods, put them all together in cramped, unsanitary conditions, and then very quickly release them back to the same communities,” John Pfaff, a criminal justice expert at Fordham University, told me. “They’re a very powerful centralizing and diffusing vector of disease. That alone should grab people’s attention.”

No other country faces a risk quite like this. Even the states that incarcerate the least number of people in the US still lock up far more people than the vast majority of other countries: In 2018, the Prison Policy Initiative estimated that the incarceration rate of Massachusetts, the least carceral state, was more than double that of England and Wales, and nearly triple that of South Korea.

So a prison outbreak would present a potentially deadly risk to a relatively massive population, which, on top of everything else, disproportionately suffers from chronic illnesses and other health conditions that could exacerbate Covid-19.

There are also big racial disparities in jails or prisons, which, if those people are released back to their own communities, could further worsen already bad outbreaks in minority communities.

Jails and prisons present an elevated risk for other types of facilities and institutions. Winkelman, who works in the Hennepin County Jail and local homeless shelters, noted that there is a lot of overlap between jailed and homeless populations. Someone released from a jail, then, could infect people in a homeless shelter, or vice versa, causing an outbreak that could bounce back and forth between both places, infecting far more people than would be in a jail or homeless shelter alone.

But even if an outbreak is contained to a jail or prison, the effects could spill over outside.

“All of these mitigation strategies — of closing schools, stopping conferences, decreasing travel — are to slow the speed at which people get the virus so that we don’t overwhelm our health care system,” Winkelman said. “If Covid spreads in a large, thousand-person facility, and within five days you have a thousand people with multiple chronic conditions who just got the virus, that has the potential to really overwhelm a health care system.”

One problem is that jails and prisons notoriously do a bad job of providing health care to inmates. As a CNN investigation last year revealed, these facilities often deny or delay even basic medical care, causing preventable complications and deaths. In the context of Covid-19, those kinds of delays could mean more time for a sick inmate to infect others.

This is in part by design: To get to prison doctors and nurses, inmates usually have to go through guards who often have different priorities.

“The system of care that exists around any given person, whether they’re incarcerated or not, is not just doctors or nurses, but it’s also the people who are in their immediate vicinity and taking care of them on a day-to-day basis,” Wanda Bertram, communications strategist for the Prison Policy Initiative, told me. “That’s why it really matters when those people are family members as opposed to when those people are correctional staff, who think of you as a threat.”

People in jail or prison also have less access to things people might otherwise take for granted that help prevent the spread of infection.

“If you spend even just a couple of minutes in any jail or prison area, you would quickly find that many of the sinks there for handwashing don’t work, or that there are no paper towels or no soap,” Homer Venters, former chief medical officer for New York City Correctional Health Services, told the Brennan Center, a criminal justice reform group. “In other words, handwashing, the most basic tool that incarcerated people have, won’t be consistently available. Jail and prison administrators should be thinking right now about how they can put more infection control measures into place very quickly.”

Jails and prisons are taking action — but they could do much more

Some jails and prisons are already taking steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They’ve banned visits. They’ve released inmates early. They’ve tried to separate inmates out more; in Cook County, for example, detainees are now mostly placed in single cells instead of with a cellmate.

But problems remain. In Washington, DC, for example, inmates sued over conditions in jail, including a lack of soap and paper towels. The correctional officers union — typically at odds with inmates — joined the lawsuit against DC’s Department of Corrections. A judge ultimately denied inmates’ requests for an early release, but did order better protections against Covid-19, including more social distancing and improved tracking of symptoms.

“Mostly what we’ve seen are more grudging efforts,” Pfaff said. “I don’t think any place is doing great.”

But with coronavirus outbreaks now happening across the US, this is something, experts argue, that all jails and prisons should at least be preparing for, if not taking concrete steps to prevent.

“Jails and prisons should really have a sense that they’re almost overreacting,” Winkelman said, echoing what other experts have said about dealing with Covid-19 in general. “That’s probably going to be what the right move is.”

To that end, Winkelman said that guidance from the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, released early in the US’s Covid-19 outbreak when Washington state was among the first hit, still holds up.

One recommendation: release some inmates. “Are there people you can release on their own recognizance? Do you have a priority list (who do you release if you need to downsize by 5%? 10%? etc.)?” the guidance asked. “Are there alternatives to arrest for certain crimes, or, in dire situations, are there crimes for which your patrol division will not arrest?” Another possibility is a furlough, in which some inmates are released temporarily, particularly those who are older and have health conditions that could make Covid-19 more dangerous.

Some jails and prisons are taking steps along these lines, but experts caution that this is something, again, that all jails and prisons should consider. If a key measure to beating the spread of Covid-19 is physical distancing, then making sure that jails and prisons aren’t as packed should help. One poll by Data for Progress suggested, too, that a majority of likely voters backs early release of at least some inmates to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

Part of the challenge may be that early release isn’t only up to jails and prisons, Pfaff said: “The leniency requires every step of the process to buy into it. If you have the sheriffs on board, but the judges don’t agree, it’s going to be hard to get people out. If the judges are on board, but the sheriffs aren’t, it’s going to hard to get people out. You need everyone to come together to get people out — and it’s often very hard to get that unified response.”

Jails and prisons could also aggressively test to gauge the scope of their outbreaks and catch early warning signs of an epidemic. They could make soap and hand sanitizer easier to obtain. They could move visitations to phone and video conferences. They could guarantee paid sick leave to staff — helping ensure that staff stay home when they’re sick — and encourage staff to work from home when possible.

“If you’re going to keep people contained, at least make it possible for them to clean their hands and give them face masks or something they can wear,” Pfaff said.

At the same time, it’s important for jails and prisons to not get too carried away, including with inmates who prove to be sick.

“Inmates in isolation should have ample access to comfort, entertainment, and activity-related materials allowed by their custody level,” the guidance from the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs explained. “An important reason for this suggestion is that you want to do everything possible to encourage inmates to notify medical staff as early as possible if they experience symptoms of infection. Fear of being placed in an overly-restrictive cell may delay their notification, which is counterproductive.”

Above all, though, jails and prisons should take the coronavirus as a serious threat — not just to themselves, but to the greater public, too — and work with public health officials accordingly.

“It’s an exaggerated version of what we talk about all the time when we talk about the public health impact of mass incarceration — when we say that this is not just something that puts incarcerated people in danger but something that puts whole communities in danger,” Bertram argued. “You’re creating hotbeds of illness, and you’re creating damage that’s eventually going to have to be borne by these people and their families once they’re released. So it’s really a concern for everyone.”

"['Alex Abad-Santos', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,"How Alison Roman became the reluctant, pasta-loving “prom queen of the pandemic”","People talk about pastry chef turned Bon Appétit editor turned New York Times food columnist Alison Roman’s recipes like they talk about pop stars. Despite the countless forms of pasta, stews, and cookies, Roman’s fans don’t need to look for anything beyond their general name. Roman’s recipes are the singular, ultimate form. The Stew. The Cookies. The Pasta.

If you’ve logged on to Instagram over the past two years, perhaps you’ve seen posts or stories from one of your friends’ attempts to make one of Roman’s iconic meals — a sunshine-yellow, turmeric-spiced stew; a brick-red jam of a pasta sauce; a stout, thick cookie sporting chunks of chocolate and the faintest flakes of sea salt.

She’s not just a familiar name to readers of The New York Times Cooking section; she’s also a social media mainstay, with her recipes seemingly everywhere, shared and photographed by almost everyone you know.

But during this pandemic and the shelter-in-place directives in effect nationwide, Roman and her recipes have further exploded in popularity.

“On the one hand, I’m so happy to be ‘prom queen of the pandemic,’” Roman told me over the phone, wryly accepting the relationship between her surge in ubiquity and people being locked inside all day. “But on the other hand, are people going to forever associate me with the darkest time in their lives?”

Roman couldn’t have predicted this situation, nor that it would inspire many of us to cook from home with her help in particular. But her influence has been building since she published her first cookbook, Dining In, in 2017 and her 2019 follow-up, Nothing Fancy, and her wide presence across the internet exemplifies what makes her and her recipes so beloved, regardless of circumstance.

Roman doesn’t cook to entertain or impress others, or as a rare special occasion. Her recipes are made to be simple, to be delicious, and even to be eaten alone. And to someone stuck at home who doesn’t want all the fuss that can come with cooking, Roman is offering one less thing to worry about: what to eat.

Roman approaches cooking as a way to feed yourself deliciously

Until my dying day, I pledge my sword and shield to the one and only Ina “Barefoot Contessa” Garten. Garten is a Food Network icon, admired and envied by fans for her wealthy, elegant lifestyle and the delicious, butter-drenched food she makes.

Garten lives in the ritzy beach town of East Hampton, New York, cooks in a beautiful kitchen, is always hosting dinner parties, and prefers to use the finest ingredients. The running joke among fans of Garten’s TV shows is that she’ll instruct them to use something highly specific, like 30-year-old, Grey Goose-based, homemade vanilla extract, but then say “store-bought is fine” — that is, fine for the normies who could never dream of achieving Garten’s level of fabulousness.

To Alison Roman, however, store-bought is more than enough.

“The recipes in this book follow my general approach, in that I would never ask you to toast nine different hard-to-locate spices on a Monday after work, and I’d never suggest you make something that takes two-and-a-half hours if there were a simpler and equally delicious way to do it in one,” Roman writes in the introduction of her 2017 cookbook Dining In. “I’ve been calling these recipes ‘highly cookable,’ meaning they’re easy to shop for, simple to execute, and a joy to eat.”

Roman is the realist inverse of Garten. She’s a 34-year-old millennial living in Brooklyn whose home kitchen looks like it could maybe fit five people, standing shoulder to shoulder. But while Garten-like dinner parties for fabulous friends might not be Roman’s reality, making food in a tiny space without a farmhouse sink or near-endless counter space is more relatable.

Roman wants to teach people how to cook — simply, realistically, and confidently.

In past interviews, she’s mentioned that the best parts of her experience working at famed eateries like New York’s Momofuku Milk Bar, Brooklyn’s Pies ‘n’ Thighs, and San Francisco’s Quince weren't giving diners the most memorable meals they’ve ever had (although that happened a lot, according to the restaurants’ reviews). Rather, Roman loved mentoring the kitchens’ rookies.

That comes through in her recipes and her cookbooks as well as the image she’s cultivated during this pandemic. She’s made herself accessible to burgeoning fans during quarantine on social media platforms like Twitter, where Roman has conducted Ask Me Anything sessions for people to raise any cooking questions they have. Those questions range from what to do with ground beef to the best way to cook rice to how to deal with leftovers.

“I think it’s a little lame, but, I think [teaching and cooking] really is, like, my love language — like, acts of servitude,” she told me. “I really like doing nice things for people, and there’s so much I can’t do right now. So I think that just being able to help people [cook], as a thing I can do, it makes me feel useful. It makes me feel like I still have something to provide.”

It’s Roman’s famous caramelized shallot pasta, a.k.a. the Pasta, that crystallizes her accessible approach to home cooking into one astonishingly delicious, efficient, and fast dish.

The Pasta isn’t famed for the noodles themselves. The appeal lies in a glossy scarlet sauce conjured from a mountain of shallots, garlic, tomato paste, anchovy bodies, and pasta water. Roman has said that the sauce’s appearance reminds her of Spaghettios, but that the depth of flavor is as good as, if not better than, your typical marinara sauce.

As an Ina Garten aficionado who’s been taught that good home-cooked meals take at least an hour and a chunk of a paycheck, I was initially skeptical about this internet-famous recipe. This was the case despite many of my friends successfully making the Pasta in the past several weeks, all of whom documented their respective journeys on Instagram and praised the recipe afterward.

My susceptibility to peer pressure finally did me in. I decided to try making the Pasta — to eat it and understand it.

Dear lord please let me get through this pandemic without a backlash, my shallot pasta popularity is all I have in these dark times https://t.co/KIot7tw7OB — alison roman (@alisoneroman) April 7, 2020

There are 10 official ingredients in the dish and household staples — olive oil, pasta (any kind works), garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and tomato paste — make up the majority of them. Roman says the recipe takes an approximate 40 minutes, equivalent to one episode of any Real Housewives franchise. A huge chunk of that time is spent chopping up six shallots and stirring said shallots alongside garlic so they don’t burn. Eventually, as I melted the tomato paste and anchovies into the shallots, I scanned the steps one more time and saw that Roman says to halve the paste to save for later.

I cocked an eyebrow. I felt bamboozled.

Apparently, this shallot-garlic-anchovy jam was going to feed me for multiple meals, including the one I was having that night. It would apparently be something I wanted to, as Roman writes, smear onto “another batch of pasta or ... onto roasted vegetables, spooned over fried eggs or spread underneath crispy chicken thighs.”

Trudging on with guarded optimism, I added the pasta and a cup of reserved pasta water to the jam. Like Roman said it would, the mixture transformed into an unctuous, earthy, blanket of a sauce that elevated my humble ziti into primi piatti.

Sorcery, I thought, as I fantasized what this sauce would be like on eggs, with sausage, on hearty fish, on toast.

It’s not an Alison Roman recipe until someone Instagrams it

On January 29, 2020, Roman posted a picture of the famed Pasta on Instagram. To date, that post has more than 31,000 likes; Roman herself has over 513,000 followers. Fans of the Pasta have used the hashtag #ThePasta, which pulls up more than 900 tagged posts, to show off their own attempts to recreate the dish.

While it seems like so many people are talking about Roman’s recipes right now, this isn’t Roman’s first mainstream breakthrough.

Back in 2017, Roman achieved social media fame thanks to a cookie — the Cookie. It’s a highly photogenic shortbread and chocolate chunk cookie with sea salt flakes that thrived on social media and food-centric places online.

Everyone is entitled to their own cookie preferences. The United States is a free country. But I don’t know anyone who could look at the picture above and not want one of those cookies in their mouth immediately. If I were a better baker or had any interest in learning the magic of baking, I would want to try making them for myself.

People who were more daring than me wanted to see for themselves whether the Cookies tasted as good as they looked. So they tried making them over and over, and photographed them over and over and over. Each time people weighed in on whether the famed cookies lived up to the massive hype — #TheCookie hashtag has more than 9,000 posts, the majority of which are Roman recreations; #TheCookies has over 6,000 posts, with Roman’s being the singular cookie.

“There was some contention around the cookies,” Roman told Vox in a 2019 interview. “People were like, is this better [than regular chocolate chip cookies]? Is it worth it? People were kind of mad about the cookies! So I think a lot of people made it because it was a social conversation: People wanted to weigh in on whether or not they thought it was better, and try it for themselves, go up against other cookies — it was a whole thing.”

The same is now true of the Pasta, three years later. The more people posted about their attempts, the more it seemed like making it was a dare that couldn’t be ignored. I wanted to see if the recipe lived up to the hype and taste just how good it was, since everyone on my timeline had been talking about the Pasta like it was a rite of passage.

When I made it, I realized that shallots (one of Roman’s staples) are aesthetically superior to onions, because they’re cute and purple. I initially wasn’t going to photograph them (I don’t really like posting pics of food online), but they were melting so beautifully that I felt the urge to show people that I, too, was embarking on the Roman pasta journey. And that the journey was beautiful.

this lady asked for a lot of shallots pic.twitter.com/24LlHVlCSQ — stan of cleves (@alex_abads) April 7, 2020

Roman also features people’s triumphant attempts to make her recipes on her own accounts. Her active social media presence, along with the viral-friendly aesthetic nature of her cookies and pasta and other dishes, encourages people to post their results and keep posting them. And in turn, more and more people see the food she’s making — especially on platforms like the New York Times Cooking’s Instagram with its 2.1 million followers — and want to try it for themselves.

The photogenic aspect of Roman’s recipes is crucial, in that no one wants to share they made an inelegant cookie, messy stew, or unsightly pasta sauce. If something’s delicious, people will make it. If something’s delicious and looks good on Instagram, many more people will make it.

I asked Roman how the aesthetics of food factor into recipe-making. Figuring that she was a pastry chef and knowing how important looks are to pastries, I expected a different answer than the one she gave.

“I never, ever [create a recipe] with the interest of it looking good,” she tells me and goes on to giggle while explaining the origin story of the cauliflower pasta recipe that she says she almost cut from her book, because it looked way less attractive than her usual blog-worthy fare.

“I almost didn’t publish that, because I was like, ‘This is hideous,’” she says. “It’s like a bowl of creamy beige bullshit. Like, what the fuck is this? And it still is one of [my] most popular recipes of the past year.”

Roman says there’s a slight caveat when it comes to beauty and food: Food naturally looks good, no matter what.

“I think that food is inherently beautiful,” she says, describing a perfectly browned, skin-on chicken thigh as an example. “I think that ingredients are gorgeous. And I think cooking, when done properly, is going to give you a beautiful result.”

Thinking about Roman’s words, I flashed back to my own experience with the Pasta. As an infrequent cook in my kitchen, I am sure some of my friends figured that if someone as allergic to cooking as I am can make delicious shallot-and-anchovy pasta look beautiful, then they could easily do it themselves. And it definitely looked beautiful, even with my ziti.

Roman’s cooking dovetails with the circumstances of the pandemic

What makes Roman’s cooking so appealing to everyone in this moment — not just her devout fan base — is that her recipes are simple. Grocery trips in the age of coronavirus are daunting, because any trip outside of your home increases your risk of being exposed. In order to minimize that risk, you should be as efficient as possible when you go to the store. And there’s a premium on ingredients that have multiple purposes, especially since a grocery’s inventory at this time can be so unpredictable.

Roman recipes are built around a few core ingredients that you may already find in your pantry. Since the quarantine began, I've realized that I am the proud owner of two bottles of crushed red pepper flakes and three bottles of dried oregano. Most of her other staples, save for maybe kimchi, are usually in stock at any grocery.

Olive oil

Lemons

Fresh herbs (parsley/cilantro/dill)

Alliums (garlic/shallot/onion)

Dried or canned beans/chickpeas

Canned tomatoes/tomato paste

Crushed red pepper flakes

Anchovies

Parmesan

Soy sauce

Eggs

Yogurt/labne/sour cream

Pickles/kimchi for snacking https://t.co/Rob18a9Z0B — alison roman (@alisoneroman) March 12, 2020

Roman also lives in Brooklyn, and has said she calibrated her techniques for people who don’t have elaborate kitchens or pantries, and people with tiny sinks — like a lot of people in New York City or any other major metropolitan area. Most of the cooking happens in one or two pots, and there’s hardly ever extra cleanup beyond washing the cutting board and a few dishes.

There are so many young people sheltering place who live in major cities that have been shut down. And many of those people, including me, are used to frequently having lunch or dinner out or grabbing takeout. We’re the ones who will always prefer recipes that are streamlined and don’t require tons of fridge space or tools (sorry, Ina) to ones that depend on the chaos of appliances, mixers, pots, and pans.

In a world where there’s so much uncertainty, quarantine or no, the fewer decisions one has to make, the better. With Roman’s approach to food, she’s taken out all the guesswork and maximizes the ingredients she asks for.

That efficiency shouldn’t be mistaken for a lack of effort.

“I don’t want to ever be perceived as being a lazy cooker, cutting corners,” Roman said, citing her 15 years of experience. “I think the reason I am able to do all that is because I already know the outcome of doing it the hard way. I’ve done it the hard way. I’ve done it with more ingredients, I’ve done it with more time, I’ve done it with more staff. It’s not better than this way, is my rationale.”

Roman’s popularity will probably only increase during this pandemic as people look for good recipes with minimal ingredients and spend time on their screens and social media more than ever.

And with her star rising once again, Roman’s renewed clout has been ripe for parody, or at least Twitter jokes. A byproduct of having so much hype is backlash — something that Roman seems to both welcome and view with chagrin.

“I’m not trying to win a competition,” she tells me. “But, like, if something were bad, why would everyone be talking about it?”

She pauses and lets her question linger in the air.

“Maybe you don’t like it, but that doesn’t mean that it’s not good. You know, food is so subjective, and people want to tear it down if it’s become too popular. But if it wasn’t good, it would never have become popular.”

Thanks to the internet and social media, anything “cool,” including the Pasta, is just minutes away from being loved by fans and scrutinized by haters. And there are worse things than a little resentment — like a bad pasta sauce.

"['Matthew Yglesias', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Will the worst downturn since the Great Depression last as long?,"Weeks of record job losses have left the United States with an unemployment rate that’s widely estimated to be higher than at any time since the Great Depression.

That shocking reality naturally invites analogies and raises what is perhaps the most important economic question of our time: How long will the bad times last? After all, what made the Great Depression so great was not just the severity of the slump but its extraordinary length — beginning in the United States in the second half of 1929 and not really ending until almost 10 years later.

Policymakers are hoping that the modern economy will come roaring back when things “open up,” but disagree about when that can or should happen and exactly what it means. Although very severe recessions are sometimes short, America’s most recent recessions — even the milder ones — have tended to be long, and the most recent one was both long and deep.

A prolonged collapse akin to the Great Depression is by no means inevitable, but it’s not impossible either. The fate of the American economy will rest not just on the course of the virus but on economic policy choices. Will Congress and the Federal Reserve provide the kind of dramatic stimulus we need to return to full employment, or will they opt to just muddle through?

The Great Depression was really long

The most striking thing about the American economy in the 1930s is that the Depression went on and on and on. There are a few different ways you could look at this, but probably the simplest is to consider the unemployment rate.

Here’s a chart showing joblessness calculated in two ways. One is the official unemployment rate from Stanley Lebergott of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the other line is a more optimistic model constructed years later by economist Michael Darby, who argues that the official statistics of the day improperly classified people with unemployment relief jobs as not working. The Lebergott-Darby gap of roughly 5 percentage points makes a difference, but either way, it’s a long depression.

Even using Darby’s numbers, the unemployment rate never got low during President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal programs. After getting steadily worse under President Herbert Hoover in the early 1930s, the economy got better under Roosevelt, which is why he won reelection overwhelmingly in 1936. But things were still really bad during the New Deal’s best moments.

Then it got worse, because in 1937, the US stopped making progress and fell into a new recession within the depression. Policymakers corrected some of the errors that led to the 1937 recession (more on that later), and the unemployment rate started falling again.

But even by 1940, the labor market was still in shambles. It’s only the extraordinary events surrounding World War II that really brought the Depression to an end. And that resolution shows us two things.

One is that if politicians had been willing to try more drastic things earlier, they may have been able to generate the rapid recovery that took place in 1940 earlier, too. The other is that if war hadn’t broken out, the very modest and unsteady pace of recovery that was happening under Roosevelt might have just continued for years more. Nothing about the nature of an economy guarantees that it will “bounce back” from bad news.

But it does sometimes happen.

“V-shaped” recessions used to be common

Macroeconomic forecasters often talk about the idea of “V-shaped” recessions — recessions where a swift decline is followed by a swift recovery.

And America has had a lot of recessions like that. In July 1981 the unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, surging to 10.8 percent by December 1982, but then tumbling back to 7.2 percent by June 1984.

That was the worst of the V-shaped recessions, but they used to be fairly common — especially in the 20 years following the end of World War when we had four of them in a row. These recessions all have an underlying dynamic, where the Federal Reserve starts to worry that the economy is overheating and inflation is rising so they raise interest rates. Then interest-sensitive sectors of the economy rapidly start to shrink, and unemployment soars. When the time is right, the Fed flips the switch and things pick up again.

America’s more lingering recessions — like the one that sparked by the financial crisis but also the much more mild but annoyingly long-lasting one touched off by the collapse of the 1990s stock market bubble — tend to have more complicated dynamics. The Fed tries to fight them by cutting interest rates, but the Fed didn’t cause these recessions by raising rates, so taking them all the way down to zero doesn’t necessarily get the job done. Today, the Fed has already taken rates down to zero and the economy is still heading south, so there’s reason to worry that once again we won’t get a “V.”

But there’s also a case for optimism.

“Opening up the economy”

The recurrence of the phrase “opening up the economy” in contemporary politics reflects the view that current economic problems are caused by top-down closure orders. When restrictions are lifted, the hope is the economy will come roaring back.

With this view, you might see the economy as sort of like a spring. It’s been compressed, for now, for the sake of flattening the curve. But when pressure abates — whether because of policy shifts or medical breakthroughs — it’ll bounce right back. Former Treasury Secretary and National Economic Council director Lawrence Summers tentatively endorsed something like this view in early April, analogizing the current depression to a seasonal downturn or a long weekend. He acknowledged, though, that this was “only an optimistic guess” and he was “not sure” if it’s right.

I think that if we’re able to get the public health under control that normality will return more quickly than it does after financial crises or normal recessions, but I’m not sure of that. — Lawrence H. Summers (@LHSummers) April 3, 2020

The overall record of macroeconomic forecasting as a discipline is not very good, and in this case, economists are looking at a situation they have no real experience with.

And it’s certainly possible that this could prove correct. Simply proclaiming that America is back open for business is unlikely to produce a huge surge in growth, but real medical advances that put the public health crisis behind us could. You could imagine a tremendous amount of pent-up demand as a long-frustrated public goes out and does things they’ve been afraid or banned from doing for months.

There could also be a surge of optimism as people feel the American can-do spirit has triumphed against an “invisible enemy” and now is a great time to make risky bets on the future. Millions of Americans have been familiarizing themselves with new digital productivity tools during the extended work-from-home era and organizations may return to the post-Covid world stronger and more efficient for it.

All that said, historically speaking long downturns usually become long because they far outlast the events that precipitated them.

We have some scary precedents

The recent Great Recession is an unfortunate example of the problem.

The economy initially headed into what looked like a mild recession, driven by a decline in housebuilding activity associated with the fall in housing prices. But then came a severe financial crisis that sparked concerns about widespread bank failures or a total breakdown of the financial system. That plunged the country into what became an extremely severe recession over the winter of 2008-’09. But a range of emergency measures undertaken by the Federal Reserve and the US Congress successfully saved the financial system which, by mid-2009, was clearly not going to collapse. And, indeed, by the second half of 2009 the economy was growing again — just not fast enough.

Jobs came back, but at a much slower pace than they’d disappeared, giving the recession a prolonged and asymmetrical character. A financial breakdown caused the job losses, but fixing the financial breakdown didn’t cause a rapid bounce-back.

Making things worse, it took six years for total employment to return to its precrisis levels, and by the time it did, the US population had grown considerably. In 2015 and 2016, more Americans were working than at any previous time in history. But because the working-age population kept growing the labor market remained weak. It was really only in the 24 months before coronavirus arrived that the job market was finally functioning “normally” with workers quitting jobs at high rates, and employers experimenting with pay raises to retain staff or recruiting marginal candidates like ex-convicts and recovering addicts.

The shallow recession of the early 2000s was much less severe but had a similar quality — the recovery was much slower and weaker than the initial collapse, provoking much frustration. The common element that these two recessions share with the Great Depression is that none of them were deliberately provoked by a Federal Reserve trying to control inflation. Consequently in all three cases even though the Fed cut interest rates to try to help the economy, the switch couldn’t be flung hard enough to make the economy bounce back. What it took was either time or, in the case of the Depression, extraordinary measures.

Unconventional thinking ended the Depression

The Depression lasted a long time and the recovery was uneven, so there isn’t a single unitary explanation of what ended it. Instead, there were basically four prongs:

FDR took the United States off the gold standard, breaking with prevailing orthodoxy to devalue the dollar and helping to bolster the private sector recovery from 1933 to 1937.

Work-relief programs consistently knocked about 5 percentage points off the unemployment rate.

Fear of Hitler started causing Europeans to shift gold into the United States around 1938, providing additional monetary expansion that helped reverse the 1937 recession.

Finally, America geared up to enter World War II and then actually joined the war, causing a huge surge in deficit spending that finally generated full employment.

Conversely, in 1937, when public officials decided the recovery was underway and it was time to return to more conventional policy, everything slid back down quickly.

In retrospect, the United States almost certainly could have restored full employment in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis more rapidly had policymakers acted more forcefully in the spirit of 1933. What we got instead was a frustrated back-and-forth effort. Big fiscal stimulus in 2009, followed by significant austerity starting in 2011. Bold Federal Reserve initiatives like quantitative easing, alternating with statements about how eager the Fed was to return to normal.

The results were much better than in the Great Depression, but much worse than the recovery could have looked like.

The economy probably won’t revive on its own

The basic case for pessimism about the economy in the medium term is this: Most Americans are going to exit this crisis poorer than they were at the beginning, thanks to some combination of job loss, reduced hours, pay cuts, investment losses, lost tips, or reduced sales. People who have less money than they had before the crisis can’t simply “go back to normal” when the crisis is over, they need to deal with the fact that they are poorer now by restraining their spending. But because my spending is your income and vice-versa, that collective restraint will keep holding the economy back.

If the coronavirus crisis were a uniquely American phenomenon, Americans could get out of the jam by selling things to foreigners — but the whole world is basically in the same boat.

If interest rates were high, the Fed could make them low making debt more affordable and generating a surge of debt-financed activity — but rates were low when the crisis began and they’ve already been cut to zero.

That essentially leaves us where we were in the Great Depression, with an economy that’s going to be depressed simply because it’s been depressed. People with no money can’t buy things, and in a global downturn there’s nowhere to turn for customers. A solution would need to involve either unorthodox Federal Reserve actions — a search for a modern-day equivalent to abandoning the gold standard — or else the government serving as a customer of last resort, as it did during the lead-up to World War II.

To normalize the economy, it won’t be good enough to lift restrictions and address the underlying public health emergency, people are going to need sources of income. The federal government, which is uniquely positioned to spend much more than it takes in, can serve as that source of income. But for it to happen, politicians will need to avoid the kind of premature pivot to deficit reduction that happened in 2010 and 2011.

"['Katherine Harmon Courage', 'Apr']",2020-04-01,"The stark differences in countries’ coronavirus death rates, explained","The race to track and slow the coronavirus pandemic has been very much a numbers game.

While we watch the number of cases — and deaths — climb, experts also are closely eyeing what they call the case fatality rate (CFR). This tells the proportion of people who have been confirmed as having Covid-19 and ultimately die from the illness, and it’s a number that has been varying widely from country to country.

Some countries, such as Germany, have a fatality rate of approximately 3 percent of confirmed cases, whereas Italy’s rate has climbed above 13 percent. Even within the US, large differences have emerged: As of April 20, Michigan had reported a CFR of 7.6 percent, compared to Oregon’s 3.8 percent.

Since scientists are pretty sure the virus isn’t mutating very quickly, the pathogen itself shouldn’t be more deadly in one place than another. So why the variation?

Figuring out what is driving these disparate numbers reveals differences not just in population demographics but also in health care capacity and government response. Understanding CFRs might also help us slow deaths around the world — especially for the most vulnerable countries and individuals.

Why might fatality rates be so radically different?

Before diving into the details from different countries, it’s worth looking at some of the broad reasons why death rates can look so starkly different from place to place.

First, we know that there are big differences in the risk the virus poses to different age groups. For this coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, older individuals are far more likely to become critically ill or die from the disease. In a paper in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, researchers concluded, when looking at data from China and elsewhere, that people between the ages of 40 and 49 have an estimated CFR of about 0.4 percent; for those 80 and older, it’s 13.4 percent. This gulf of survivability is already playing out in some countries with older populations, such as Italy.

Additionally, Covid-19 has been demonstrably deadlier for those with existing health conditions, including lung disease (often caused by smoking), cardiovascular disease, severe obesity, diabetes, kidney failure, and liver disease. So countries — or regions — with less healthy populations might also be seeing big differences in the rates at which people are dying from the illness.

Beyond the varying impacts of the illness itself, there are lots of variables in how numbers are being gathered and reported. Perhaps the biggest factor here is testing. When experts calculate a basic fatality rate, it can be as simple as dividing the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases (although — and we’ll get to this later — it really shouldn’t be).

Since the international spread of the novel coronavirus, countries have varied widely in their ability and willingness to roll out testing. So that means the denominator (the number of cases) can be closer or further from an accurate count of how many people actually have the virus. The larger the percentage of a population that has been tested, the more complete picture we will get of the virus’s actual fatality rate there.

The other issue with the poor testing rates is sampling bias. Tests that are available are usually saved for the sickest and riskiest cases. This pushes the fatality rate higher than it actually is because the testing is more likely to omit mild or asymptomatic cases and instead overrepresents those who are more likely to die. So, as testing becomes more widespread in various countries, their fatality rates will drop.

That is no reason for optimism, as the authors of the study in The Lancet note. The researchers offer an overall CFR for Covid-19 at 1.38 percent, which reflects their estimates for lack of testing and other factors, including potential censorship. This number, they noted, is still “substantially higher than for recent influenza pandemics (e.g. H1N1 influenza in 2009)” — “swine flu” — which had a case fatality rate of 0.1 percent. Their estimated CFR, “combined with likely infection attack rates (around 50-80 percent), show[s] that even the most advanced health-care systems are likely to become overwhelmed.” It is clear that this is far worse than the seasonal flu.

Another way to look at death rates — in the absence of widespread testing — is to compare the number of Covid-19 deaths to a country’s total population, which is what researchers have done here.

In another effort to make up for incomplete testing (and possibly incomplete reporting), researchers are attempting to estimate what percentage of actual cases have been reported (as of a couple weeks ago) for each country.

The other factors likely impacting the vastly different fatality rates include a country’s resources (particularly its health care capacity), its organization (such as how easily it can institute effective, widespread public health measures), and how forthcoming it is with data.

We will likely see other factors emerge as the pandemic rages on and more data comes in. But here’s what we know so far about some of the key countries and their fatality rates for Covid-19 based on the number of confirmed cases.

For each country, we are using April 20 data from the University of Oxford’s Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, which has been updating its statistics on dozens of countries’ fatality rates daily. You can find their full list of countries, which includes data on how confident they are in their estimates, here.

China

Estimated CFR: 5.6 percent

Early on in any pandemic of a potentially fatal infectious disease, the death rate is going to be high for numerous reasons, including: health workers are not looking for the new disease and will miss cases early in their progression; there aren’t established treatment protocols for the illness; and people don’t yet know how it is spread (and, thus, how best to contain it).

In the first few dozen patients in China, all of whom were already hospitalized, the CFR was 15 percent, a paper in The Lancet noted. Although the rate has pushed down over subsequent weeks, as the origin of the outbreak, China’s relatively high overall rate is not a surprise.

Even though the first reported Covid-19 death occurred there January 11, experts still do not agree on what the country’s actual CFR should be. One group of researchers reported in Nature Medicine that, as of the start of March, the fatality figure there should be 1.4 percent of symptomatic cases. Another team, writing in The Lancet, estimated it should be 5.6 percent.

These sizable differences come from balancing considerations of estimating the capacity of health care systems to identify cases and deaths, determining the ability to approximate actual rates of infection (including those not tested), and accounting for the time delay between onset of illness and death (tabulating current deaths with current infections might be misleading because of the two- to eight-week lag from early symptoms to death), among other factors. Clearly, finding the CFR is not as easy as an exercise in long division.

China’s governmental response, facilitated by being relatively centralized, likely played a large role in eventually slowing the outbreak — and lowering the fatality rate — there. As more people were able to be tested and the hotspot of Wuhan was put on lockdown, fewer cases emerged, and those that did could be detected earlier. New evidence, though, also reveals that China has underreported the number of cases and deaths from Covid-19.

Italy

Estimated CFR: 13.22 percent

Italy currently has the highest fatality rate for Covid-19 of any country with a major outbreak. Why? One factor in this, experts have suggested, is the relatively older population of the country. The novel coronavirus is considerably more fatal with each passing decade of life. As a March 23 viewpoint in JAMA noted, those 60 and older in Italy have a 3.5 percent chance of dying if they get Covid-19; those 80 and up face a 20.2 percent chance.

And Italy has one of the oldest populations in the world. According to the World Bank, nearly a quarter of the country’s population is 65 or older, a higher percentage than any other country except for Japan. (There are also numerous other factors, including a cultural tradition of physical closeness, that could be contributing to Italy’s overwhelming number of cases and high death rate, as this piece from The Conversation points out.)

But that doesn’t entirely explain the country’s high number. (As we’ll see below, Germany, which also has a fairly old population, has a relatively low Covid-19 fatality rate.) Some of Italy’s dire death rate might be due to how slow it was to do widespread testing.

Italy has now performed a lot of tests — about 22 per 1,000 people as of April 20 (compared to about 11 per 1,000 in the US). But it was, compared to countries like Germany and South Korea, relatively slow in the early stages of its outbreak to make large numbers of tests available, allowing the virus to spread undetected for crucial periods of days and weeks while people went about their daily lives, unaware that a crisis was looming.

Germany

Estimated CFR: 3.19 percent

Experts are not sure why Germany has managed to maintain a relatively low fatality rate for Covid-19.

As HJ Mai reported in Vox, part of it does likely have to do with their aggressive early testing:

The [country’s Robert Koch Institute] early on recommended broad testing to detect cases as soon as possible and to slow the outbreak. “This is probably why we started to see cases very early, also mild ones, which in other circumstances might have been missed,” RKI’s [deputy spokeswoman Marieke] Degen said. “If you start seeing deaths, it indicates that the virus has already been active in the community for some time.”

Another benefit of the widespread early testing is that they were able to locate a larger number of cases — adding to the denominator — many of which were milder and less likely to lead to a death. As Mai wrote, “The majority of cases in Germany have been detected in people between the ages of 35 and 59. That most coronavirus cases in Germany are being detected in an age demographic that is not considered part of the high-risk population could be a further contributing factor” to the low fatality rate.

But there is another question of timing here, and that is when a country’s outbreak started. Germany’s outbreak began later than Italy’s, with Italy topping 1,000 cases by March 1, when Germany still was reporting just slightly over 100. And with the current estimates suggesting Covid-19 deaths occurring up to eight weeks after the onset of symptoms, as Mai notes, “That means there’s a chance Germany and other nations in a similar stage of the outbreak could soon see a spike in deaths.” Indeed, their fatality rate has been climbing slowly over the past weeks, rising from about 1 percent at the beginning of April.

South Korea

Estimated CFR: 2.21 percent

Widespread and early testing, however, is not all that it takes to keep infection and death rates low. The results of those tests also need to be swiftly acted upon to have the most benefit.

South Korea has been largely lauded for its rapid, robust, and coordinated response to its outbreak. In addition to having tested about 3 people per thousand by March 5 (which was days before the US even started testing anyone in the general population), they put the results of those tests to use right away, an article in Science explained. Positive cases were isolated. Additionally, that person’s contacts were traced, and they were themselves considered potential cases and asked to quarantine at home, as NPR reported.

New daily confirmed cases there spiked to their highest level March 1 — at 730 per day — and then dropped off, reaching an average of just 67 new cases per day by April 1. (By comparison, the US had 777 reported new cases per day on March 15 — and, as of April 15, had more than 26,500 new cases per day.)

To facilitate this massive undertaking, the country used GPS data from people’s phones (because your phone is better at remembering where you were and who you were near than you are). The approach raises privacy concerns, as Science pointed out, but it is also credited with helping to sharply curtail the country’s outbreak.

Japan

Estimated CFR: 2.19 percent

Japan, a country with more than 35.8 million people 65 or older, has many global health experts worried. The government has lagged on testing as well as on instituting strict social distancing guidelines. As of late March, many shopping malls in Tokyo were still open and busy. And as of April 15, the country had performed just about 1 test per thousand people (which pales in comparison to even the paltry efforts of the US’s 10 tests per thousand people by the same date).

As Eric Margolis reported for Vox, these facts do not bode well:

“Thus far, Japan has managed to escape exponential growth, but the worst may be yet to come. ‘This may be the tip of the iceberg,’ said John Ioannidis, professor of disease prevention at the Stanford School of Medicine. ‘If you don’t test, you find no cases and even no deaths.’”

What has people puzzled is the country’s relatively constant numbers of reported Covid-19-related deaths, despite rising case numbers. (There have been some questions as to whether Japan is thoroughly testing those with pneumonia, a common outcome and cause of death for severe Covid-19 cases.) Some attribute this to effective contact tracing that was done of cases early on in the outbreak or the country’s strong health care and elder care systems, Margolis noted.

Time — and increased testing — will tell whether Japan has efficiently controlled the virus and deaths as South Korea has managed to do. Or if it was a case of delayed detection and containment leading to a much larger disease burden.

United States

Estimated CFR: 5.31 percent

Where does the US stack up in all of this? Given that testing rates have been exceedingly low especially early on, as in Italy, undetected cases continued to spread the virus. As Dylan Scott and Rani Molla of Vox have written, case numbers in the US were more in line with Italy and Iran in mid-March, and “far outpaced places like Hong Kong and Singapore, where the governments mobilized more quickly.” The US is now on an even sharper trajectory of new cases than Italy or Iran. And that means a spike in deaths may well be coming next.

That is one of the other factors that can lead to a higher CFR: a sudden jump in the number of severe cases. When that happens, it “adds to the strain on the healthcare system and can overwhelm its medical resources,” wrote a team of researchers in The Lancet. That can result in not being able to save as many lives. (Hence the call to “flatten the curve.”) The US might be looking at this scenario in many places. New York City is already running out of hospital beds, with the projected peak outbreak there predicted to still be weeks away. And other cities and towns might face similar fates.

Risk map of #COVID19 in America? Here's mine: Any urban center with areas of high population density, esp those with #poverty/crowding where practicing social distancing can be challenging. So far it's been a good predictive map: NYC, Chicago, Detroit, NOLA, ATL, LA, SF, Seattle pic.twitter.com/WuQGMb7z1u — Prof Peter Hotez MD PhD (@PeterHotez) March 26, 2020

Within the US, too, the rates of mortality are varying widely. As of April 20, Michigan had a CFR of 7.6 percent — compared to Oregon’s 3.8 percent. The reasons for these emerging regional disparities are yet to be determined, but they will likely end up including the same factors that lead to countries’ different rates, such as the area’s healthcare resources and containment policies as well as the overall age and health of the population. (Current counts for states’ case and fatality numbers can be found here.)

What experts are looking out for next

It will be some time before testing catches up and we have firmer numbers for countries’ actual CFRs. Even when that happens, there will likely remain sharp contrasts among nations. As researchers noted in a March 20 Science report, “The patchwork reflects different phases of the epidemic, as well as differences in resources, cultures, governments and laws.”

As we learn more about the fatality rates for different populations of people, though, it will hopefully help governments make the best decisions about public health policies — as well as the best allocation of resources to protect and treat the most vulnerable.

A country’s response, so far, appears to have among the largest impact on the severity of an outbreak and the subsequent number of deaths, as demonstrated by South Korea’s apparent success (which was also achieved without broadly shuttering daily life). And as Vox’s Alex Ward writes: “Saving lives is ... about how quickly, thoroughly, and effectively the government responds to the brewing crisis. Any delay, it seems, is very costly.”

One of the big questions that remains to be answered is how the overlapping factors of a country’s age demographics and its health care resources impact the fatality rate. Going off of median age or the proportion of the population 65 or older may or may not end up being the next strongest predictor.

Countries with older populations tend, on the whole, to be wealthier and healthier, with better health and social infrastructures to begin with (for example, the notoriously rich country of Monaco boasts the highest media age: 55). Countries with younger populations, on the other hand, are often places where health care and other resources are scarcer and people are already not as likely to live to late adulthood (see Niger as the country with the youngest median age, at 14; and consider that in Uganda, only 2 percent of the population is over 65).

So, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues its global spread, experts will be closely watching not just countries with a large proportion of octogenarians but also those with higher poverty rates and already-stressed systems.

These countries might also be more likely to lag behind in test availability, logistics, and reporting, so it is possible that accurate data will be delayed or perhaps never be collected to know the true numbers of those infected or who perish from the illness. But even in the US, as the Atlantic reported, we might never know the true number of deaths this coronavirus causes. Because how we determine the ultimate cause of someone’s death is often not clear cut.

Will we ever know the pure case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2? Some scientists are looking to the natural experiment that took place aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined for more than a month. During that time, about 19 percent of the ship’s passengers and crew fell ill and were confirmed to have Covid-19. Of those 705 people with the virus, seven died, providing a CFR in a well-tested group of people of 0.99 percent. The cruise ship demographic did skew older, so, as researchers pointed out in The Lancet, “the CFR in a healthy, younger population could be lower.”

Whatever they end up being, the numbers from this pandemic will doubtlessly be studied for decades to come. As in a laboratory experiment where researchers set up different versions of the same test, changing this variable or that, the world’s countries are now part of this global test case.

With hindsight and thorough analysis, we will eventually be able to more carefully plot out steps and missteps and what combinations of factors from these experiments came to mean for different populations. And hopefully, with that knowledge, we will be able to better head off the next pandemic threat, which could be even more virulent.",vox,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/1/21203198/coronavirus-deaths-us-italy-china-south-korea
"['Ella Nilsen', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,How to apply for unemployment benefits if you’re a freelancer or self-employed,"Millions of workers who are self-employed, freelancers, or independent contractors qualify for a new unemployment program, set up under the recently passed CARES Act. But many are still waiting to apply for those benefits.

The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) expanded who is eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. Freelancers and independent contractors, previously excluded from these programs, now qualify through the end of July — and possibly beyond if Congress extends the program.

But it has been a challenge for states to get this money out the door. Unlike simply throwing more money at their existing unemployment insurance programs, many states have had to build new programs from scratch to help freelancers and independent contractors. Some of those programs are already accepting applications and preparing to send out checks while others are still being built.

Washington, Massachusetts, Georgia, and Alabama are among the states already accepting PUA applications, but many other states haven’t yet announced the dates for when they’ll have their program set up and ready for workers to file. Ohio, for instance, announced its program won’t be ready until mid-May, and many more states are telling workers to keep checking back for more information.

How to access Pandemic Unemployment Assistance self-employed, freelancers, or independent contractors

The best way to find out how to apply for your state’s PUA program — what the status of it is — is to visit your state’s unemployment website.

The application process for PUA programs is more complicated than for those who have been laid off or furloughed from an employer and who are eligible for regular unemployment insurance.

Keeping documentation about your previous income and wages as a freelancer, independent contractor, or self-employed worker is important and will help you when filing for unemployment. Keep documentation both about how you get your money and how much you have been paid per month in the past (old tax returns and invoices are good examples).

“Whatever documentation they have about how they get their money would be helpful,” said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. If people are lacking documentation, they can file good-faith attestations about their wages to unemployment offices, but documents are preferred.

Why has it been taking so long for states to distribute Pandemic Unemployment Assistance funds?

Each state is running on its own timeline rather than a set one by the federal government. Washington state set up its PUA program by April 18, but the numbers of people logging on to apply for benefits was so great the website crashed and phone lines jammed, according to the Seattle Times. Massachusetts recently announced it would start accepting applications on April 20 — about 10 days ahead of schedule. Officials in Pennsylvania said freelancers and gig workers could start applying by the end of the month. Other states, including Alabama and Georgia, say freelance workers can start applying through their unemployment websites.

Other states, including Ohio, are already looking at a May timeline before they can get their PUA programs ready to accept applications, and others haven’t released timelines. New York and Michigan, for instance, are asking people to submit PUA claims but are holding on to them until their programs are up and running.

Finally, states have to program the computers in their unemployment systems with the new information — and some states rely on mainframes and programming that haven’t been updated since the 1970s.

It’s a complicated process, made even more complicated given the sheer number of people trying to get benefits at the same time. States first have to wait for the Trump administration to issue guidance so they know they’re administering a benefit correctly. Then they have to set up their own policies and interpret them to decide who qualifies, said Evermore.

“These benefits are layered on top of a system that works well in some states and works terribly in others,” said Evermore. “When a recession rolls around, how are people surprised that it’s hard to get benefits?”

Are the benefits going to run out?

With 22 million people applying for unemployment benefits over the last month, there’s already consensus in Congress that another relief bill is needed, with more money for unemployment programs.

Some ideas congressional Democrats are discussing include either extending the extra $600 a week in federal aid or adding more weeks before an individual would be kicked off regular UI benefits (without the extra $600 per week), a senior Democratic aide recently told Vox.

“We want to make sure that we have covered unemployment insurance with sufficient resources,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told Vox on Tuesday. “At this point in time, I don’t have a number, but we want to make sure those who are unemployed have the ability to support themselves and their families.”

If you live in a state that’s slow to set up its PUA program, it’s important to know that doesn’t necessarily mean you will lose out on your full amount of benefits. Retroactive pay was written into the law, so people who have to wait longer to file will likely get a bigger check up front, according to Andy Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation.

“You could be looking at a $5,000 check all at once,” Stettner told Vox. But with rent and bills looming when May 1 rolls around next week, many people are wondering whether they can wait that long for their states to get things together.

“It’s going to be hard,” Stettner said.

"['Umair Irfan Brian Resnick Eliza Barclay', 'Umair Irfan', 'Brian Resnick', 'Eliza Barclay', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,7 things we’ve learned about Earth since the last Earth Day,"This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalism collaboration strengthening coverage of the climate story.

We celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22 in the midst of a pandemic, with the world slowed and hobbled by Covid-19. Yet Earth Day reminds us the planet still turns, the global climate and biodiversity crises still cry for attention, and nature still reveals its shimmering resilience. Google is honoring the occasion with a Google Doodle dedicated specifically to bees.

This Earth Day, as humans have retreated indoors to slow down the spread of the virus, we’re finding out how ecosystems respond to our absence from public spaces. Meanwhile, our planet, and our understanding of it, keeps changing at a frenetic pace. Average temperatures are rising, natural systems are degrading, and our vulnerability is increasing.

Even as many of us remain locked inside, there is still a big wide world out there with much to explore and discover. As part of a Vox tradition started by former Vox writers Brad Plumer and Joseph Stromberg in 2014, here are the seven most fascinating, impactful, and troubling things we’ve learned about our planet since the last Earth Day:

1) We live with a lot of air pollution, but we can reduce it pretty quickly

Sometimes you don’t notice something until it’s gone. Such is one stark visual lesson of the pandemic: Air pollution is something way too many people around the world breathe in every day.

The shutdowns of business and travel during the Covid-19 pandemic have cleared the air in cities as pollution has fallen sharply. China, for instance, experienced a 40 percent decline in nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant produced from burning fossil fuels in cars and power plants, earlier this year compared to the same period last year.

Air pollution is a deadly threat, killing millions around the world every year. It’s also linked to more severe outcomes for Covid-19. Conversely, the economic slowdown stemming from Covid-19 showed that reducing pollution yields massive benefits for public health. One researcher estimated that the drop in air pollution in China saved 20 times as many lives as were lost to the virus.

And China isn’t the only place seeing clearer skies. In the United Kingdom, nitrogen dioxide pollution fell 60 percent after the country implemented a lockdown compared to the year prior. A nationwide lockdown in India revealed skylines and mountain vistas that had been obscured for decades.

The Covid-19 pandemic has shown how quickly air quality can improve. But it doesn’t mean we should celebrate the pandemic for its impact on the environment. The clearer skies came at a devastating social and economic cost. The challenge for countries, then, is to reduce pollution without a massive toll.

Countries like China and the United States are weakening environmental regulations in the hope of helping industries better recover from the slowdown, so the pollution could come back with a vengeance. But it’s worth asking why we tolerated so much dirty air for the sake of the economy for so long and whether there’s a better way.

2) The virus that causes Covid-19 likely originated in bats. Many more potential pandemic viruses are out there, lurking.

Though we still don’t know exactly when or where the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, spilled over from wildlife to humans, scientists who’ve analyzed its genome say it appears to have originated in wild bats.

We shouldn’t be surprised humans got infected with a dangerous pathogen that was circulating in wildlife; with more and more people encroaching further into wild areas, the threat of an event like this has been clear. Scientists who study emerging infectious diseases have been warning about this scenario for years. The 2003 SARS outbreak (which also passed from animals to humans) ought to have been a wake-up call. Yet the big lesson from SARS-CoV-2, which has infected more than 2.5 million people and killed over 176,000 as of April 21, is that our efforts to stop these viruses before they start ripping through human populations have been woefully insufficient.

“Every emerging disease that we battle with preexists in wildlife,” says Dennis Carroll, the former director of USAID’s emerging threats division who helped design Predict, a surveillance program for dangerous animal viruses that the Trump administration decided to shut down in October. If we’re not looking for the viruses out in the wild, he adds, and if we keep putting pressure on the ecosystems, then we’re likely to get smacked with another crisis like this one.

Pandemics, says Carroll, do not have to happen. “They are a consequence of the way we live. You can pick [viruses] up earlier if you’re really including in your surveillance those places where animals and people are having high-risk interaction, those hot spots.” Most of those hot spots are in East and Southeast Asia, but the international community can step up collaboration to monitor them. As this Covid-19 crisis has proven, contagious viruses can spread quickly around the world with the help of us increasingly connected, mobile, and urban humans. Since they can quickly become every country’s problem, it’s in every country’s interest to stop them.

3) Life keeps disappearing at a stunning pace and scale

Since last Earth Day, we’ve seen even more evidence that the great diversity of life on Earth is shrinking. Every year, we say goodbye to a number of species forever, and this past year was no different.

Creatures like the Chinese paddlefish and the Cryptic Treehunter bird were declared extinct in the past year. Others like the Sumatran rhino are rapidly receding, now extinct in many of the places they once lived.

These extinctions were driven by habitat loss, overfishing, competition from invasive species, and climate change. But it’s a trend that’s been building for a long time, and over the past year, researchers revealed the astonishing pace at which these unique forms of life are disappearing.

We’re losing life at a larger scale than we realized. For instance, more than a quarter of all birds have vanished from the United States since 1970, a loss of nearly 3 billion animals. Over the past decade, 467 species were declared extinct.

And it’s not just the number of species lost that’s so alarming; the loss of biodiversity since humans started walking the Earth 200,000 years ago is vast. To replace just the mammal species that were lost in that time, researchers estimated last year it would take between 3 million and 7 million years of evolution to restore that kind of variety.

4) We keep discovering new species and learning new facts about old ones

Biodiversity might be contracting, but our understanding of it is not. Most species of plants and animals have yet to be discovered. And each year, we learn about more.

Since last Earth Day, scientists have discovered that there are three species of electric eel — for the past 250 years, researchers had thought there was only one. (The eels have been hard to study because, well, they are shockingly hard to handle. The Atlantic’s Ed Yong describes touching one as like being hit by a taser.)

A single scientific institution — the California Academy of Sciences — added 71 new plant and animal species discovered on five continents and three oceans to the record in the last year. Those included a purple iridescent fish named cirrhilabrus wakanda after the fictional kingdom of Wakanda (from the Marvel Black Panther comic and movie), 15 species of gecko, and six sea slugs.

Meanwhile, scientists learned that 10 apple varieties that were thought to be extinct were still around in rural fields and ravines in Idaho and Washington state, Smithsonian reported. And recently, for the first time ever, evolutionary scientists have documented how flowers try to save themselves after being knocked down. After an insult, the individual flowers on the stalk will rotate back, as best they can, into a position ideal for pollination.

These findings are reminders that there are many more discoveries waiting to be found. Even discoveries of life long since gone: This past year also saw a new study digging into the core of the crater of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Earth today is pleasant compared to the cataclysm of tsunamis, wildfires, and molten earth that followed that catastrophe.

5) In Australia, volatile weather and climate change converged to feed massive wildfires

The ferocious bushfires across Australia in late 2019 and early 2020 illustrated what happens to an already volatile climate as average temperatures rise and offered a window into the future for the rest of the planet.

The blazes ignited in 2019, already Australia’s hottest and driest year on record, and went on to burn more than 27 million acres, destroy more than 3,000 homes, kill at least 29 people, and send smoke around the world. The fires also killed more than a billion animals in some of the most unique and fragile ecosystems on the planet.

Volatile weather is a signature of Australia’s climate. The continent sits in the middle of three major ocean circulation systems, so it’s often vacillating between extremes. In 2019, those circulation patterns aligned in such a way to drive moisture away and trap heat.

But long-term changes are also underway. The fires emerged after years of drought, leaving vegetation primed to burn. And Australia’s climate has warmed by just over 1 degree Celsius since 1910, slightly faster than the global average. Rainfall patterns have shifted too, with more in the north and less in the southeast, where most Australians live.

So natural variability on top of climate change created the conditions for Australia’s devastating fires, with trends that were building for decades suddenly wreaking havoc over the course of weeks. Australia’s fire season is getting longer and more dangerous as well.

Though other countries may not regularly face Australia’s temperamental weather, they would do well to heed these risks as temperatures continue to rise. “Particularly in southern Australia, it sort of maps relatively similarly over other areas in the mid-latitudes, what we’d think of as the Mediterranean zone. So it’s the Mediterranean proper, like Spain and Italy and Greece, but [also] California, the tip of South Africa, [and] over in Chile and Argentina,” said Mark Howden, director of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University. “So all of those latitudes around the same as Australia, they’re getting drier, are getting hotter, having more problems in terms of water, in terms of agriculture.”

6) Satellites are beginning to obscure our view of the night sky

In the past year alone, the spaceflight company SpaceX has launched more than 360 small satellites into near-Earth orbit with the goal of using those spacecraft to build a worldwide internet access service. They’re just getting started. In all, the company has approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch 12,000 satellites, and Musk is seeking approval to launch 30,000 more.

The problem is that these satellites are bright, and they are already interfering with astronomers’ observations. Many scientists fear we’re beginning to lose a vital window into the heavens and a sense of our connection to the greater cosmos.

The problem is bigger than SpaceX; there are no international protections to ban bright objects in orbit. Even if an American company like SpaceX manages to darken its satellites (which the company says they are working on), another company in another country doesn’t have to. (And while SpaceX works on darkening its satellites, it keeps sending up the bright ones in regularly scheduled launches.)

Astronomers fear this is just the beginning. Soon, Earth may be blanketed by tens of thousands of satellites — many of which may be visible without a telescope — and they’ll greatly outnumber the approximately 9,000 stars that are visible to an unaided human eye. These satellites will bring telecommunications to some of the most remote parts of the world, but possibly at a great cost to science and our view of space.

7) Trees are superheroes, and the world is starting to recognize it

To help citizens cope with isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic, Iceland’s forestry service encouraged people to hug trees instead of other people.

But trees do more than keep us company; they are an important bulwark against climate change, cooling the air around them, capturing and storing carbon, supporting other species, and cycling moisture.

Protecting and restoring forests, then, is crucial for the planet. A research team last year found that helping forests recover and regenerate could soak up a large share of all the greenhouse gas emissions humanity has ever produced. Other researchers were skeptical of the scale of these calculations but otherwise agreed that nature-based solutions like protecting forests are critical to fighting climate change.

Yet the world also received a shocking glimpse in the past year of how vulnerable even the mightiest forests can be. The Amazon rainforest, the world’s largest tropical forest, suffered its highest rate of decline in more than a decade in 2019 driven by logging, mining, and agriculture.

There was also a huge increase in the number of fires in the Amazon. With so much rain, the Amazon rainforest does not experience wildfires, so researchers said the blazes were deliberately ignited to clear the forest, spurred by tacit approval from Brazil’s government. The fear now is that the forest is edging closer toward a self-destruct cycle known as a dieback.

The Amazon fires helped galvanize international attention toward protecting forests. And one thing that’s become clear since the last Earth Day is that people really like planting trees.

The United Nations’ Green Climate Fund raised almost $10 billion from donors last November to finance projects including forest restoration in developing countries. Philanthropists at the World Economic Forum announced their support for the Trillion Trees Initiative, aimed at planting scores of trees around the world. Even President Trump, who has been disdainful of acting to limit climate change, touted his support for the program during his State of the Union address this year.

"['German Lopez', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,Why some states became coronavirus hot spots — and others haven’t,"If you look at a map of coronavirus cases in the US, it can be hard to figure out any patterns. California reported some of the first coronavirus infections — including the country’s first instance of community transmission — but New York has reported 12 times as many deaths.

Michigan, meanwhile, has the third-highest number of coronavirus deaths in the US, but neighboring Ohio doesn’t even register in the top 10.

Florida was slow to shut down in response to the pandemic, but so far it’s reporting fewer deaths than nine other states, many of which were quicker to act.

Why? What explains why some states become hot spots for Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, but not others?

I turned to experts with these questions. While they cautioned that there’s a lot about the coronavirus and how pandemics work in modern society that we don’t know and are still learning about, they gave two major explanations for why some areas become hot spots and others don’t.

First, sometimes it just comes down to chance. Some places just happen to have populations, like the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions, that are more vulnerable to Covid-19. Factors beyond an area’s immediate control, such as its population density and perhaps even its weather, can also contribute to the virus’s spread. Whether any given place experiences a super-spreading event, in which one or more individuals transmit the coronavirus to a disproportionate number of people, can partly come down to chance, too.

Second, early action did appear to prevent coronavirus cases. Even in states that are not suffering a high number of Covid-19 deaths, chances are those figures would be even lower if they — or if the country as a whole — had acted sooner. There’s good evidence for this in some states, but there’s also research of past pandemics to back it up.

“A hot spot is a reflection of the combination of the random nature of things — in terms of who gets hit harder earlier — and then the timing of what we call non-pharmaceutical interventions” such as social distancing, William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, told me.

The key here is that states have direct control over one of these two factors. They can’t do much about luck. They have little ability to predict whether someone infected within their borders happens to spread the virus to a lot of people, and little control over their local weather or population density. But they can take swift, aggressive action to mitigate their chances of an outbreak — to limit the risk, for example, that someone becomes a super-spreader or that people are gathering in very dense crowds.

In other words, some of this comes down to uncontrollable chance. But to the extent that it doesn’t, different places need to be ready to take aggressive action and sustain it as long as necessary.

Chance plays a role in Covid-19 outbreaks

Some of the major contributors to a big, deadly outbreak are issues that are, at least for now, largely out of any given place’s control (even if past years of policy contributed to them). “There is a role for luck,” Hanage said.

For example, the age and general health of a population can contribute to just how bad a major outbreak gets, with older and less healthy populations more likely to become seriously ill and die from Covid-19. Italy has suffered one of the deadliest coronavirus outbreaks in the world — with a death rate of more than 10 percent among confirmed cases — and one potential explanation for that is it has the second-oldest population in the world.

Cities, states, and countries could perhaps have taken some steps prior to Covid-19 to shield their more vulnerable residents from infectious disease — by, for example, providing better health care or elderly care services. But once the coronavirus hit, places had to deal with the realities on the ground.

There are other factors outside of any particular place’s immediate control, too.

Timing is a big one. If a place is among the first hit by a new disease outbreak, it’s going to have fewer examples to learn from in figuring out what to do. States now look to New York as an example of things going very wrong, but that was possible only because New York got hit hard before most of them. Whether a place is among the first hit is largely up to chance or, at least, variables largely outside of any government’s control.

Places with higher population density are likely more vulnerable to the spread of the coronavirus. Places that rely on packed public transportation are likely more vulnerable, too. It’s possible that colder weather can make the virus easier to spread, as is true with some other viruses. (New York City, perhaps not coincidentally, checks all of these boxes as the densest city in the US, with the highest rates of public transportation ridership, and relatively cold weather.)

Whether a place gets hit by a super-spreading event can also come down to chance. There are things that governments and members of the public can do to mitigate the chance of such an event, like trying to keep people at home, restricting travel, and stopping large gatherings.

But there are some things that are harder to control. Perhaps someone spreads a virus widely before she’s symptomatic and before it’s known that the community is having a problem with that virus. Maybe some people are just more infectious for reasons we don’t yet know. Some communities can have infected people travel to them at the wrong time, widely spreading a disease.

It’s kind of like rolling a die. A die can be loaded in all sorts of ways, which vary from place to place and time to time, to prevent a bad roll that leads to a massive outbreak. But there’s always a chance that the roll goes very, very wrong — maybe the one person in an otherwise well-behaved town who disobeys a stay-at-home order turns out to be highly infectious despite showing no symptoms, launching a super-spreading event.

With the coronavirus, there’s also a lot we don’t know, from exactly how and where the virus most often spreads to just how deadly Covid-19 truly is. There could be variables affecting coronavirus outbreaks that we don’t even know exist. That makes outbreaks of the virus less predictable, leaving more of the situation to chance than would otherwise be true.

Early action and vigilance matter

While chance plays a role in any place becoming a hot spot, that doesn’t mean countries, states, and cities are powerless — far from it. Experts say that during a big outbreak, governments should do what can feel like an overreaction: The big goal is to prevent things from getting bad, so once policymakers are reacting to a bad outbreak, they’re already acting too slowly.

“Any time you are dealing with an outbreak, if it appears like you overreacted, then you probably did the right thing,” Krutika Kuppalli, a fellow in the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity program, told me.

To put it another way, states have to do as much as they can, even if it feels like too much, to load the die so that people aren’t spreading the disease to others.

Consider the stories of California and New York. Despite reporting some of the first Covid-19 cases in the US, California has avoided a massive outbreak. Again, some of that could come down to chance or uncontrollable variables, such as New York City’s higher population density and use of public transit, or California’s generally warmer weather.

“Any time you are dealing with an outbreak, if it appears like you overreacted, then you probably did the right thing”

But one likely contributor is that California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, reacted quicker to the outbreak. The Bay Area issued the first shelter-in-place order in the US on March 16, and California issued a statewide stay-at-home order three days later — while New York didn’t impose its own mandate until March 22. Even before these orders, some parts of California seemed to adopt social distancing early: OpenTable data suggests that seated dining on March 1 was down just 2 percent in New York City, but 18 percent in San Francisco. (It was down by only 3 percent in Los Angeles, though, so not every city in California acted the same.)

The extra days and weeks may not seem like that much time. But when coronavirus cases and deaths can double every few days, that short time span is important. “It’s exponential,” Hanage said. “And if you’re too late with it, you’re making the problem much, much, much worse.”

That’s especially true because the coronavirus can spread without any clear indication. The research increasingly shows that people can transmit the virus before they develop any symptoms, and regardless of whether they develop symptoms at all. Given the continued lack of testing in the US, that can mean the coronavirus is already spreading before people are aware it’s in the community — and it also might mean some places are underestimating just how bad their outbreaks are, potentially hiding hot spots before they become too bad to ignore.

“By the time that you start seeing cases show up in the hospital, there’s already a fair amount of transmission in the community,” Natalie Dean, a biostatistics professor at the University of Florida, told me. “If you wait until that happens and then you clamp down, at some level it’s already going to be out of control at that point.”

To that end, it’s important for states to act not only earlier on the calendar but also earlier in terms of their overall outbreak. For example, Ohio’s and Michigan’s stay-at-home orders took effect with only a two-minute difference, but Ohio’s order came when it was reporting around 100 new cases a day while Michigan’s came when it was reporting 500-plus cases a day. So Ohio’s order was likely more effective at preventing a bigger outbreak — and that could help explain why Ohio has one-fifth as many Covid-19 deaths as Michigan, despite having a slightly larger population.

One potential counterpoint to the need for early action is Florida. The governor there was slow to take action, not issuing a stay-at-home order until April 1. Yet the state has yet to see a huge outbreak, falling outside the top 20 for confirmed coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people.

Part of it may be that Florida got, in a sense, lucky. Maybe its relatively sprawling population, lack of widespread public transportation use, and warmer weather helped.

But there’s another explanation: Florida is much more than its state government, and other parts of the state took relatively early action. For example, some cities, such as Miami and Orlando, had stay-at-home orders in place in the weeks before the state took action. There’s also evidence that Floridians started to embrace social distancing before officials demanded it: OpenTable’s restaurant data shows that seated dining in the state started to fall in March and was collapsing, with drops of 20 percent or more, by the second week of the month.

There’s also evidence supporting the efficacy of early action from the 1918 flu pandemic, which was linked to as many as 100 million deaths globally and about 675,000 deaths in the US. A 2007 study in PNAS found that the places that took quicker action on social distancing — closing schools and banning big public gatherings — saw better outcomes:

[C]ities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates ≈50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but the difference was smaller (≈20%) and less statistically significant than that for peak death rates.

One example cited in the study is the difference between Philadelphia, which was slow to act, and St. Louis, which was faster. As this chart shows, St. Louis did a much better job of flattening the curve and averting excess deaths:

The goal with disease outbreaks is to look less like Philadelphia and more like St. Louis. And the key is early, aggressive action.

States can’t control luck, but they can be vigilant

Experts are clear that, even though some elements may be outside of any city, state, or country’s immediate control, no one should rely on luck to get them by this crisis.

Instead, experts cautioned that everyone should assume coronavirus will eventually come to them. The reality is that in a full-blown pandemic the risk is so widespread that it’s likely a matter of time, not chance, before an infection hits a place not taking the right precautions. “Even if you’re not rolling the dice now,” Hanage said, “you’re almost certainly going to be rolling them before this is over.”

In much of the US, that means painful social distancing measures for the time being — to flatten the curve and build up health care and testing capacity.

Experts especially emphasize the need for much, much more testing. While America has built greater testing capacity since March, progress appears to have stalled out in recent weeks at around 150,000 tests a day — far from the 500,000-plus or even millions of tests nationwide that some experts argue is necessary. Even that might overstate how well some states are doing; while New York has among the highest testing rates in the country at 32 per 1,000 people, Florida has less than half that at 12 per 1,000 and Texas has even less at 6 per 1,000.

Testing remains crucial to addressing the crisis. It gives officials the means to isolate sick people, track and quarantine the people whom those verified to be sick came into close contact with (a.k.a. “contact tracing”), and deploy community-wide efforts if a new cluster of cases is too large and uncontrolled otherwise. Without it, the only way to deal with the outbreak is more social distancing, which further hurts the economy, or letting the disease run its course — at the cost of potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of lives.

The recognized need for more testing is one of the major reasons much of the US is social distancing right now. “The whole point of this social distancing is to buy us time to build up capacity to do the types of public health interventions we know work,” Dean said. “If we’re not using this time to scale up testing to the level that we need it to be … we don’t have an exit strategy. And then when we lift things, we’re no better equipped than we were before.”

But the US just isn’t there yet, with continued shortages in the supplies necessary to run tests and tight restrictions on who can be tested.

“If we’re not using this time to scale up testing to the level that we need it to be … we don’t have an exit strategy”

To fix the gaps, experts argue, the federal government needs to relax criteria for testing, invest in new supplies and labs, and better coordinate supply chains to address, among other issues, chokepoints. States, with limited resources and little control of the national supply chain, simply can’t do this all on their own.

Such fixes, however, are easier said than done. Experts warn the next phase of testing will be much more difficult than the initial phase, which largely required getting existing labs to start doing coronavirus testing — the low-hanging fruit.

“We’ve made substantial progress ramping testing this month,” Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, wrote in a tweet on April 10. “But many gains were made by getting players into fight (clinical labs, academic labs). Now we must expand lab capacity, platforms, throughput, test kits. Getting next million tests/week will be harder than getting first.”

Until that work is done, states will need need to remain cautious. While some of the Covid-19 risk is due to uncontrollable factors, aggressive early actors like California, Germany, and South Korea show the risk can be mitigated. It’s important cities, states, and countries don’t leave this all to chance.

"['Alex Ward', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,Africa has so far been spared the worst of the coronavirus. That could soon change.,"Africa has so far been spared the worst of the coronavirus. That could soon change.

Share All sharing options for: Africa has so far been spared the worst of the coronavirus. That could soon change.

The African continent is extremely vulnerable to a large-scale coronavirus outbreak, but not just in the way you might think.

Nearly every country in Africa has recorded at least one case of Covid-19, leading over 30 nations on the continent to impose lockdowns to slow the spread. As of April 20, sub-Saharan Africa has more than 20,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 1,000 confirmed deaths.

The lower numbers than others could mean African nations acted early to stop a wider outbreak, but also that there have been very few tests on the continent and a young population might not suffer as visibly as places like Europe. In other words, there may be a larger outbreak that just hasn’t been officially identified yet.

Either way, experts warn those low numbers are unlikely to last. Millions in Africa buy the food they eat on the day they eat it. Storing large amounts of sustenance just isn’t a viable option, which means the daily trip to the market is vital for many. Governments asking people to socially distance, then, likely won’t work in the long run.

Related The devastating consequences of coronavirus lockdowns in poor countries

A massive coronavirus crisis would “become quickly an equal food security crisis,” Sean Granville-Ross, a Kenya-based economic and agricultural expert at the humanitarian organization Mercy Corps, told me. “We know millions of people in Africa live just on or just above the poverty line. With the slightest shock or crisis, it knocks them below the poverty line.”

That will only exacerbate the known challenges Africa has. Many countries’ health care systems are ill-equipped to treat patients without support from international organizations. Many governments don’t have enough resources to tell citizens what precautions they should take to stave off the virus, such as washing their hands for 20 seconds or keeping 6 feet apart. And millions on the continent, mainly in the east and south, already suffer from other complications such as HIV/AIDS that could make them more vulnerable to a Covid-19 infection.

These and other concerns led the World Health Organization (WHO) to estimate the continent could see 10 million cases of coronavirus within the next six months. And a report last week from Imperial College London predicted that some 300,000 people on the continent might die from the disease. A separate report from the UN Economic Commission for Africa said that in the worst-case scenario with no interventions against the disease, more than 1 billion — that’s with a “b” — might get infected and 3.3 million could die.

That’s a lot of bad news, but there are some reasons for optimism: Africa is an extremely young continent. More than 98 percent of the population is under the age of 65. That could make for a lower death toll than in places like Europe where the population skews older.

Many African nations also have experience dealing with major disease outbreaks, especially the 2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa. And international organizations are working to provide assistance and training.

Still, the continent’s larger problems like widespread poverty, poor governance, and major debt burdens mean the coronavirus crisis will likely deepen Africa’s woes for the foreseeable future.

“I’m worried for at least the next year,” said Michelle Gavin, the US ambassador to Botswana from 2011 to 2014.

Most African countries acted quickly to stop a larger spread

On February 3 — weeks before the novel coronavirus hit the continent — the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formed a task force to combat the virus. “This disease is a serious threat to the social dynamics, economic growth, and security of Africa,” Dr. John Nkengasong, the Africa CDC’s director, said at the time. “If we do not detect and contain disease outbreaks early, we cannot achieve our developmental goals.”

The organization’s main goal was to ramp up detection through testing and containment, especially at borders. Many African countries already had experience establishing similar checkpoints for diseases like Ebola.

Sub-Saharan Africa, then, had a head start in some ways before the continent’s first case was detected on February 27 in Nigeria. But there was a complication: The first case was an infected yet asymptomatic Italian man who’d traveled to the country and roamed freely for two days before his case was detected. Luckily, as the WHO African Region office’s technical director Dr. Mary Stephen told me, physicians in Nigeria were able to trace the man’s 121 contacts and found that only one person tested positive for Covid-19.

Other countries acted quickly once the first case in Nigeria was confirmed. Countries like Zimbabwe, Ghana, and Nigeria banned large public gatherings, closed schools, and imposed major lockdowns. In mid-March, some nations, like Sudan, also shut their borders to travelers from Europe, China, and the US to keep travelers from the world’s coronavirus hot spots away. In effect, it only took a couple of weeks — not months — to see a continent-wide response to the coronavirus.

That response wasn’t uniform across the continent, though, and in some places it was disastrous.

In Kenya, for example, the government initially imposed a curfew, not a lockdown, to stop the virus’s spread. Experts say the curfew, which the Washington Post reports “requires people to stay in their homes from dusk to dawn,” wasn’t enacted thoughtfully, as it was hard for many workers to return home before the curfew. Police also brutally cracked down on violators, even killing teenagers. In late March, the death toll from police shootings related to the curfew outnumbered coronavirus deaths in the country.

In Tanzania, populist President John Magufuli also tried to minimize the coronavirus threat. In early April, Magufuli continued to tell his citizens to attend religious services because, he said, the only thing that could defeat the disease was divine assistance. “Coronavirus cannot survive in the body of Jesus Christ, it will burn,” Magufuli said last month. “That is exactly why I did not panic while taking the Holy Communion.”

But overall, the coronavirus denialism expressed by leaders from Brazil to Mexico to the United States to China may be less of an issue among those in power on the African continent. “Once you’ve seen the footage from Italy and New York City, it’s harder to convince yourself that someone’s making all this up,” said Gavin, the former US ambassador to Botswana who’s now at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

For some experts, those numbers are low not only because the virus arrived on the continent late, but also because African nations acted quickly and effectively. Other experts, though, note testing and tracking isn’t widespread, meaning the real infection numbers are probably much higher.

Starting this week, the Africa CDC will dole out 1 million tests across the continent. That’s a start, but even Director Nkengasong noted that 15 million tests may be required over the next three months for the continent of over 1 billion people. Part of the reason for the massive testing gap is that richer countries have outbid poorer ones for critical supplies.

#COVID19 cases continue to increase in #Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa suffers the most severe outbreak, while Cameroon & Ghana have more than 1000 confirmed cases. Ghana, Niger, Cote d’Ivoire & Guinea have reported rapid increases in case numbers in the past week. pic.twitter.com/piBGs6W4wi — WHO African Region (@WHOAFRO) April 20, 2020

Still, Africa’s swift response may have just been enough to avert the worst. While results have differed around the world, countries that acted fast typically have fewer confirmed coronavirus cases, fewer deaths, or both.

What really worries experts, though, are the bigger structural issues impacting Africa — weak governments, food insecurity, and poor health care — that could endanger all the good work already done to stop the coronavirus from ravaging the continent.

“I don’t know what ‘flattening the curve’ really means in this part of the world”

During major public health crises, governments typically step in to help their citizens stay on their feet. That’s not a given in many African countries. Only a handful of governments in Africa, including South Africa and Rwanda, even have the resources to patrol the streets or disseminate accurate health information to the public, let alone to provide an emergency social safety net for vulnerable individuals impacted economically.

And even if a government wanted to commit more resources to fighting the coronavirus or bolstering their economies during the crisis, most owe large debts to the United States, China, or European countries.

It’s no surprise, then, that leaders in sub-Saharan Africa are pushing for large-scale debt relief as one of the best ways to combat the disease. The G-20 — a group of countries representing the world’s 20 wealthiest economies — have already “agreed to freeze bilateral government loan repayments for low-income countries until the end of the year,” the Financial Times reports.

But Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a special envoy from the African Union, isn’t satisfied. “My belief is that until the end of this year will not be adequate. We need a two-year time scale,” she told Politico last week. “I think that is what will give African countries the breathing room to be able to deal with the enormous consequences of the pandemic.”

China, one of the continent’s largest creditors, is balking at the idea of large-scale debt relief out of fear it might set a bad precedent of debt forgiveness. According to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese officials have asked officials from at least one country, Zambia, to provide collateral in exchange for help from Beijing — in this case, Zambian copper-mining assets.

Without large-scale and long-term debt relief, experts say, there is little chance most African governments will be able to effectively combat the disease or its economic impacts.

Other economic concerns, mainly the slowing of trade and loss of jobs, will surely make poverty and hunger in Africa more rampant.

Brian Bogart, who works at the UN World Food Program in South Africa, said that the world’s food distribution system will be impacted by the global economic slowdown. Food producers will struggle to gain access to credit and the supply chains required to grow crops and send them to market. Even simple items like chemical fertilizer to help plants grow in dry soil will be harder to come by.

At a more granular level, the loss of employment will make the need for food even more critical. That, in turn, will make social distancing measures harder to maintain. More than 1 million people are already out of work in Ethiopia, for example, and the continent’s GDP is expected to drop sharply this year.

Any day not making money, then, means fewer resources to buy food. That’s more devastating than it sounds, as Mercy Corps’s Granville-Ross told me the impoverished typically purchase food on the day they consume it. They don’t have the resources or ability to store large amounts of food for weeks on end. So while supermarkets remained stocked, items are often too pricey or too large for the poor to shop there regularly.

Many people in Africa spend the majority of their income on food. (For comparison, in 2018, Americans spent an average of 9.7 percent of disposable personal income on food, according to the US Department of Agriculture.)

This is a major concern. About a fifth of all people in Africa — about 250 million — didn’t have reliable access to food even before the coronavirus hit, while 25 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa are already undernourished.

And so chaotic scenes of people fighting for food, like the one in the Nairobi slum of Kibera last week, become more commonplace. Meanwhile, agricultural producers are contending not only with the challenges of the coronavirus but also with locust infestations that decimate crops and rangeland. (Experts say an expected second wave of locusts could be 20 times larger than the first two months ago.)

All of this means that for millions in Africa, staying home from work for a few days to avoid spreading or contracting the coronavirus just isn’t an option. “Poor people will prefer the lottery of infection over the certainty of starvation,” African health experts Alex de Waal and Paul Richards wrote for the BBC last week.

Water, too, costs money. Washing one’s hands for 20 seconds with soap, then, becomes harder to do when a family has to weigh nourishment against sanitation, says Granville-Ross. These stresses are particularly acute in countries like Niger or Angola.

“There’s just no way to socially distance,” the Council on Foreign Relations’s Gavin told me, leading her to believe “there can’t be just one public health playbook for this crisis.”

Finally, the continent’s ability to care for the sick isn’t well developed.

“Most of the countries have at least one treatment center, but they range from some with less than 10 beds to some of them with 100 beds,” Michel Yao, the emergency operations manager for Africa at the World Health Organization, told France’s RFI in March.

A March report from the WHO looked at how prepared countries in Africa would be to deal with a coronavirus outbreak. The chart below shows that while some African nations had “adequate” readiness status to deal with an influx of coronavirus cases, the majority at best were at the “moderate” status.

That same report also cited other problems, including that just over half of the countries surveyed had readily available personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers.

“I don’t know what ‘flattening the curve’ really means in this part of the world,” Bogart told me, “simply because there is not necessarily the same level of health care services or infrastructure to even overwhelm.”

But Stephen from the WHO’s Africa office and based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo expressed optimism that the provisions of health care will improve in the weeks ahead. Before the crisis, there were only two labs on the continent that could be used for coronavirus testing, she told me. Now, there are 44.

And the “integrated disease surveillance” system in place since 1988 — which allows local community members to let health authorities know if someone is sick — continues to work well.

After a community volunteer informs health officials, a team of epidemiologists goes to the house and asks if anyone feels ill. They’ll also go to nearby homes just in case “because some people are always hiding,” Stephen said. If the person’s symptoms match those expected from a coronavirus infection, then the physicians will ask for that person’s contacts even before the test results come back.

This is the same strategy African health care workers used during the Ebola outbreak, Stephen noted. The continent’s experience with that crisis has prepared physicians and others for what’s likely to come next. “Any experience with any outbreak is valuable experience for combating Covid-19,” she continued.

It also helps that less than 2 percent of Africa’s population is over the age of 65. Which means that a high coronavirus death rate among the most vulnerable population — older adults — may not be the biggest fear.

All that said, Stephen is still aware of the major challenge ahead. “There is really, really limited capacity in their infrastructure for the management of severe cases,” she told me, adding that the lack of ICU beds and ventilators poses the biggest problem.

The continent’s good work getting ahead of the crisis, then, may have saved many lives. But Africa’s bigger problems mean that many more remain at risk. The hope is that the worst scenarios for Africa — hundreds of thousands dead and maybe even a billion infected — don’t come to pass.

"['German Lopez', 'Apr']",2020-04-20,"4/20 in the age of coronavirus, explained","In normal times, April 20 would be 4/20, the unofficial holiday for celebrating marijuana. People would be preparing to rally near state capitols, in concerts, and at huge fairs to fill the air with thick, pungent smoke.

But April 20 this year, on Monday, doesn’t come during normal times. With a coronavirus pandemic still going, much of the United States and the rest of the world are staying at home as much as possible to avoid the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. That means the large crowds and rallies that have previously taken place in Denver, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and many other places around the world are not going to happen.

Yet 4/20 will go on. Before the big day, I got emails from marijuana companies asking, for example, if I was “throwing a virtual 4/20 smoke sesh.” (No, I’m not.) One such company advertised “awesome marijuana-inspired Zoom backgrounds so you can tune in and drop out, immersing yourself fully in the 4/20 experience” — in reference to the backgrounds that can be made for the video conferencing service, Zoom, used by workplaces globally and, apparently, marijuana users throwing virtual 4/20 parties.

My first reaction to all of this was, “What is this world?” But these ads also speak to the broader commercialization and mainstreaming of pot, and its growing acceptance in new realms of American life, as the drug is legalized in much of the country. That people are creating cannabis-related images for software largely linked to modern workplaces shows how far pot has come from the days when it was mostly associated with hippies and a broader counterculture movement that decried greed, corporate influences, and, really, all things mainstream.

As marijuana is legalized in more states and countries, that kind of shift will continue, with more businesses trying to take advantage of the commercialization of cannabis and reach a growing base of consumers in a newly legal market.

It’s a big change from what 4/20 originally was.

What is 4/20? And why is it on April 20?

4/20 is, in short, a holiday celebrating marijuana.

Why April 20? There are a few possible explanations for why marijuana enthusiasts’ day of celebration landed on this day, but the real origin remains a bit of a mystery.

Steven Hager, a former editor of the marijuana-focused news outlet High Times, told the New York Times that the holiday came out of a ritual started by a group of high school students in the 1970s. As Hager explained, a group of California teenagers ritualistically smoked marijuana every day at 4:20 pm. The ritual spread, and soon 420 became code for smoking marijuana. Eventually, 420 was converted into 4/20 for calendar purposes, and the day of celebration was born. (A group of Californians published documents giving this theory legitimacy, but it’s unclear if their claims are valid.)

One common belief is that 420 was the California police or penal code for marijuana, but there’s no evidence to support that claim.

Another theory is that there are 420 active chemicals in marijuana, hence an obvious connection between the drug and the number. But there are more than 500 active ingredients in marijuana, and only about 70 or so are cannabinoids unique to the plant, according to the Dutch Association for Legal Cannabis and Its Constituents as Medicine.

A lesser-known possibility comes from the 1939 short story “In the Walls of Eryx” by H.P. Lovecraft and Kenneth Sterling. The story describes “curious mirage-plants” that seemed fairly similar to marijuana and appeared to get the narrator high at, according to his watch, around 4:20. Since the story is from 1939, it’s perhaps the earliest written link between marijuana and 420.

Whatever its origins, 4/20 has become a massive holiday for cannabis aficionados.

Marijuana legalization is changing 4/20

What 4/20 stands for varies from person to person. Some people just want to get high and have fun. Others see the day as a moment to push for legalization, or celebrate legalization now that more states are adopting it and popular opinion is behind it.

In the 1970s, 4/20 was part of a smaller counterculture movement that embraced marijuana as a symbol to protest against broader systemic problems in the US, like overseas wars and the power of corporations in America. “Marijuana was the way you said you weren’t a suit,” Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, previously told me.

In recent years, marijuana legalization activists have tried to bring a more formal aspect to the celebration, framing it as a moment to push their political agenda. Organizers for the 2014 Denver rally — during the first year marijuana sales were legal in the state — put out a statement comparing the battle for legal marijuana to “the time when Jews fled from slavery in Egypt,” a moment commemorated in Passover celebrations. “This year’s rally represents the continuing fight for freedom from economic slavery for marginalized members of our community and a rebirth of creative genius that will get us there,” they wrote.

Businesses are also trying to take advantage of the holiday. Eddie Miller, the CEO of Invest in Cannabis, which seeks to bring investment into the marijuana industry, told me in the early years of state-level legalization that his company was trying to build and sponsor major 4/20 gatherings around the country — similar to what other companies, some of which Miller has been involved with, have done with holidays like St. Patrick’s Day.

“Our perspective is 4/20 is a real holiday — no smaller than St. Patrick’s Day or Halloween,” Miller previously told me. “It’s just nobody knows about it yet. And our company is going to let everyone know about it.”

Of course, these kinds of massive celebrations aren’t going to happen — or at least shouldn’t happen — in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic in which everyone is being told to stay home as much as possible to flatten the curve. But that they’d certainly happen if we weren’t in the middle of a pandemic speaks to how much 4/20 and broader attitudes toward marijuana have changed.

4/20 is becoming a commercial event

Originally, 4/20 was a counterculture holiday to protest, at least in part, the social and legal stigmas against marijuana. Marijuana legalization undercuts that purpose: As big businesses and corporations begin to grow, sell, and market pot, marijuana is losing its status as a counterculture symbol — and that, Humphreys speculated, could bring the end of the traditional, countercultural 4/20.

“If a corporate marijuana industry adopts 4/20, it would still be a celebrated event, but not with the same countercultural meaning,” Humphreys said. “People celebrated Christmas long before it became an occasion for an orgy of gift-buying and materialist consumption, but the meaning of the holiday for most people was different then than it is now.”

Companies such as Invest in Cannabis admit they’re already leveraging the holiday as another opportunity to promote the industry and its products — much like beer and other alcohol companies now do with St. Patrick’s Day.

“Our perspective is 4/20 is a real holiday — no smaller than St. Patrick ’ s Day or Halloween”

“The media is covering 4/20 as a consumer interest story,” Miller of Invest in Cannabis said. “But some portion of the media is covering 4/20 as a call to arms for the industry — so [in 2015] there are multiple competitive business conferences that are happening in Denver, the [San Francisco] Bay Area, and Las Vegas.”

The pot industry has also gotten directly involved in 4/20 events. The Cannabis Cup, for example, has become a major event at a selected city’s 4/20 rally, where hundreds of vendors show off their finest marijuana products to tens of thousands of attendees. The event has steadily grown over the years, featuring big concerts from notable musicians like Snoop Dogg, Soja, and 2 Chainz, as well as a wide collection of marijuana businesses as sponsors.

The Cannabis Cup has been only one of many events, which also include comedy shows (like Cheech and Chong), marijuana-friendly speed dating, and trade shows for glass pipes and bongs, offering businesses and celebrities various opportunities to push their products and brands.

Things have changed this year: Due to the coronavirus, the Cannabis Cup, scheduled to take place in Oklahoma, was delayed until May 11 to 15 — and that’s still subject to further delays, depending on how the pandemic rolls on.

Now, that may not mean much to the people who are celebrating 4/20 more traditionally. Some people don’t attend public festivities at all, choosing instead to stay home and enjoy a joint (or more) with their friends. For them, 4/20 remains a more casual affair void of big sponsorships and marketing.

But in public, 4/20 has increasingly become a commercial holiday — with the coronavirus outbreak putting a pause on things for now.

4/20’s shift shows how marijuana legalization will change cannabis

The shift in 4/20 from a counterculture holiday to a more corporate one shows how legalization is changing marijuana.

To many legalizers, this is a sign of their success. Legalization campaigns often adopt the tagline “regulate marijuana like alcohol.” That this is actually happening as the cannabis industry takes a form similar to the alcohol industry is a sign that legalizers are winning.

This has been true even in the middle of a pandemic. Some states, for example, have deemed liquor stores “essential” through their stay-at-home orders and allowed them to stay open during lockdowns. Some of these states have made a similar determination for marijuana stores, allowing them to stay open despite stay-at-home orders. It’s another clear way that marijuana is increasingly treated like alcohol and other legal drugs.

To some drug policy experts and legalizers, though, this is all a cause for alarm. The concern is that a big marijuana industry will, similar to the tobacco and alcohol industries, irresponsibly market its drug to kids or users who already consume the drug excessively — with little care for public health and safety over the desire for profits.

To this end, many drug policy experts see alcohol as a warning, not something to be admired and followed for other drugs. For decades, big alcohol has successfully lobbied lawmakers to block tax increases and regulations on alcohol, all while marketing its product as fun and sexy in television programs, such as the Super Bowl, that are viewed by millions of Americans, including children. Meanwhile, alcohol is linked to 88,000 deaths each year in the US.

“Marijuana was the way you said you weren ’ t a suit”

If marijuana companies are able to act like the tobacco and alcohol industries have in the past, there’s a good chance they’ll convince more Americans to try or even regularly use marijuana, and some of the heaviest users may use more of the drug. And as these companies increase their profits, they’ll be able to influence lawmakers in a way that could stifle regulations or other policies that curtail cannabis misuse. All of that will likely prove bad for public health.

The situation almost certainly will not be as bad as alcohol, since alcohol is simply more dangerous than marijuana. Pot’s risks, for one, tend to be nonfatal or at least much less fatal than alcohol: addiction and overuse, accidents, nondeadly overdoses that lead to mental anguish and anxiety, and, in rare cases, potentially psychotic episodes. Marijuana has never been definitively linked to any serious ailments — not deadly overdoses or lung disease. And it’s much less likely — around one-tenth as likely, based on data for fatal car crashes — to cause deadly accidents than alcohol.

Given this, the focus for drug policy experts tends to be the risk of addiction and overuse. As Jon Caulkins, a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University, has told me, “At some level, we know that spending more than half of your waking hours intoxicated for years and years on end is not increasing the likelihood that you’ll win a Pulitzer Prize or discover the cure for cancer.”

But these risks are still risks. Yet as the marijuana industry grows, it’s likely that the dangers will be issues the industry just doesn’t care much about — and it will market its products excessively for as much profit as possible, even if it means more public health or safety problems along the way.

The grim good news for those concerned with commercialization is that the coronavirus pandemic has forced a temporary halt on some of the commercial activity that could be expected around marijuana this 4/20. The bad news is it’s only a pause as the pandemic plays out — because, as the past few years of 4/20 celebrations show, cannabis really has evolved from a counterculture symbol to another commodity that companies can make a lot of money from.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Kim Jong Un is alive. And he’s ... at a fertilizer factory.,"Well, it looks like North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un isn’t dead after all.

In fact, he’s, uh, at a fertilizer factory.

For the last 21 days, the world has been wondering where Kim Jong Un is and if he’s even alive. Kim hadn’t been seen publicly since April 11. He missed a really important national holiday on April 15 honoring his grandfather, the country’s founder. State-run media didn’t publish any photos of a recent weapons test, which typically show the leader watching in approval. And official statements from the country have curiously lacked any direct comments from Kim himself.

All of that led to rampant media speculation that the 36-year-old Kim was recovering from major surgery, or gravely ill, or dead, and a flurry of activity by United States intelligence to figure out what, if anything, is really going on.

But it turns out he’s alive. On Friday, North Korean state radio reported the Dear Respected Supreme Leader had participated in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the opening of a new fertilizer plant. About two hours later, the first photos of Kim started to surface.

JUST IN: Photos of Kim Jong Un opening a fertilizer factory in Sunchon on May 1, according to KCNA. pic.twitter.com/jaLjjFk55K — Martyn Williams (@martyn_williams) May 1, 2020

So, mystery solved — well, sort of. We still have no idea where he’s been for the last 21 days.

And it’s entirely likely we won’t ever know the answer to that second mystery.

Kim has disappeared before — and we still don’t know why

As North Korea expert Rachel Minyoung Lee wrote for the New York Times on Friday, “This year alone, Mr. Kim disappeared for 21 days between Jan. 26 and Feb. 16, and for 19 days between March 22 and April 10.”

And in 2014, Kim wasn’t seen in public for five weeks, during which he missed a major holiday commemorating the founding of the ruling party. At the time, speculation about why he was absent ranged from him nursing a hangover, suffering from gout, or having been overthrown in a coup.

When he finally reemerged, there was no confirmed explanation of where he’d been. And, even more mysterious, he showed up walking with a cane — leading to speculation he’d been recovering from some sort of health issue.

Kim is believed to be in poor health: He’s a chain smoker, he’s obese, and he may suffer from gout. During this latest disappearance, there were unconfirmed reports that he’d undergone heart surgery and was recuperating — and perhaps that he was gravely ill due to complications from the surgery.

But it’s going to be near impossible to confirm that information, as Kim’s health is one of the most jealously guarded secrets in the country. Instead, Kim almost surely wants to change the subject, and showing up at a fertilizer plant as if nothing happened is one way to do just that.

So maybe Kim was sick, or maybe he was just enjoying a little vacation at his oceanside resort. Whatever the reason, he’s back now.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Russia’s coronavirus outbreak is getting bad. Putin says the worst is yet to come.,"Russia’s much-feared coronavirus crisis is here — and it doesn’t look like it’s slowing down anytime soon.

Russia was always going to struggle if a large outbreak occurred in the country, and experts predicted one almost certainly would due to the country’s proximity to China and tightly packed cities, including the capital, Moscow. Hospitals in urban areas lack reliable medical equipment and staff to operate them, to say nothing of the state of medical facilities in rural areas.

But few expected it to be this bad. As of April 28, Russia reported nearly 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 1,000 deaths. Those numbers make Russia the eighth-hardest-hit country in the world.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday admitted that the country had a shortage of critical personal protective equipment for health care workers, and warned that the worst the pandemic is yet to come.

“Ahead of us is a new stage, perhaps the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic,” he said in a national address, in which he also announced an extension of his nation’s lockdown until May 11. “The risks of getting infected are at the highest level, and the threat, the mortal danger of the virus persists.”

“Russia has managed to slow down the spread of the epidemic, but we haven’t passed the peak yet,” Putin continued.

His pessimism is warranted. Hospitals have become overrun with patients, leaving ambulances stuck idling in long lines outside hospitals just to deliver sick patients. At least one driver had to wait about 15 hours. Moscow might run out of intensive care unit beds before the end of this week. And nurses have quit en masse to protest poor working conditions and low pay.

Millions of Russians could lose their jobs this year due to the lockdown and oil revenues, which make up a significant portion of Russia’s economy, have dropped sharply as people around the world have stopped traveling and business have shuttered due to the coronavirus.

As if that weren’t bad enough, a top Russian nuclear official said Tuesday that the virus is threatening the safety of three “nuclear towns” — places where nuclear research is conducted in Russia, including the birthplace of the Soviet atomic bomb — by getting top scientists sick.

This is perhaps the biggest test has Putin faced during his 20 years in power. He markets himself as Russia’s hero, the only man who can restore the former Soviet Union’s greatness and bring stability to his country. Anything that messes with that image — such as a nationwide health crisis — ruins the myth he and his allies have cultivated for decades.

The problem for him, and the millions of Russians counting on his leadership, is that when it comes to fighting the coronavirus, macho posturing and disinformation just don’t cut it.

Russia’s health care system is quickly reaching capacity, if it hasn’t already

Earlier this month, Michael Favorov, who led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Eastern European and Central Asian programs, told me that Russia is “probably in the early stage of the same epidemic which is going on in the United States now.”

“They are facing significant increases of cases within the next month” in the capital and beyond, “and a significant increase in the number of deaths.”

Favorov’s prediction seems to have come true. Just look at the chart below, with coronavirus statistics from Our World in Data. After a late start, Russia’s daily confirmed cases (in purple) have steadily risen over the past month, more so than in previous European epicenters like Spain and Italy.

And those growing numbers are starting to overwhelm Russia’s health care system.

A viral video circulating throughout Russia, filmed by an ambulance driver who says he waited nine hours to drop off a patient, shows a long line of ambulances waiting silently to get into a hospital just outside Moscow.

В Химках образовалась пробка из машин скорой помощи с пациентами, у многих из которых подозревают коронавирус и пневмонию.



Скорые едут в 119 больницу, которая была перепрофилирована для приёма пациентов с COVID-19.#coronavirus #лучшедома #мы24дома #москва24 #м24 pic.twitter.com/XcOisjLDwf — Москва 24 (@infomoscow24) April 11, 2020

Yelena Alikhashkina, a patient who feared she had the coronavirus, told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty two weeks ago about her experience.

“I waited 3.5 hours for the ambulance,” she said, and it didn’t get much better after that. After she got in the ambulance, she said, it took 40 minutes before anybody answered the hotline to tell the ambulance where to take her. And when she finally arrived at the designated hospital, “there were 30 ambulances already in the line.”

Judy Twigg, an expert on Russia’s health care system at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me the long lines could be a function of Russia’s policy to have some hospitals treat only coronavirus patients while others handle only non-infected clients. While that may make treatment inside the coronavirus facility more efficient, it limits the amount of space available to those with the disease.

Dr. Vasiliy Vlassov, an epidemiologist at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, told me that the “government continues to open more and more hospitals for Covid-19 patients, and they are filled quickly.” Thus, it seems the amount of patients continues to reach the country’s health care capacity.

But the situation inside Russia’s coronavirus hospitals isn’t great, either.

Experts say a lot of the equipment Russian hospitals have, including ventilators, break down with alarming frequency. Russia is having more produced, but it’s unclear if those who need them will have them in time, especially as the rich hoard them.

Further, Russia generally is short of the equipment that goes with ventilators, like oxygen and anesthetic sedatives. And the country appears to be short of well-trained 24/7 intensive care nurses needed to care for patients on ventilators. Putin himself acknowledged on Tuesday that there is a shortage of protective equipment for health care workers.

Even if medical facilities had all the necessary equipment, it doesn’t appear they would have the requisite space for patients.

The hospital Alikhashkina visited, for example, stopped admitting new patients on April 13 due to overcrowding. That was bound to happen, as a 2017 study from the Moscow-based Center for Economic and Political Reforms found the number of hospitals halved in Russia between 2000 — Putin’s first year in power — and 2015.

If Russia continues to have around 6,000 confirmed coronavirus cases per day, as it has for about the last 10 days, Twigg said hospitals in Moscow and St. Petersburg “will get overwhelmed soon, as it looks like they’re already at capacity.”

Physicians like Irina Sheikina, from the capital’s Hospital No. 15, agree. “There are already nearly 1,500 patients, all with pneumonia,” she told the same outlet. “There are not enough beds. They put patients wherever there is free space.”

The lack of beds is a widespread problem.

Earlier this month, experts told me the entire country had about 70,000 hospital beds. That amount clearly wasn’t enough to handle the quick spike in Russia’s coronavirus cases. Now, hospitals in Moscow and elsewhere in the country are seeking extra beds wherever they can. As they struggle to do so, the hope is a makeshift hospital currently under construction outside Moscow might help with the overflow by taking about 500 more patients.

But in one area at least, conditions are so bad that some professionals have decided it’s no longer worth serving in Russia’s health care system.

Over a dozen members of the nursing staff from Kommunarka hospital, the top coronavirus facility in Moscow, abruptly quit together on Monday because they didn’t have enough protective gear, food to eat, or some of the $132 million in bonuses Putin promised the nation’s physicians.

A video from the Moscow Times shows one of the nurses explaining why she left the hospital. “I worked for two days straight, sometimes three,” the unnamed medical professional said. “They stopped feeding us. They started handing out unsanitary [used] equipment to us.”

“No one paid us for extra shifts,” she continued. “I want people to listen to us finally, and I want us to be paid the money Vladimir Putin has promised us, especially for those working in these conditions.”

From almost every angle, then, Russia’s coronavirus crisis has hit — and hit hard.

“We in Russia are still in doubt about what is going on in the country”

No one can accuse Putin of standing by as the coronavirus swept across the globe.

On January 30, the Kremlin closed its large, far-eastern border with China and suspended the issue of electronic visas to Chinese people. Days later, it evacuated Russians in China on military airplanes and threatened to deport foreigners who tested positive for the disease.

That same month, passengers flying into Moscow from China, Iran, and South Korea — the coronavirus epicenters at the time — had to undergo tests once they stepped off the plane. Meanwhile, citizens returning from Europe would have their temperatures checked and be ordered to quarantine for 14 days at home.

Experts told me those measures, while tough, at best limited the number of infected people in the country and perhaps prevented an even larger outbreak than the one Russia is currently experiencing.

But it’s clear that Putin and his team have gotten more serious as the coronavirus crisis got more serious, too.

In an April 1 videoconference, Putin told government members to tell him truthful information when he needs it. “The results of our work should correspond to what is happening at present,” he said. That, for VCU’s Twigg, was surprising. “It was an implicit admission that what’s been going on until now was everybody lying to each other,” she told me.

Now Putin is extending lockdowns, telling citizens that the worst is yet to come, and having new hospitals built. There’s no question that he’s taking the crisis seriously, but the state of Russia’s health care system looks like it isn’t ready for the moment.

That goes against the kind of bravado Putin’s regime showed earlier in the year. Russian propaganda claimed earlier this month that the country was better prepared than the United States for what was coming, even noting how Putin had offered President Donald Trump assistance. In fact, a Russian plane with medical equipment was dispatched to the US.

Some experts still suspect that the country’s official coronavirus statistics aren’t fully transparent, perhaps in an effort to make the situation look better than it is. Pro-Kremlin accounts on social media usually still focus on the low number of deaths, for example, as a way to say Putin has everything under control.

“We in Russia are still in doubt about what is going on in the country,” Vlassov, the epidemiologist, told me. “It’s not only doubt in the state’s statistics, but also in the picture in the social media.”

“The number of lethal cases ascribed to Covid-19 are still low,” he continued. “I think that it is a result of the misclassification of deaths from [the disease] to the other conditions or complications.”

That’s happened before: In 2015, Putin said he wanted to lower the death rate caused by cardiovascular disease in Russia. Almost immediately, hospitals began to report that fewer people were dying from heart conditions. What made that more suspicious is that there was a rise — at about the same rate — of deaths from other causes.

No one in the world, except for maybe Putin, has the full picture of what the crisis really looks like in Russia. But based on what’s already known, Putin has a lot more work to do.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,Has Sweden found the best response to the coronavirus? Its death rate suggests it hasn’t.,"You’d be forgiven for thinking Sweden had somehow found the secret to handling the coronavirus crisis without having to impose severe lockdowns.

Its total number of deaths, roughly 2,300 as of April 28, seems low, and it doesn’t look anywhere near as chaotic as, say, New York City. It’s no surprise, then, that the New York Times in a Tuesday story made the case that “to a large extent, Sweden does seem to have been as successful in controlling the virus as most other nations.”

“Sweden’s experience would seem to argue for less caution, not more,” the story also said.

But that sentiment obfuscates some very real problems with Sweden’s approach — problems that become much clearer once you zoom out.

The chart below, which I made using the Our World in Data website’s coronavirus statistics, helps put Sweden’s situation in perspective. It compares countries’ rates of coronavirus deaths per 1 million people.

As the chart shows, Sweden is actually faring worse than other Scandinavian nations and even worse than the United States, which has the highest number of confirmed total cases in the world. (It’s important to note that other nations — such as Spain and Italy — not included in the chart have higher death rates per million people than Sweden.)

The reason for Sweden’s high death rate has to do with the government’s policies.

Following the advice of the country’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, the Swedish government chose not to impose strict lockdowns, curfews, or major border closings because the government felt it would hurt the economy and would only push the crisis further down the road.

“Locking people up at home won’t work in the longer term. Sooner or later, people are going to go out anyway,” Tegnell told reporters this month.

And while experts say the vast majority of Swedes followed the government’s social distancing guidelines and voluntarily stayed home, those who continued to drink at bars and shop at stores likely spread the disease around.

The New York Times even noted what Sweden’s public health officials now admit: That “more than 26 percent of the 2 million inhabitants of Stockholm will have been infected by May 1.”

That’s still higher than New York City’s infection rate, which New York state officials estimate could be around 21.2 percent based on recent antibody testing (though these numbers are still preliminary and based on just one study).

Where Sweden does compare favorably to the US is the country’s death rate when compared to New York City’s (not the whole US). About 12,000 reported deaths as of April 28 in a city of 8 million is surely worse than 2,300 deaths in a country of 10 million.

But there are three main reasons why the Big Apple would be worse off than the entire country of Sweden, experts say.

The first is population density: New York City has more than 38,000 people per square kilometer, while Sweden has just 25 people — meaning it’s harder to socially distance in New York.

Second, some hospitals in New York City were overwhelmed while Sweden still has about 250 hospital beds unoccupied. There are indications, though, that the hospital surge in New York City is declining.

Finally, there is significantly more international travel to New York City than there is to Sweden, which means there were more opportunities for people from countries suffering from severe outbreaks to spread the virus to the city than to the European country.

But when zooming out, it’s clear that Sweden as a whole is worse off than the US as a whole. That could, of course, change down the line, but any current arguments that Sweden got its outbreak response right are premature at best and dangerous at worst.

"['Matthew Yglesias', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,The successful Asian coronavirus-fighting strategy America refuses to embrace,"East Asian countries were way ahead of much of the West in adopting widespread mask-wearing as a means to reduce transmission of the coronavirus. And complaints about the Trump administration’s inability to ramp up testing to the kind of levels successfully used to curb a once-major outbreak in South Korea have been endemic for months.

But there’s something else Asian countries do to control the spread that seems almost unthinkable in the United States: centralized isolation of people who test positive for Covid-19 and their close contacts.

The implementation of these systems varies from country to country, according to local circumstances and preferences. But from China to Hong Kong to Taiwan to Korea, the broad outline is the same: You don’t tell sick people to go home where they can infect their families and roommates; you send them someplace set aside for the purpose. Since some of the people isolated end up being asymptomatic, it’s inconvenient to be forced outside of the home. But for the many people who do get sick, just not sick enough to require intensive care in a hospital setting, it’s convenient to have a safe and well-monitored place to recuperate.

Isolation is the less warm-and-fuzzy side of the “more testing and more contact tracing” mantra. But it does seem to work. Singapore, for example, had coronavirus well contained but didn’t practice centralized quarantining among its population of migrant workers — only to see their dorms become a major outbreak hot spot.

Many Americans instinctively resist this idea, or assert that other Americans would. But the fact is the US has already accepted drastic restrictions on activity to curb the pandemic, and centralized isolation measures might make it easier to shift to more freedom on other fronts. Meanwhile, the country is currently well-provisioned with vacant hotel rooms and college dorms that could be used for the purpose. And even if mandatory isolation turns out to be a bridge too far politically, a purely voluntary quarantine system could still do an incredible amount of good.

America’s current policy: Test and go home

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other American public health institutions, the best thing to do if you get sick with Covid-19 and don’t require hospitalization is to try to isolate yourself at home to protect your family members or roommates.

“As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home,” says the CDC. “Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available.”

For many people, this simply isn’t possible in practice. The New York Times reporter Dana Goldstein described her experience of getting sick only to see her husband and young daughter also succumb to infection since there was no practical way to isolate inside their New York City apartment.

11. We lacked masks, surgical gloves and a second bathroom. My husband was taking on all childcare and could not also disinfect every item I touched. In a functioning system, medical supplies would be provided to affected families, or sick patients would be cared for elsewhere. — Dana Goldstein (@DanaGoldstein) March 31, 2020

At the opposite end of the spectrum, my family owns a rowhouse in Washington, DC, that includes a basement apartment with a kitchen, washer-dryer, and separate entrance. We normally rent it out on Airbnb or use it as guest lodging when family or friends from out of town want to visit. None of that is possible during the pandemic, so right now it’s my home office. But I’ve also set it up as quarantine quarters, stocked with easily 14 days’ worth of nonperishable food and everything else I’d need in the event that I start showing symptoms.

But while this is nice for me, it’s an unrealistic at-home standard for the typical person, and it’s not even clear that isolating in the basement would work. Chris Cuomo ended up living out my hypothetical basement isolation plan when he was diagnosed with Covid-19, but his wife got sick anyway.

It’s not 100 percent clear how that happened, though after reading a preliminary study about how there’s some evidence the coronavirus could spread via air conditioning ducts, it’s possible centralized climate control systems could negate efforts to isolate at home.

Standard practice in developed Asian countries, by contrast, is to isolate the moderately — or often even just potentially — ill outside the home.

Asia’s policy: Isolate in a dedicated facility

Hong Kong has more metro riders than New York in a city with a similar population size and significantly fewer miles of track. And while Hong Kong has a lower overall population density than New York City, that’s because nearly 40 percent of the territory is composed of designated country parks that are free of development. The built-up portion of Hong Kong is hyper-dense, and the average apartment is smaller than 500 square feet.

But despite these factors and very close economic linkages to China, Hong Kong contained the crisis — not just with tests but with centralized isolation.

Mike Bird, a Wall Street Journal financial markets correspondent based in Hong Kong, describes a very different situation from what Goldstein faced. Simply because a friend fell sick, Bird was placed in a spartan but comfortable isolation camp for a 14-day spell.

What real contact tracing looks like : A friend caught covid-19, so I was put in a HK quarantine camp for close contacts 'til it'd been 14 days since I'd seen them. Been out a little while now, never had symptoms of any sort. More natural light, faster wifi than my flat. pic.twitter.com/xAJwEH6MUe — Mike Brrrrrd (@Birdyword) April 5, 2020

Korea, which simply had too many cases to isolate this aggressively, needed to adopt a tiered system. Moderately ill people are sent to an isolation center, and only genuinely asymptomatic cases are told to stay home and self-quarantine there. But people ordered to stay home aren’t left on their own. The government sends “quarantine care packages” with groceries, masks, hand sanitizer, and instructions on how to safely dispose of potentially contaminated trash. The Koreans have also been experimenting with location-tracking bracelets to enforce self-quarantine orders.

At the other end of the spectrum, case volumes in Taiwan have been persistently low enough that hospitals are the centralized isolation facilities.

In mainland China, where the outbreak raged out of control after weeks of denial and cover-up from authorities, a wide suite of tough measures was eventually brought to bear to get things under control. A large team of researchers led by the University of Southampton looked at Chinese data and determined that of everything they did, “early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions.”

This is what Americans are talking about when they emphasize the centrality of more testing to getting the country safely moving again. But the “isolation” part of the strategy is important. If you test people and keep them trapped inside with their families, you’re not accomplishing nearly as much as you would if you actually isolated them.

Are we sure this wouldn’t work in America?

A common reaction in the United States is that while this might work fine in Asian countries, there’s no way it would fly in America. As Ezra Klein writes, “the US is a very different country, with a more mistrustful, individualistic culture.”

That might be so. But it’s worth recalling that in 2017, hundreds of thousands of Koreans took to the streets in a sustained mass protest movement to get a corrupt president booted from office. The incredible protest movement that rocked Hong Kong throughout 2019 was less successful, but the courage and tenacity of those protesters showed pretty clearly that Asian authorities are not dealing with a sheep-like public or one that puts unquestioning trust in incumbent governments.

Mass publics have been willing to embrace quarantine measures in part because they make sense. The US government’s official stance is that it’s not safe for a sick person to have contact with her roommates, family, or even house pets; given that reality, it’s the failure to isolate that seems to require justification. It’s also more humane. Nobody wants to listen to a loved one suffer alone in the room next door without comfort or assistance. Even people who don’t require acute care benefit from some kind of attention and support, and that’s best provided by trained personnel in an organized setting.

Last but by no means least, stricter restrictions on the activities of those exposed allows for a less restrictive overall environment.

America’s current policy restricts healthy people’s ability to access outdoor space, generates paranoia about passing encounters with runners or cyclists, and discourages people from seeking routine health care for ailments that aren't Covid-19. But actual sick people are sent home to potentially infect their loved ones. It’s not so much that the US is doing more than Asia to prioritize liberty over public health as that it’s ignoring evidence on which restrictions of liberty are effective.

Even if mandatory centralized quarantine does prove to be a bridge too far for the American political system, the striking thing about the status quo is there’s no good way for people to voluntarily isolate themselves from other members of the household.

If states and cities began to invest in quarantine facilities — like by buying out hotels, which are currently hurting for lack of customers — opening them up on a voluntary basis could do an enormous amount of good. But especially for jurisdictions with smaller caseloads that are eager to “open up,” it’s really worth thinking harder about what the plan is when new cases pop up.

Strict centralized isolation measures would likely ultimately be cheaper and less invasive than ping-ponging in and out of lockdown. It’s what the most successful coronavirus-fighting countries are doing. And since the US has already turned almost every aspect of daily life upside down, it should think about trying a similar strategy, too.

"['Zeeshan Aleem', 'Alex Ward', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-26,Italy will take small steps to restart its economy as early as this week,"Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced plans on Sunday, April 26, that sketch out how the government will incrementally relax coronavirus-related social distancing restrictions in the coming months, some of which will be lifted as early as this week.

Conte’s plans highlight how Italy — where the coronavirus has been more lethal than anywhere else in Europe — is seeking to strike a balance between reviving its nearly lifeless economy and unleashing a new wave of cases that will cause another lockdown.

In an interview with the newspaper La Repubblica, Conte explained that some businesses considered “strategic” — primarily involved in exports — could be opened as early as this week. He pointed out that letting these sectors restart was urgent because they could be cut out of production chains, according to Reuters.

“We can’t prolong any further this lockdown ... we would risk seriously undermining the socioeconomic fabric of the country,” Conte said.

According to Reuters’s analysis of local reporting and Conte’s interview, the tentative plan for what he has called “phase 2” of the coronavirus response looks like this:

Construction, manufacturing, and wholesale businesses open on May 4

Retailers open on May 11

Bars and restaurants open on May 18

Schools will remain closed until September

As these policies roll out, businesses are expected to observe safety measures to minimize risk of transmission. Conte is expected to release a formal roadmap laying out the details early next week.

His interview comes days after a Facebook post in which he called for “serious scientific policy” that helps gradually revive the economy.

“I would like to be able to say, let’s open everything. Right away,” he wrote on Facebook. “But such a decision would be irresponsible. It would make the contagion curve rise uncontrollably, and would jeopardize all the efforts that we’ve made until now.”

Italy has been in strict lockdown since March 9. It was in many ways the canary in the coal mine for the West: the first example outside Asia of the havoc the coronavirus could wreak on an unprepared country.

A new study suggests Italy’s outbreak likely began in January, but the country diagnosed its first local patient on February 21 — after which, cases and deaths quickly skyrocketed. More than 25,000 people have died in the country, giving it one of the highest per capita fatality rates in the world.

Italy’s Civil Protection Agency reported that the rate of new infections has slowed since early March; last week, it said there was a decrease in the number of active coronavirus cases in Italy for the first time since February.

The day after Italy crossed that milestone — in which the number of cases dropped by 20 from the day before — the Italian special commissioner for the coronavirus emergency, Domenico Arcuri, said, “This gives us the strength to go forward.”

Italian business leaders have been advocating for restarting the economy as quickly as possible. but so far the government has emphasized that reopening must be extremely careful in order to avoid a relapse.

In his Facebook post, Conte said that “maximum caution” must remain as a guiding principle, and that “the easing of measures must take place on the basis of a well-structured and articulated plan.”

Conte’s coronavirus advisers have also emphasized to the public that things won’t simply be returning to normal anytime soon.

“It’s not by chance that you use the same word, ‘depression,’ both economically and existentially,” Fabrizio Starace, a psychiatrist on Italy’s coronavirus task force, recently told the Washington Post. “The fantasy everyone is entertaining is that of a return to normalcy. Clearly our gradual recovery won’t match normalcy.”

“We need to rethink development, production, the speed of our lives, our lifestyles,” Filomena Maggino, another member of the task force, told the Post.

Some politicians in Italy have called for using antibody testing to see who has recovered from Covid-19 in order to get them to repopulate the workforce and to give them special licenses. Still, as of now, the WHO has recommended against such policies given concerns over the possibility of reinfection and uncertainty over the biological markers that indicate immunity.

Italy is also rolling out a non-mandatory contact tracing app that will alert people if they’ve been near someone with a confirmed case of the virus, but the Washington Post reports that experts are skeptical Italy has the labor force required to make the app effective for executing targeted quarantines.

Nonetheless, Italy, poised for the worst recession it has seen since World War II, is moving ahead as quickly and as carefully as possible.

"['Zeeshan Aleem', 'Alex Ward', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-25,China reportedly lobbied the EU to dial down criticism of its Covid-19 disinformation campaigns,"Evidence-based explanations of the coronavirus crisis, from how it started to how it might end to how to protect yourself and others.

China has reportedly successfully lobbied European Union officials to rewrite and soften language in a new report criticizing Beijing for spreading disinformation around coronavirus.

According to reports in the New York Times and Politico, Chinese diplomats managed to persuade EU officials to scrap a reference to China running a “global disinformation” campaign, and also remove reference to Beijing’s criticism of the French response to the pandemic.

The final version of the report reads mildly: “Official and state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and — to a lesser extent — China, have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation.”

The lobbying campaign represents the latest instance of the Chinese government attempting to control narratives in order to defend its reputation, after failing to keep coronavirus within its borders and to properly alert other countries of the threat the new virus poses.

Recently, Chinese officials and news outlets have deliberately spread false information — most notably the conspiracy theory that the US Army introduced the novel coronavirus to Wuhan and started the pandemic itself.

Despite this, Chinese officials have reportedly been keen on shielding themselves from criticism over spreading disinformation. Officials from the country even threatened to retaliate in some form against the EU if the bloc’s report language wasn’t softened, according to the New York Times.

“The Chinese are already threatening with reactions if the report comes out,” Lutz Güllner, an EU diplomat, wrote to colleagues in an email, the Times reported.

It’s unclear what those “reactions” would have been, and whether they would come in the form of diplomatic posturing or a policy move. But the Times noted that the EU is currently expecting to win trade concessions from China, an expectation that may have informed decision making around the report.

The report was eventually put out by the European External Action Service’s Strategic Communications division, which analyzes disinformation campaigns that affect the EU. A spokesman for the group denied the reports and claimed that they have “never bowed to any alleged external political pressure,” according to Politico.

China is desperate to control the narrative

Beijing has gone to great lengths to use information both defensively and offensively to protect its international reputation as a virus that originated within its borders has gone global.

As Vox’s Julia Belluz explained in February, Beijing downplayed or covered up many of the key facts of the early spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a bid to project an image of competence and control:

On December 31, when China first announced the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonia, officials there emphasized a few things. Most of the patients had been to a food market in Wuhan, the city that’s still the epicenter of the outbreak. They said there was “no clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission, meaning the virus wasn’t yet spreading from one person to another but instead, they suggested, from an animal to humans. And they said the earliest case had shown symptoms only recently — on December 12. Yet, for weeks now, reports in both the scientific literature and local and international news have contradicted what Chinese authorities were telling the world. These reports show the outbreak started weeks or months sooner than China let on, and the virus was already spreading among people — and beyond the food market in Wuhan — in early January. Authorities also censored information and silenced the whistleblowers who tried to sound the alarm.

More recently, China has pushed conspiracy theories that the US spread the virus in China as a way of shifting any blame for the pandemic away from the Chinese government.

“There are a few Chinese officials who appear to have gone to the Donald J. Trump School of Diplomacy,” Julian Gewirtz, a scholar at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard, told the New York Times in March, in response to reports of conspiracy theories. “This small cadre of high-volume Chinese officials don’t seem to realize that peddling conspiracy theories is totally self-defeating for China, at a moment when it wants to be seen as a positive contributor around the world.”

China, of course, is not alone in pursuing this strategy. The US has also worked to exaggerate and spread inaccurate information about China’s handling of the coronavirus. Trump, for example, has spread the rumor that the virus originated in a Chinese lab, despite an absence of proof that this happened — and overwhelming skepticism from scientists that the virus originated in one.

"['Zeeshan Aleem', 'Alex Ward', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-25,India takes a small step toward relaxing its strict lockdown,"India’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown — the world’s largest, and one of its strictest — was eased slightly on Saturday when small neighborhood convenience stores were allowed to reopen.

The incremental step represents the government’s desire to slowly reopen some business sectors and provide relief for small, cash-strapped businesses as the economy reels from stay-at-home orders that have been in place since March.

India’s federal home ministry announced on Friday that small retail shops could reopen with half their staff, and with the expectation that people physically distance and wear masks and gloves. The stores sell things like food, drinks, and mobile phone cards.

The opening up of neighborhood stores has exceptions: it doesn’t apply to hundreds of quarantined towns and hotspots across the country. And even with the relaxation of rules for these shops, the sale of liquor and other nonessential items is banned, and shops in marketplaces like malls cannot be reopened.

The relaxation of the lockdown comes after India allowed manufacturing and farming to start back up again in rural areas last week, a move designed to give millions of poor wage-earners the ability to start making money again.

India’s lockdown was imposed on its 1.3 billion people with just four hours’ notice on March 24. It was initially expected to last for three weeks but has since been extended until May 3. Under the current stay-at-home rules, people are not to leave their homes unless they’re trying to obtain food, medicine, or other essentials.

India has reported nearly 25,000 cases of coronavirus and 780 deaths, and new teams are being set up to monitor compliance with lockdown rules. Experts say, however, that the government is not testing nearly aggressively enough to properly count cases or fatalities.

India has provided assistance to the poor as the economy has ground to a halt. The government says it has given out about 1,000 rupees ($14) each to more than 350 million people under a state program, and distributed food grains to more than 50 million people and cooking gas bottles to about 10 million people for free.

The relief measures were part of a broader $1.7 trillion rupee stimulus package ($22.5 billion) — but many economists say it hasn’t gone far enough.

India wants to reopen its economy soon. Critics say it’s not doing enough

A Reuters survey of economists predicted that India’s economy is likely to see its worst quarter since the mid-1990s.

“We don’t consider economic stimulus as strong enough to position the economy for a speedy recovery once the pandemic ends,” Prakash Sakpal, Asia economist at ING Bank, told Reuters.

Vinayak Banerjee, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at MIT, has criticized the government for not spending enough money to provide relief to the poor. Roughly 70 million people in India live in extreme poverty — living on under $2 a day.

“I know there’s a concern that what is the use of giving money to people when the markets are closed. But, to begin with, you can tell people that money is coming and create a mood for demand,” he told BBC. “People need reassurance. And the government has to be proactive in reassuring people.”

Banerjee pointed out that the pandemic has added to preexisting problems with consumer demand.

“The economy was already facing a demand slump. The [coronavirus] outbreak is a double whammy and many people have lost their earning capacity. There’s an additional demand slump now,” he said.

A crucial part of a country’s ability to reopen its economy is developing extremely robust testing capacities. Effective testing — especially when coupled with contact tracing — can allow governments to make quarantines more selective and responsive to hot spots.

But India has struggled with testing at the rate that’s appropriate for its enormous population size. As Vox’s Alex Ward has explained, India’s testing regime was shockingly underwhelming in the early stages of the pandemic. In the weeks after the first confirmed case of coronavirus in India, “government officials were only testing people who had traveled internationally or had come into contact with someone who tested positive,” Ward reported. “Because of that focus, India had one of the lowest testing rates in the world as of March 13.”

Moreover, those tests were “weak,” Jayaprakash Muliyil, one of India’s most renowned epidemiologists, said, because they tested for any strain of coronavirus, including SARS and MERS.

Ultimately, India is caught in the same economic dilemma as any other country that has chosen to use sweeping lockdowns to shield the public from the virus. But experts say that attempts to reopen it are going to be challenging.

“India is essentially debating between epidemiological gain versus economic pain,” Aurodeep Nandi, an economist at Nomura, told the Financial Times as manufacturing and agricultural work were starting to reopen. “While the aim is to nudge the economy from lockdown atrophy, the opening will ultimately be on a wing and a prayer that the number of cases does not escalate as India makes its way back to work.”

"['Alex Ward', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,"The rumors of Kim Jong Un’s “grave” illness, explained","North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has become a visible global presence over the last few years. But in the last week, he’s completely disappeared from public view — and rumors have started to swirl that he may be seriously ill, or even dead.

On April 15, Kim didn’t appear at a celebration commemorating North Korea’s most important holiday, which honors the founder of the country, Kim’s late grandfather Kim Il Sung. State-run media oddly hasn’t published any photos of a recent weapons test, which typically show the leader watching in approval. And official statements from the country have curiously lacked any direct comments from Kim himself.

All of this has led to rampant media speculation that the 36-year-old Kim is recovering from major surgery, or gravely ill, or dead, and a flurry of activity by United States intelligence to figure out what, if anything, is really going on.

Meanwhile, North Korean media outlets have kept mum about the swirling rumors and continue to act as if life in the Hermit Kingdom is proceeding as usual. Even as they publish old (or undated) statements from Kim about the economy and other topics, the gist is that there’s nothing to see here and everything is fine.

That could be true. Kim has disappeared for weeks before, only to show up in public as if nothing had happened. The coronavirus has also impacted the country, and the dictator may be taking precautions to avoid infection. Plus, North Korea’s culture of secrecy means rumors can run rampant regardless of how far-fetched they may be.

But Kim is known to be in poor health; he’s obese, he’s a cigarette smoker, and he’s believed to have severe gout.

In my book ""The Great Successor,"" I wrote that Kim Jong Un's biggest risk factor was his obvious poor health -- and in particular the risk of cardiac problems.



Kim Jong Un is five feet, seven inches tall, and weighs about three hundred pounds = BMI of 45, or ""extremely obese"" pic.twitter.com/04EsZfuues — Anna Fifield (@annafifield) April 21, 2020

So when a South Korean outlet run by North Korean defectors insinuated Kim’s absenteeism might be because of post-surgery complications, the plausibility helped make it a global story.

“The possibility that he’s sick in some way is something we have to keep in mind,” Mintaro Oba, a former State Department official specializing in North and South Korea, told me.

It’s important to note that no country — including the two Koreas, China, or the US — has officially confirmed the status of the dictator’s health one way or the other.

Still, it’s worth understanding how the speculation started, what is and isn’t known, and what an incapacitated (or worse) Kim would mean for North Korea and the world.

How rumors of Kim Jong Un’s sickness got started

April 15 is an important day in North Korea. It’s the birthday of Kim Il Sung, North Korea’s revered founder and grandfather of Kim Jong Un.

Every year, the country stops to honor the elder Kim during the “Day of the Sun,” as he’s viewed by many in the country as a deity. He’s also an incredibly important figure in the younger Kim’s reign, as the leader has tried to emulate his grandfather (to the point of even dressing like him) as a way of legitimizing his rule.

That’s why Kim’s absence at the celebration raised so many eyebrows.

“For Kim Jong Un, not visiting the Kumsusan Palace on April 15 is all but unthinkable in North Korea. It’s the closest thing to blasphemy in the North,” Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, told the New York Times.

It was also odd how, just the day before, North Korea had conducted several missile tests. That in itself isn’t unusual, as the regime often conducts such tests around major holidays or important political events (South Korea’s parliamentary elections were also being held the next day).

It was strange, though, that North Korean media was absolutely silent about the tests. Normally, within a few hours of such tests, North Korean state-run media publishes photos of the test that show Kim smiling approvingly at the explosions.

But the rumors that something funky was going on intensified on Monday, April 20, when a South Korean news outlet run by North Korean defectors published a story — citing “multiple sources” — saying Kim had recently undergone heart surgery and was recuperating “at a villa outside of Pyongyang.”

The South Korean outlet later ran a correction explaining that, actually, their report was based on a single (unnamed) source inside North Korea — not “multiple sources.”

But the international news service Reuters still picked up the story, citing the tabloid’s report.

And then CNN upped the ante, publishing a story that cited an unnamed US official saying Kim was in “grave danger” following the surgery. CNN later updated the story to include additional information from other anonymous US officials saying the US was “closely monitoring” intelligence reports about Kim’s health.

It’s unclear what CNN’s sources meant by “monitoring” intelligence reports. It could mean the US has actual information about Kim’s health, or it could simply mean spies were reading the same news stories everyone else was.

Either way, experts say that the CNN story is what turned a small rumor into a global obsession.

Kim Jong Un's health condition is deteriorating rapidly, from Daily NK to Reuters to CNN to my entire Twitter feed. — John Delury (@JohnDelury) April 21, 2020

In an effort to confirm the reports, I called officials in the US and South Korea. White House and State Department staff said the only information they had was from the news, and leaders in South Korea didn’t respond with any sense of alarm.

My sources in South Korea are...let’s say “unmoved”...by rumors of Kim Jong Un’s death.



So far, they don’t seem to be buying anything. Definitely waiting for something concrete. — Alex Ward (@AlexWardVox) April 21, 2020

That Monday night, South Korean officials repeatedly played down the reports of Kim’s health complications, as did some in the Chinese government. Then on Tuesday, President Donald Trump acknowledged the US had no reliable information on the state of the North Korean leader’s health.

“I just hope he’s doing fine,” Trump said during a White House news conference. “I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un. And I’d like to see him do well. We’ll see how he does. We don’t know if the reports are true.”

As of Thursday, there remains no official confirmation from inside North Korea or anywhere else that something is wrong with Kim. But that doesn’t mean the world is just going to wait around to find out.

Why the US needs to know about Kim’s health

Jung Pak, a former top CIA analyst on North Korea and author of a forthcoming book on Kim, wrote a series of tweets on Monday explaining why no one should discount the rumors of Kim’s health.

“Kim Jong Un’s health status is difficult to report on and corroborate because of the regime’s information environment and the sensitivity of such close-hold information about the top leader,” she wrote. “Reliability of the info depends on access, while corroboration would boost confidence level of an assessment. So having one source doesn’t mean that we should ignore it but it should be weighed with what we know and appropriately caveated.”

South Korea and China’s “downplaying of the reports does not mean that they have more access to Kim,” she continued. “Often they too are scrambling for info.”

The US is scrambling, too. Two anonymous US intelligence officials told Newsweek Tuesday that America has no evidence that Kim is in grave danger, though one said analysts are “continuing to monitor reports from regional partners and Korean press.”

But it looks like US intelligence is doing more than just reading reports: Vice on Thursday reported that US surveillance planes have been flying over North Korea to try to suss out what’s going on with Kim. It’s unclear what the aircraft might even be able to find, but some experts believe it’s a purposefully public move to pressure Pyongyang into offering up information about Kim’s status.

There are also some signs of trouble inside North Korea. According to North Korea-focused website NK News, there’s been a lot of “panic buying” at Pyongyang’s grocery stores. Vegetables, flour, and sugar are flying off the shelves, a source told the outlet. Whether or not that’s connected to the Kim rumors is unclear. It’s just as possible that North Koreans are stocking up on food after the regime on Monday announced “tougher state emergency anti-epidemic steps” to combat the coronavirus.

It makes sense, then, that the US would want to know exactly what’s going on instead of just relying on media speculation.

First, it’s just generally a good idea for America to have the most up-to-date information on other countries and their leaders — not just their policies and palace intrigue, but also their state of being. Having that intelligence helps the US government prepare to make decisions today and into the future.

Second, and relatedly, the state of Kim’s health has significant implications for America.

If Kim is healthy but just wants to stay out of sight, it could mean all sorts of things — maybe he’s hunkering down to avoid getting the coronavirus, or perhaps he’s planning some kind of dramatic move. It was shortly after Kim’s long 2014 absence that North Korea launched a massive cyberattack against Sony Pictures for producing the comedy film The Interview, which depicted a CIA plot to kill Kim.

“I give the Kim regime maximum respect, the benefit of doubt. When the top leader is out of public for an extended period, I assume he’s up to serious planning or cramming for the next strategic move instead of bed-ridden or partying all night every night,” said Sung-Yoon Lee, a North Korea expert at Tufts University’s Fletcher School.

If Kim is gravely ill, that’s also really, really important for the US to know, as it immediately raises the question of who exactly is running the country right now.

“What if he is technically ‘alive’ or there is litigation amongst potential successors as for whether he is alive or dead? Who can legally issue orders? What if there are contravening orders?” said Vipin Narang, an MIT expert on North Korea’s nuclear program.

And if it turns out Kim is dead, then there would likely be a succession crisis in the country.

Kim Yo Jong, the supreme leader’s sister, is the current odds-on favorite to take over. She’s recently taken on a more prominent role in the country, even putting out her own statements and meeting foreign leaders face to face.

But Sheena Greitens, a North Korea expert at the University of Missouri, noted in the Washington Post on Wednesday, reason to be more skeptical of this possibility. “Female inheritance in modern dictatorships is essentially unheard of, and North Korea watchers debate whether and how North Korea’s political culture might adapt to a female ruler,” she wrote.

Another possibility, according to the Victoria University of Wellington’s Van Jackson, is that the country’s armed forces take over. “That’s generally bad” for the US, he told me, especially because North Korea’s military “tends to be the most predictably hawkish toward the US.”

To consolidate power and legitimacy, there’s a chance the ruling general would take provocative actions, such as launching a missile closer to the US than ever before. At that point, any remaining goodwill between Pyongyang and Washington would wither away.

Again, all of this is complete speculation. Kim could be just fine, smoking a cigarette in one of his palaces right now, biding his time before he shows his face in public again.

In fact, this isn’t even the first time this sort of thing has happened. In 2014, Kim wasn’t seen in public for five weeks, during which he missed a major holiday commemorating the founding of the ruling party. At the time, speculation about why he was absent ranged from him nursing a hangover, suffering from gout, or having been overthrown in a coup.

And earlier this year, as the coronavirus raged in China and South Korea, the dictator kept inside for three weeks before showing up in February to honor his late father Kim Jong Il’s birthday.

But he could also be so ill that the future of his country — and the future of US policy toward it — are in serious flux. After all, in 2011, it took two days before North Korean officials finally announced that Kim Jong Il had died.

That’s why US and world officials want to confirm or dispel the rumors for themselves. Certainty in tumultuous times is helpful, and there’s little more troubling than a rogue nuclear state without someone in charge.",vox,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/23/21232665/north-korea-kim-jong-un-coronavirus-sick
"['Jen Kirby', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,"26 million US unemployed, 265 million worldwide at risk of hunger: Thursday’s coronavirus news","Another 4 million-plus Americans filed unemployment claims last week, bringing the total to a staggering 26 million in just five weeks.

The House of Representatives is expected to approve the latest $484 billion stimulus package on Thursday. It will largely set aside more money for the Paycheck Protection Program, created by the last stimulus bill, which offers loan guarantees for small businesses.

And lawmakers are already discussing the possibility of a fourth package, with more economic relief, particularly to states. But it’s not clear how big the appetite is for another round of stimulus in some parts of Congress.

The economic catastrophe isn’t confined to the United States, either; the entire world is expected to see what the credit rating agency Fitch Ratings on Wednesday called “a recession of unprecedented depth in the post-war period.”

And the world’s poorest are the most vulnerable. The World Food Program, a United Nations agency, said the pandemic could push approximately 265 million people to the brink of starvation.

Here’s what you need to know today.

26 million unemployed in the US

More than 4.4 million people filed jobless claims the week ending April 18. That brings the total to 26 million over the five-week period during which many businesses have remained shut. The staggering numbers could add some fuel to the movement to start reopening economies, even though the coronavirus crisis has not abated.

The big question now: How much worse is it going to get? The number of filings has declined somewhat since late March and early April, when claims reached peaks of more than 6 million.

But as Vox’s Ella Nilsen reports, the unprecedented crisis has overwhelmed unemployment insurance systems across the country. These systems vary from state to state, with some more equipped to handle claims than others. That could mean a delay between when people lose their jobs and can actually apply for benefits.

Fitch Ratings revised its global economic outlook (GEO) on Wednesday, saying “World GDP is now expected to fall by 3.9% in 2020,” and that “This is twice as large as the decline anticipated in our early April GEO update and would be twice as severe as the 2009 recession.”

And the prospect of a quick bounce-back after the pandemic subsides has all but faded. As the Washington Post reported Wednesday, economists are now concerned about what they call a “W-shaped” recovery, which would happen if the US reopens too quickly and then must abruptly close again because the coronavirus resurges and because of lag time in bankruptcies and defaults.

“Pretending the world will return to normal in three months or six months is just wrong,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, told the Post. “The economy went into an ice age overnight. We’re in a deep freeze. As the economy thaws, we’ll see the damage done as well. Flooding will occur.”

The House is expected to approve the latest round of stimulus

The Senate passed a $484 stimulus bill earlier this week that’s mostly funding to keep small businesses afloat. Members of the House of Representatives are returning to Capitol Hill (after a resolution to allow members to vote remotely got pulled) to vote on the package Thursday. The bill is expected to pass, though some progressive lawmakers have said the package doesn’t go far enough.

The package mostly provides an influx of cash to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which has already run out of the $349 billion initially set aside to give small businesses forgivable loans. This latest legislation will allocate another $320 billion for the program.

Of that, $60 billion will be earmarked for community-based lenders, like credit unions, small banks, and nonprofits, which is intended to increase access to the program by minority-owned, rural, and other businesses. Another $60 billion will go to another type of emergency loan program.

The rest of the money in the package will more directly address the health care crisis, giving a $75 billion influx to hospitals and setting aside $25 million for expanding nationwide testing capacity. These are concessions Democrats won in this bill, though they failed to secure additional money for states and local governments whose budgets have been depleted by the coronavirus pandemic.

But this bill is merely a temporary salve to the economic pain that America is experiencing, which is why top Democrats are calling it an “interim” bill — a bridge from the $2 trillion CARES Act passed in late March to some as-yet-undetermined CARES 2 package.

Money for states and localities will likely top the list of things that Democrats want to go into that CARES 2 package, though they’re likely to push for even more ambitious plans; some have proposed hazard pay for front-line workers, and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has introduced a bill to forgive rent and mortgages during the pandemic.

But getting those measures passed might not be so easy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested that he’s not super keen on the idea of giving more money to states, saying on a radio program that states should consider bankruptcy — which, as Vox’s Li Zhou points out, is “a process almost all states currently cannot use.”

Which means a much bigger political battle might erupt for the next round of stimulus. But Thursday’s unemployment numbers suggest America is going to need a lot more aid before this is over.

Another crisis caused by the coronavirus: Hunger

Global coronavirus cases have now topped 2.6 million, with more than 185,000 deaths. The pandemic has spread to nearly every corner of the world, and by the day, the coronavirus is more acutely threatening the most vulnerable parts of the globe.

On Wednesday, a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon confirmed its first coronavirus case. Last week, Kurdish officials confirmed the first coronavirus death in northeastern Syria. Earlier this month, Yemen also confirmed its first coronavirus infection.

The threat of a virulent pandemic in these places is obvious: It is impossible to social distance or access adequate sanitation in a refugee camp. Those internally displaced or still living in war-torn areas also deal with poor infrastructure, insufficient medical care, and a lack of critical supplies.

Add the global economic crisis and the situation is even more dire for low- and middle-income countries. For example, global remittances — money sent from people working overseas back home — are expected to dip more than 20 percent this year, from $714 billion to $572 billion, according to the World Bank. That wipes out billions of dollars that make up a significant chunk of many countries’ economies.

Taken together, these economic realities are exacerbating another problem: hunger. The UN’s World Food Program is estimating that the number of people facing starvation in 2020 could double, to 265 million.

“These new projections show the scale of the catastrophe we are facing,” WFP chief economist Arif Husain said in a statement. “We must make sure that tens of millions of people already on the verge of starvation do not succumb to this virus or to its economic consequences in terms of loss of jobs and incomes.”

Beasley, WFP’s executive director and former Republican governor of South Carolina, has requested the UN expedite $2 billion in pledged aid to the program, and an additional $350 million for logistical support, to get aid where it’s needed in a world where international travel is shut down.

“We are looking at widespread famines of biblical proportions,” Beasley told the Guardian.

And some good news

The New York City Council on Wednesday proposed an “Essential Workers’ Bill of Rights” as part of a big legislative package to deal with the fallout of the coronavirus, according to Gothamist.

The bill would require companies to provide hazard pay to front-line workers (anyone deemed essential under New York’s stay-at-home orders) during the pandemic. Specifically, it would require companies with more than 100 essential workers to offer bonuses depending on the hours employees are working; for example, a $60 bonus for four- to eight-hour shifts. It would last for as long as the lockdown orders are in place.

This is part of a broader plan to help gig workers, individual and commercial renters, and homeless people. The bad news here is that it’s not clear whether it will actually go anywhere, and whether the city will face additional budget constraints because of the pandemic.

But it’s still good news because it may add to the reorienting of how America sees its essential workforce. As Vox’s Emily Stewart writes, “the reality is that essential workers in the midst of the coronavirus crisis are fast-food workers, social workers, cleaners, retail associates, transit workers, home health aides, and even those who provide support for victims of domestic violence. They’re often not highly paid individuals, and they’re risking their lives.”

The Democratic proposal in the US Senate to offer hazard pay and New York’s packet of bills at least show that how the country sees essential workers might be changing for the better. As one retail worker told Stewart: “Honestly, I just kind of wish if we’re considered essential, maybe we’d be paid [as] essential.”

"['Alex Ward', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,“A major outbreak and a major collapse”: South America’s worrying coronavirus future,"South America has so far been spared the worst of the coronavirus. But experts warn that a large-scale outbreak in the region is bound to happen — and when it does, it will roil fragile countries already struggling to care for their people.

Since the continent’s first official case was confirmed in Brazil on February 26, South America has seen more than 83,000 cases and nearly 4,000 deaths as of April 20. Those numbers are lower than in much of the world.

There are a couple of good reasons for that: First, several governments in the region took swift action to lock down their countries within just a few weeks of identifying their first cases of coronavirus. Second, international travel to much of the region isn’t extensive, which means the virus was slower to spread from hot spots like China and Europe to many parts of the continent.

But there’s another, more disturbing reason the number of cases may be so low: Testing isn’t widespread. That means most leaders in South America are flying blind as to the extent of what’s likely a larger outbreak.

“We don’t have a clear picture of how Covid-19 is infecting our societies,” Dr. Carissa Etienne, the World Health Organization’s top official for the Americas, told reporters on Tuesday. “When combined with other public health measures, testing can be a powerful tool to manage the pandemic and save lives.”

Implementation of those other measures has also been mixed across the region, with countries varying wildly on the extent of their lockdowns. That lack of a coherent regional response is why experts fear South America’s time as a global coronavirus epicenter is coming.

That would be catastrophic for the region of over 430 million people. About one-tenth of the region is already severely impoverished, with one estimate showing another 35 million could join those ranks as a result of the pandemic. And in some areas, dead bodies already line major city streets.

“We are going to have a major outbreak and a major collapse in the near future,” Tatiana Bertolucci, the Latin America chief for the humanitarian group CARE, told me.

South America’s early response to the coronavirus was generally pretty good. But it wasn’t enough.

South America had an early advantage over other parts of the world, Evangelina Martich, an Argentine expert on health policy at the University of Carlos III in Spain, told me. “The virus’s relative late arrival allowed those countries to see what happened elsewhere and prepare,” she said.

When the virus finally did hit the continent, several countries acted quickly.

Argentina recorded its first coronavirus case on March 3 and imposed a countrywide lockdown on March 20. Peru’s first case was announced on March 6, and the country went on total lockdown on March 17. Venezuela, which was already suffering from one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world before the pandemic, enacted a lockdown just four days after its first cases were confirmed on March 13.

By contrast, Spain — the world’s second-hardest-hit country — had its first case on January 31 and didn’t impose a lockdown until March 15.

Experts I spoke to say those early moves undoubtedly kept many more people from getting sick.

However, they also note the dearth of testing means there’s a good chance true infection numbers are higher than officially reported. “I definitely believe that South America is in worse shape than it’s showing,” CARE’s Bertolucci told me.

There’s also wide variation among countries when it comes to how seriously their governments and citizens are taking the virus.

In Argentina, for example, the government quickly closed the country’s borders and imposed a lockdown. In Brazil, on the other hand, President Jair Bolsonaro has resisted calls for a nationwide lockdown and even attended a rally against such measures that have been implemented by some state governors in the country. He continues to downplay the threat of the virus, and last week fired his top health official for contradicting him.

The result is that Argentina has about 3,000 cases and 140 deaths while Brazil alone accounts for approximately half of all the cases and deaths on the entire continent.

Peru, which closed its borders early and imposed a lockdown, still sees hundreds of people in close quarters at markets. “It’s impossible to move around without bumping into people,” Mayumi Matto, a 28-year-old in the capital Lima, told the Washington Post last week. “Everyone is in a hurry to get in and out as quickly as possible, without getting infected. Security try telling people to keep their distance, but it’s no use.”

The country now has South America’s second-highest number of cases as of April 20.

Ecuador, which also imposed a curfew, has endured horrific scenes. As the New York Times reported last week, the country’s business capital of Guayaquil has seen bodies strewn about streets or placed in makeshift coffins made of cardboard. Thousands of dead were collected from homes after they failed to receive adequate medical care.

Again, the reason seems to be that the country’s leaders and citizens lagged adopting social distancing policies.

One reason why so many people are ignoring or violating these policies, though, is poverty.

More than 50 percent of the region’s population works in the informal economy as street vendors, musicians, or something else. Those people are typically very poor and therefore can’t afford to store food at home — if they have a home — which may also house multiple families.

“People are more worried about being able to feed their families than they are about the coronavirus,” Liliana Pérez, an Argentine mother of six who lives in a slum with her family, told the Guardian on Tuesday.

“My kids haven’t eaten properly since the quarantine began,” María Ticona, a mother of five in Bolivia, also told the Guardian.

All of this means that South America is almost assuredly headed for a major public health crisis. And the region’s bigger structural problems will make it that much harder for countries to address it.

“The most vulnerable populations always will suffer the most”

As the number of coronavirus cases ticks up in South America, health care systems on the continent will find themselves quickly overwhelmed.

“Hospital beds, health professionals, and medical supplies in general such as ventilators were already in short supply even before the start of the pandemic,” Sara Niedzwiecki, an expert on health care systems in South America at the University of California Santa Cruz, told me. “After Covid-19 [hits], the fear of the health system collapsing is very real,” adding, “health service shortage is a challenge for every country in South America.”

The chart below shows how many hospital beds each country in South America has available per 1,000 people, based on 2014 World Bank data. As you can see, all but one of the regional countries have fewer than three hospital beds for every 1,000 people. Argentina is the only exception, with five per every 1,000 people.

South America is also nearing its flu season as the southern hemisphere heads into winter. Experts say the flu will increase the number of people seeking medical attention. The region also continues to struggle with other major diseases like dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya, all of which require tremendous resources to treat and ultimately eradicate.

“The combination is really scary,” CARE’s Bertolucci told me.

It doesn’t help that countries seeking necessary equipment like masks and ventilators are getting outbid by richer countries. Most South American governments are also still reeling from the 2008 financial crisis and are deeply in debt.

Which means that even if regional leaders wanted to spend more money to address the looming crisis, they’d basically have to put themselves in longer-term economic jeopardy. “It’s not easy to take on more debt because these countries are already very indebted,” the University of Chicago’s Michael Albertus told me.

And the economic situation is only going to get worse as the global economy heads into a recession. Local economies are heavily dependent on commodity exports, primarily oil from Venezuela and Ecuador or precious metals like copper and zinc from Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. Without foreign trade and with few intra-continental sales, local economies and governments will lose the revenue they need to fight off the disease.

All of that is especially bad news for the region’s poor, which make up about 30 percent of the continent’s total population. Their difficulties paying for medical care or purchasing food means they will be the ones to suffer most during the crisis, experts say. After all, millions live in slums and don’t have free or reliable access to water, meaning the ability to socially distance or wash hands for 20 seconds just isn’t really a possibility.

“The most vulnerable populations always will suffer the most,” the University of Carlos III’s Martich told me.

"['Jen Kirby', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,"A new first US coronavirus death, a “second wave” warning: Wednesday’s coronavirus news","The first coronavirus death in the United States may have been weeks earlier than anybody thought.

The first deaths attributed to the coronavirus in the US were recorded on February 26 in a suburb of Seattle, Washington. Until now.

On Tuesday, officials in Santa Clara County, California, announced that autopsies of two individuals who died in their homes on February 6 and February 17 show that they died from Covid-19.

This dramatically alters the timeline of when, and how, the virus spread in the United States before the explosion of cases the country saw in March and April. And it could help the country better prepare for a possible second wave of the coronavirus, which the director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday could arrive in the winter and be “even more difficult than the one we just went through.”

But if and when that second waves happens, if you happen to receive a text message from a friend of a friend who’s uncle works for Homeland Security and is worried about a looming nationwide lockdown, you should definitely think twice before rushing out to buy 30-packs of toilet paper — because that text message might have been spread by Chinese operatives.

Here’s what you need to know today.

America’s first coronavirus death may have been in early February

The timeline for the coronavirus in the United States is shifting. On Tuesday, health officials in Santa Clara, California, said autopsies for two individuals showed they had died from Covid-19 in early and mid-February.

Originally, the US’s first recorded death was believed to be in Kirkland, Washington, on February 29, but that was later updated after officials linked two deaths on February 26 to the coronavirus. The examination was based on testing tissue samples, which were confirmed by the CDC.

But now, according to Santa Clara County officials, the first death actually occurred on February 6. The second came on February 17, more than a week earlier than the victims in Washington state.

Sara Cody, the county’s public health officer, said that the individuals who died did not have any known travel histories, including to China, that would have exposed them to the virus, though more investigation might still be needed.

This suggests the coronavirus was spreading in communities in the United States far earlier than officials may have anticipated. “Each one of those deaths is probably the tip of an iceberg of unknown size,” Cody said in an interview with the New York Times. “It feels quite significant.”

The coronavirus crisis is fast-moving, and the lack of widespread testing — especially in the early weeks of the pandemic, when testing narrowly focused on people who had traveled to China — means that cases of coronavirus went undiagnosed, and deaths from the virus almost certainly have gone unrecorded.

CDC warns of a “second wave” of the coronavirus

On Tuesday, CDC director Robert Redfield said in an interview with the Washington Post that another wave of the coronavirus this winter could be far more deadly for the United States.

“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” Redfield said. “And when I’ve said this to others, they kind of put their head back, they don’t understand what I mean.”

The coronavirus is already taxing the US health care system as hospitals struggle to acquire enough personal protective gear to keep workers healthy and to expand capacity to treat patients who may need hospital or ICU beds and ventilators.

But the coronavirus only really began to spike in late March and April in the United States, toward the end of what’s considered flu season. (The CDC describes the flu as traditionally peaking between late December and February.)

If a second wave of coronavirus cases were to hit this winter, at the same time the flu is raging, the situation could get even more dire.

The flu accounts for between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths in the US annually, according to CDC data, and between 140,000 to 810,000 hospitalizations. Add a bad flu season to the coronavirus pandemic — which has killed at least 45,600 Americans since at least February — and it could cripple health systems across the country. (Americans don’t stop having heart attacks and strokes in a pandemic, either.)

Redfield warned that states and local governments need to prepare now, but it’s a reminder of just how much worse this coronavirus outbreak can be, especially as some groups and states agitate to lift stay-at-home orders.

There is still no proven treatment for the coronavirus, and a vaccine is unlikely to be available for, in the rosiest of estimates, at least a year. Americans may very well have to shut down once again, maybe for even longer periods of time — which means even if economies start to reopen and infections diminish right now, testing, contact tracing, and stockpiling of critical supplies all need to keep happening.

That scary text message about an impending national lockdown? Chinese intelligence might have helped spread it.

In mid-March, as US states began shutting down businesses, canceling mass events, and closing schools, text messages began circulating warning the Trump administration was about to implement a national lockdown.

The National Security Council described these message as “FAKE” (and despite the Trumpian language, they were, in fact, fake) and asked people to follow CDC guidance.

Now, the New York Times is reporting that Chinese agents may have tried to amplify and spread those messages, though US intelligence officials do not believe Beijing created them.

Per the Times:

Since that wave of panic, United States intelligence agencies have assessed that Chinese operatives helped push the messages across platforms, according to six American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss intelligence matters. The amplification techniques are alarming to officials because the disinformation showed up as texts on many Americans’ cellphones, a tactic that several of the officials said they had not seen before.

It turns out China has a pretty good playbook to borrow from, specifically the Russian government’s attempts to spread misinformation online during the 2016 election.

A coronavirus pandemic that scientists are trying to learn about in real time and about which even official health guidance is changing as new facts emerge is the perfect petri dish for misinformation to spread and take hold. Especially when it’s amplified by people in positions of power.

The tensions between the US and China over the coronavirus are growing, with both Democrats and Republicans seeking to hold Beijing accountable for its mishandling of the virus. The Trump administration and the president’s Republican allies are also trying to shunt blame for their own missteps in the early days of the crisis.

China has been publicly promoting conspiracy theories against Americans and foreigners in general in an attempt to deflect blame for its failures in containing the virus; but it seems the Chinese government may also be using more low-key disinformation tactics to sow chaos and seed distrust in institutions.

In the middle of both a public health and an economic crisis, this is particularly dangerous, as access to real, accurate information is literally a matter of life and death.

And some good news

It’s Earth Day. And while most of us can’t fully enjoy the glories of the planet while in lockdown, the effects of shutting humans in their homes has given the planet some literal breathing space. The animals are coming out. Air pollution has fallen sharply.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan, Brian Resnick, and Eliza Barclay explain:

Air pollution is a deadly threat, killing millions around the world every year. It’s also linked to more severe outcomes for Covid-19. Conversely, the economic slowdown stemming from Covid-19 showed that reducing pollution yields massive benefits for public health. One researcher estimated that the drop in air pollution in China saved 20 times as many lives as were lost to the virus. And China isn’t the only place seeing clearer skies. In the United Kingdom, nitrogen dioxide pollution fell 60 percent after the country implemented a lockdown compared to the year prior. A nationwide lockdown in India revealed skylines and mountain vistas that had been obscured for decades.

Of course, the social, economic, and public health costs of the coronavirus are not exactly a sustainable trade-off. But at the very least, post-pandemic, the world might start to wonder if there can’t be a balance between a healthy economy and a healthier planet.

“[I]t’s worth asking why we tolerated so much dirty air for the sake of the economy for so long and whether there’s a better way,” the Vox writers note.

I mean, look at the views!

What nature really is and how we screwed it up.

"['Colin P. Clarke Ariane Tabatabai', 'Colin P. Clarke', 'Ariane Tabatabai', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Why Iran is still attacking American troops during the pandemic,"Iran has been decimated by the spread of the novel coronavirus, with more than 83,000 diagnosed cases and 5,200 deaths as of April 20 — at least according to official figures, which are likely much lower than the real numbers. One official from the country’s medical council estimates that the total number of positive cases could be as high as half a million.

The country’s economy is in shambles, to the point that the Iranian government has chosen to resume what President Hassan Rouhani calls “low-risk business activities,” even as public health experts in the country warn of the consequences and urge Iranians to continue to stay at home. And the drastic drop in the price of crude oil will only serve to further weaken Iran’s already weakened economy.

But if you thought a deadly pandemic and staggering economic crisis would be enough to convince Iran to at least pause its efforts to confront the United States in the Middle East, you’d be wrong.

Despite the crippling toll of the pandemic, which has infected several high-ranking members of the regime as well as untold numbers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Tehran has continued to work tirelessly to eject the last remaining US forces from Iraq and consolidate its influence over the Iraqi political establishment.

It’s largely doing so through the proxy militia groups it supports in Iraq, which in recent weeks have launched attacks targeting US forces and assets in that country, including one that killed two Americans on March 11. Last week, the IRGC resumed provocative actions in the Persian Gulf, harassing the US Navy there.

The @CJTFOIR confirms at least (25) 107mm rockets impacted Iraq's Camp Taji base hosting Coalition troops, March 14 at 10:51 a.m. (Iraq Time). 3-Coalition WIA, 2-Iraqi WIA.

Caggins III (@OIRSpox) March 14, 2020

So why, in the midst of grappling with an out-of-control pandemic and an economy in free fall, would Tehran devote time and money to fighting the US? The answer, at least in part, is that the Iranian government believes the United States is particularly weak right now, too.

With Washington’s ineptitude on full display in its domestic response to the coronavirus, few people outside of a select group of Iran hawks — which includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — have much of an appetite for continued clashes with Iranian proxies in Iraq or incidents with the IRGC in the Persian Gulf right now.

The United States is also a convenient scapegoat and distraction that the Iranian regime regularly uses to deflect attention from its own failures.

Facing growing criticism at home and abroad for their abysmal response to the Covid-19 outbreak, Iranian leaders have tried to shift the blame to the US — particularly the stringent economic sanctions Washington has placed on the country, which Iranian leaders say (not entirely unfairly) are hampering the country’s ability to respond to the pandemic.

An Iranian disinformation campaign and a well-resourced propaganda effort have also spread the conspiracy theory that the US and Israel — typical Iranian foils — were responsible for starting the coronavirus pandemic. State media and social media accounts have also been creating and amplifying content in an effort to highlight the poor response to the disease and partisan infighting in the United States.

So while some observers may have expected Iran’s leaders to suspend some of their aggressive activities in order to devote their full attention to dealing with the coronavirus outbreak at home, the reality is the opposite: Iran is actually ramping up its fight against the US.

The coronavirus pandemic has presented Iran with a unique opportunity to challenge the US

The US assassination of Qassem Soleimani on January 3, 2020, was intended to not only take Iran’s most capable military figure off the battlefield but also to “reestablish deterrence” — that is, to raise the stakes so that Iranian-backed militias in Iraq would think twice about attacking US forces in the country going forward.

However, a series of recent attacks shows that far from being cowed, these militias appear to have been emboldened. In all likelihood, Iran is only in the nascent stages of responding to the death of Soleimani.

In part, Iran and its proxies are carrying out the strategy they announced back in January. After an initial aggressive response in the form of missile attacks against two bases in Iraq housing US troops, Iran vowed to continue the fight until America was pushed out of Iraq. And it was clear that this mission would not be carried out directly and overtly by Tehran but, in classic Iranian form, via its proxies.

But Tehran could not have anticipated then that a global pandemic would provide the backdrop for these continued tensions with its adversary. And the public health crisis is increasing the sense of urgency surrounding Iran’s efforts in Iraq and accelerating its timelines.

The coronavirus pandemic sweeping throughout the world has led the United States to draw down its forces, repositioning soldiers within Iraq and consolidating troops to fewer bases. US special forces soldiers have been withdrawn from some of the world’s most dangerous active conflict zones, leaving local host-nation forces to contend with an array of well-equipped and battle-hardened terrorists, insurgents, and militias.

This has presented Iran with a unique opportunity to expand and consolidate its control in Iraq and push the US entirely out. And the country’s leaders aren’t going to squander their chance.

From Tehran, the United States looks at its weakest in years. The country is struggling to formulate a coherent and effective response to Covid-19. The divisions between the United States and its traditional allies are glaring. In terms of US-Iran tensions, US allies in Europe place much of the blame on America, not the Islamic Republic.

In the region, the US is being pressured, and at home, there’s a deep discontent with the status quo on both sides of the aisle. So, Tehran is resuming the actions that nearly brought the two countries to the brink of war throughout 2019, including proxy attacks in Iraq and on-again, off-again harassment in the Persian Gulf.

To remind America and its allies who’s winning in Syria, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif visited Damascus on Monday to meet with Assad. Zarif’s visit is both practical and symbolic, a means of face-to-face planning for what both countries see as the final phase of the Syrian conflict and as a photo opportunity to remind the world that the United States’ role in Syria has reached a nadir.

Washington will have little, if any, role in shaping the future of Syria while Tehran and Moscow divvy up the spoils, including access to strategically important bases.

Iran may pull back from other less important regional battlefields during the pandemic. But not Iraq.

Another consequence of the pandemic could very well be that Iran scales back its regional ambitions, at least for the immediate future, and channels its resources to focus on its immediate neighbors — Iraq and Afghanistan.

Prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, Iran would have viewed this as a downgrading of its regional standing, but now that America is drawing down in the region too, this may actually be a net positive for the Islamic Republic. After all, Iran has already effectively achieved its objectives in Syria and Yemen and no longer needs to maintain a robust presence in those countries.

In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad — a close Iranian ally — is now firmly in control of the country and no longer at risk of falling to pro-democracy rebels or Sunni Islamist militants (both outcomes Iran desperately wanted to avoid).

In Yemen, Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia and its allies have been bogged down by a group of rebels. Riyadh has suffered a blow to its reputation, as civilian casualties continue to mount in Yemen, putting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi leadership at odds with influential members of the US Congress.

A more targeted foreign policy could yield results for Iran, especially if the regime is able to stack a series of victories in quick succession. The crown jewels of this strategy include consolidating control over Shia foreign fighter militias in Syria and pushing the United States out of Iraq once and for all.

The visit of Soleimani’s successor, IRGC-Quds Force Commander Maj. Gen. Esmail Qaani, to Baghdad in late March was met with a statement from US President Donald Trump warning Iran not to move forward with what he labeled a planned “sneak attack” on US forces, suggesting “Iran will pay a very heavy price” if it chooses to do so.

But the United States would be wise to show constraint in its approach toward Iran. The Soleimani assassination backfired in the sense that it empowered anti-American elements within Iraq and helped elevate Iraqi politicians that are determined to concede to Iran’s wishes and hasten the withdrawal of American troops.

Of course, the United States shouldn’t just sit on its hands if Iranian attacks claim US lives, but any US response should be properly calibrated and proportional. Moving forward, the Trump administration should work to introduce potential off-ramps that allow the two countries to pause their conflict as they (and the rest of the international community) focus on addressing the global pandemic.

And once the US finally gets a handle on its own coronavirus outbreak, it should make a concerted effort to demonstrate goodwill toward Iran. Choosing this path is both the right thing to do and is in the US’s interest. This extends to rather simple steps like making it easier for Iran to acquire medical devices and medicine, including tests and masks.

This would go a long way toward debunking Iran’s propaganda, which claims the United States has sanctioned humanitarian goods, such as medical equipment and medicine (it hasn’t).

In the end, it could end up achieving much more than any drone strike is able to.

"['Jen Kirby', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,"States start to reopen, Oktoberfest canceled: Tuesday’s coronavirus news","The great coronavirus lockdown is beginning to unwind in some parts of the United States, with several governors announcing an easing of restrictions in their states in the coming days and weeks. Whether this will be safe — or whether Americans will even want to go back to gyms and restaurants yet — is, alarmingly, still an open question.

That hasn’t stopped governors in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and other states from loosening measures, some even before the end of the month. But in both the US and abroad, major public events are being cleared from the calendar as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases tops 2.5 million worldwide.

On Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled the city’s Pride March and Puerto Rican Day parades scheduled for June; on Tuesday, he indicated July 4th fireworks were also unlikely. The German state of Bavaria has canceled Oktoberfest, and Spain has canceled the running of the bulls in Pamplona. The suspension of these mass events makes sense amid the uncertainty of the pandemic, but it’s a reminder that normality is not returning anytime soon.

President Donald Trump has been pushing hard for the country to reopen, but he’s suddenly decided that in one very specific area things should be shut down even further: immigration. He announced a vague declaration via tweet Monday night that he was temporarily suspending immigration to the United States. What that actually means is still unclear, though, as the coronavirus pandemic has already de facto halted immigration to the US.

Here’s what you need to know today.

Some US states look to reopen

As of April 21, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States has exceeded 788,000, and the death toll sits at more than 42,000. The crisis is not over, but some states are still beginning to ease lockdown measures in an attempt to restart their economies.

President Trump’s federal social distancing guidelines are in effect until the end of April, but some states are aiming for more accelerated timelines. In Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has said gyms, hair and nail salons, and bowling alleys can open by Friday if they follow social distancing rules, screen workers for fevers, and enforce mask-wearing. Starting next Monday, April 27, movie theaters will be allowed to reopen, and restaurants in the state will be allowed to resume limited dine-in service. Bars and nightclubs, however, will remain closed.

Kemp, a Trump ally, imposed lockdown restrictions in early April, a lot later than other states (he claimed he had just learned about asymptomatic transmission), and many mayors and public health officials in the state say Georgia’s move to end the lockdown is far too premature.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Bottoms said she hadn’t been consulted about Kemp’s decision ahead of time. “But as I look at the data and as I talk with our public health officials, I don’t see that it’s based on anything that’s logical,” she said.

Some business owners in Georgia are skeptical, too. “I’d rather stay closed an extra week and wipe this thing out than to open prematurely, have a second wave and have to shut down again,” Patrick Godley, a restaurant owner in Savannah, Georgia, told the AP.

Georgia isn’t the only state where measures are being lifted. In Florida, which had recorded 839 coronavirus-related deaths as of Tuesday morning, Republican Gov. Rick DeSantis reopened some beaches. In South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster reopened some stores that had previously been deemed nonessential, like book stores and flea markets; public boat ramps will also start to reopen, along with some beaches, according to the AP. In Tennessee and Ohio (both of which are led by Republican governors, though Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine took early action to close schools and businesses), businesses are expected to be allowed open on May 1, after the 30-day federal social distancing guidelines lapse.

Last week, the administration put out a plan for a phased reopening of the economy that lays out specific benchmarks states need to meet before moving through the different phases. These include seeing a 14-day decline in reports of Covid-like illnesses and a “downward trajectory” of positive tests, and having robust testing in place. It’s not clear that all of these states have met those benchmarks; in South Carolina, for example, Linda Bell, the state’s top epidemiologist, said there was a “leveling off” of cases but no sure decline, according to the AP.

So this will be something of a test — one, as to whether coronavirus cases will resurge if these states move too swiftly to reopen, and two, whether people will feel safe enough to return to stores and beaches. Right now, public opinion doesn’t seem to suggest many Americans feel secure: A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, conducted April 14-19, found that only 10 percent of Americans polled believed gatherings of 10 or more would be safe by the end of April; 21 percent said the end of May, 20 percent said June, and 19 percent said later in the summer.

Trump finds an immigration angle (of course)

States are reopening, but Trump wants more shutdowns — on immigration, at least. Trump decided to drop a 10 pm tweet on Monday announcing that he would be signing an executive order temporarily suspending all immigration to the United States.

That’s it. No further details included.

In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2020

As of time of writing, this executive order is evidently still being drafted, so it’s still not totally clear how this will work and what the legal justification will be. The order is allegedly intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and protect jobs for American workers. Per the Washington Post:

For Trump’s executive order to work, it would have to direct the State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to immediately stop the issuance of immigration visas. Such a move appears to have no modern precedent and would potentially leave the fiancees, children and other close relatives of U.S. citizens in limbo.

Somehow, this announcement is both an extraordinary move and an extraordinary distraction from the actual crisis that’s happening in the US around the coronavirus. Even before Trump’s tweet, as the New York Times points out, the regular channels of immigration had largely been closed off because of the pandemic. The US has imposed widespread travel restrictions, canceled routine visa and immigration appointments worldwide, and implemented a policy denying entry to asylum-seekers.

Trump’s order would presumably go even further, barring green cards and work visas for a still-unspecified period of time. Though, again, the administration’s plans are still unclear.

There is not much to back up the idea that stopping legal immigration is going to somehow curb the threat of the coronavirus or protect American workers.

The United States — not some other country — is now the world’s hot spot for coronavirus cases, with nearly 800,000 of the world’s 2.5 million confirmed cases.

As for protecting Americans jobs, the country’s economic woes largely exist because businesses are shut down and people are staying home, not because immigrants are taking jobs from US citizens.

On top of that, prior to this announcement, the Trump administration actually made it easier for some immigrants to enter because they’re basically helping keep the economy afloat right now. Per Politico:

Specifically, the U.S. eased requirements for immigrants to get certain jobs, such as farmworkers, landscapers and crab pickers, aware that certain industries, including those that fill grocery store shelves, could be hurt during the pandemic if they couldn’t hire foreign employees. It has also begun easing the process for companies looking to hire foreign workers, altering some paperwork requirements, including allowing electronic signatures and waiving the physical inspection of documents.

As Vox’s Nicole Narea writes, “if the executive order does not exempt workers in essential fields, it could have a devastating effect on health care and agriculture.” As Narea explains, hospitals are facing staff shortages because of the virus’s toll on health care workers, and farmers have worried about potential labor shortages among agricultural workers that could threaten the food supply.

Germany says “nein” to Oktoberfest (and a bunch of other countries canceled stuff, too)

Mass gatherings have largely been canceled in the age of the coronavirus. And even as countries slowly, slowly begin to ease restrictions, meeting in very large groups remains verboten.

New York City’s Pride March, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, was officially canceled on Monday. Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, which is supposed to start in mid-September, was also nixed. The event usually draws in about 6 million visitors, according to Reuters. And it usually brings the city more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion).

“A decision that saddens us all: It affects me, deeply and personally. A festival for millions, which stands for Munich, for the joy of life, for Bavaria, cannot take place,” said Clemens Baumgärtner, the head of Oktoberfest, according to USA Today.

Oktoberfest has been canceled because of pandemics before, most notably cholera in 1854, according to NPR. But the last time it was officially canceled was during World War II.

Spain’s San Fermin festival in early July has also been canceled, and along with it the legendary running of the bulls (though maybe that’s not such a bad thing?). And an expert in Japan said this week that even a Tokyo Olympics in 2021 might not be feasible.

All of these cancellations are a good reminder that even as countries begin to reopen their economies, life will still be far from “normal” for the foreseeable future.

And some good news

Apparently the only places where fun is happening during the pandemic are aquariums.

"['Hj Mai', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,The coronavirus could tear the EU apart,"Almost as soon as the coronavirus arrived in Europe, countries began turning inward, putting their own citizens’ needs first and ignoring pleas for help from their neighbors. European Union member states closed their borders for the first time in decades, and competed against each other for vital medical supplies, including ventilators.

But the biggest rifts between the nations have opened up during recent negotiations over an economic rescue package, which pitted richer countries against poorer ones — just like during the eurozone debt crisis at the beginning of the previous decade.

The ongoing pandemic is testing the concept of European solidarity. Earlier this month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called it the biggest test the EU has ever faced.

Many national health systems in the European Union have been stretched to the brink of collapse by the coronavirus, and the bloc’s economy could see one of its sharpest declines in history. London-based research firm Capital Economics said the disease could result in a record-breaking 15 percent quarterly drop of eurozone gross domestic product in the second quarter — the previous record was 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009.

This has led to questions about the EU’s future. While the full extent of the fallout remains to be seen, many observers and experts are worried that the pandemic could upend more than seven decades of European integration.

“Everybody is very much focused on the national situation,” Stefan Lehne, a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Europe think tank, told me. “This doesn’t mean that the EU will be at an end, but it might end up weaker.”

A widening of the EU’s north-south divide could lead to a new financial crisis on the continent

The European Central Bank (ECB) reportedly warned eurozone finance ministers earlier this month that financial stimulus measures of up to €1.5 trillion ($1.6 trillion) may be required to counter the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. The ECB further estimated that the bloc’s economy could contract by 10 percent this year. Those dire predictions came after the ECB launched a temporary $750 billion debt-buying program in March to keep borrowing costs low.

This isn’t the first time the European Union has dealt with a financial crisis. The eurozone crisis, which was in part caused by the 2008 financial collapse, resulted in years of austerity for many southern European countries, including Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and caused a serious rift between the continent’s fiscally more conservative northern nations and their southern counterparts.

Even though the eurozone crisis and the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic are very different, it’s once again Europe’s southern countries that are bearing the brunt of it. Italy and Spain have not only endured some of the highest infection numbers in the world, they’ve also suffered some of the highest death tolls, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Furthermore, closed borders, travel restrictions, and the shutting down of bars and restaurants throughout most of Europe will be more severely felt across its southern countries, where tourism accounts for a higher share of the countries’ gross domestic product.

With countries like Italy and Greece still recovering from the lingering effects of the eurozone crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is taking another heavy toll on their domestic economies. This could not only widen the economic disparity between Europe’s northern and southern countries, but, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, could lead to a new eurozone crisis, Lehne warned.

“This would turn the EU into some kind of a transfer union, where the countries in the North would have to permanently fund those in the South, which some believe are not fiscally responsible,” he said. “I think this is the most important dividing line at the moment.”

To avoid a further deepening of this divide, the EU has to reach a compromise that doesn’t unfairly target any members

Knowing that solidarity among EU members is key to the alliance’s survival, Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz advocated for swift and united actions to combat the crisis.

“We need a clear expression of European solidarity in the corona pandemic,” they wrote in an article that was published on April 6 in newspapers in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece. “What we need is quick and targeted relief.”

The Eurogroup, which includes the 19 finance ministers of all eurozone countries, agreed on a €540 billion ($590 billion) rescue deal on April 9 to help the bloc’s coronavirus-stricken economies.

The deal includes €240 billion ($261 billion) made available through the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a bailout fund that was created during the eurozone crisis. Countries will be able to access up to 2 percent of their respective gross domestic product until the Covid-19 crisis is over, the Eurogroup said in a press release.

“We need a clear expression of European solidarity in the corona pandemic.”

The deal was only made possible after the Netherlands softened its demand that economic reform and external, independent oversight be tied to financial aid. There are no conditions attached to the ESM loans as long as the money is spent directly or indirectly on Covid-19 measures.

Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra described the agreement as “reasonable,” but reiterated his country’s opposition to so-called “eurobonds” or “coronabonds” — jointly-issued debt that’s being considered as a financial instrument to respond to the pandemic. France, Italy, Spain, and six other EU countries would prefer these as it would show solidarity among the EU nations and keep the worst-affected countries from being drowned by new debt.

Using the ESM option, on the other hand, means that countries like Italy will add to their debt burden. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday criticized it, calling cheap loans from the EU’s bailout fund a “totally inadequate tool.” He also said that Italy had no intention of applying for such a loan.

Yet German politician Jürgen Hardt expects Italy will take advantage of the ESM, despite Conte’s initial rejection. “I think it was maybe an emotional decision not to use the 39 billion euros reserved for Italy,” he told me.

Europe’s southern nations “are the ones that need to borrow most, but they’re in the worst position to do so,” Simon Tilford, director of research and management at economics think tank New Forum, told me. “That’s why people are worried about whether this crisis can lead to a break in the eurozone or even member states being forced out.”

Hardt, who is a member of Chancellor Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Party, agreed that this crisis is threatening the European idea. He said that Germany, the Netherlands and others with economic and financial power need to step up and do for Europe what the US did after World War II.

“Germany benefited very much from the European recovery program (also known as the Marshall Plan), which was financed mainly by the US and helped us back on our feet after the Second World War,” he said. “I think we need something like that now from the economically stronger European countries. It would be a strong signal to those countries who doubt the EU right now.”

EU leaders are expected to hold a teleconference on April 23 to sign off on the finance ministers’ recommendations. Last month, they failed to reach an agreement on the best economic response to the pandemic, leading French President Emmanuel Macron to issue a warning: “What’s at stake is the survival of the European project,” he said.

"['Sean Collins', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-19,"What we know about a mass shooting in Nova Scotia, Canada","A shooter killed at least 18 people across Nova Scotia, Canada, police said Monday.

The suspect, a 51-year-old man, died shortly after being apprehended in Enfield, Nova Scotia, a town about 20 miles north of Halifax. Police believe he was responsible for a series of shootings that began in Portapique — a small town about 60 miles north of Halifax — around 10:30 pm local time Saturday night. As of Monday, officials said they were conducting investigations at 16 sites across Nova Scotia.

For at least a few hours on Sunday morning, the suspect was disguised as a police officer. Officials aren’t yet sure of his motive, but Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said Sunday the fact that “this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act.”

The suspect was ultimately apprehended at an Enfield gas station Sunday morning, after having switched vehicles. He was killed about 12 hours after police in Portapique first received a complaint about “a person with firearms” Saturday night.

Mass shootings are rare in Canada, particularly compared with the United States, in large part because stringent gun laws were enacted after a 1989 shooting that left 14 people dead. Now, any Canadian wishing to own a gun must register the firearm and undergo training, a risk assessment, and a background check. It’s not yet clear whether the suspect’s weapon was registered.

Monday, politicians faced a number of questions about new gun control legislation. In response, Canadian Minister of Public Safety Bill Blair promised that Parliament will bring forward new gun control legislation “as quickly as possible” once it returns from a coronavirus-related recess.

The story is still developing. Here’s what we know, and don’t know, so far.

"['Jen Kirby', 'Apr']",2020-04-19,"How to fix the WHO, according to an expert","Share All sharing options for: How to fix the WHO, according to an expert

“The W.H.O. really blew it,” President Donald Trump tweeted on April 7, referring to the World Health Organization. “For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look.”

Trump’s tweet, coincidentally, came on World Health Day, which honors health care workers around the world and celebrates the 1948 founding of the World Health Organization. The global health institution was created in a post-World War II world, based on the belief the planet had to work together to fight diseases and promote the health of all citizens.

And when a pandemic like the coronavirus happens, it’s obvious why the world needs an institution to help coordinate resources and distribute information.

But the WHO has come under pressure for its handling of the coronavirus, including whether it was too slow to declare a global health emergency and too generous in its praise of China for its handling of the outbreak.

Whether or how the WHO misstepped is up for debate. But President Trump, at least, has decided that the WHO failed to do enough, and this week announced his intention to halt funding for the agency.

The WHO is made up of member states, meaning it is only as effective as the countries that make up that body, and that definitely includes superpowers like the United States. As Kelley Lee, research chair in global health governance at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, told me, you can’t blame the WHO if you don’t empower it to begin with.

“To say, ‘WHO should do this, WHO should do that.’ Well, WHO is the member states,” Lee said. “So if you want WHO to do something, then the member states have to get together and say: ‘Do this.’”

Lee studied WHO reform efforts in the 1990s, published a book on the organization, co-established the WHO Collaborating Centre on Global Change and Health, and has chaired the WHO Resource Group on Globalization, Trade and Health.

I spoke to her to get a better understanding of the WHO’s mission, why the WHO is facing criticism, how the organization got to this point — and, whether and how the World Health Organization’s shortcomings can be fixed before the next pandemic hits.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Jen Kirby

This is a very basic question, but what exactly is the World Health Organization?

Kelley Lee

In a nutshell, it’s the United Nations’s specialized agency for health. So the WHO is the coordinating body for international cooperation in the health sphere.

It was created in 1948, after the Second World War. It had predecessors; it was formed by bringing together some of the regional bodies that existed. There was a League of Nations organization for health that didn’t go anywhere because the United States didn’t join, so they tried to make it more open and more member-state-oriented.

Jen Kirby

And what is the WHO’s role — or should be its role?

Kelley Lee

It was created to balance those needs at the time, which were post-war outbreaks and trying to respond to humanitarian needs. Over time, it’s evolved in different ways into an organization that provides both what they call “normative functions” — providing guidelines and technical advice, collecting data, statistics, and so on. And then, I think increasingly member states wanted it to take a more active role in advocating for specific health issues. So it got involved in things like Health for All and all sorts of campaigns.

But essentially, if you look at the WHO’s constitution, it is a member-state organization. It doesn’t have independent authority to do what it likes. The World Health Assembly meets every year. And that is sort of the legislative body of WHO, and the secretariat carries out what is decided upon. It doesn’t mean [they don’t] have any powers, the secretariat and the director-general, but it really has to go through all the member states.

So the way I describe WHO is it’s the ultimate committee-designed organization. You know, when you try and do something by committee, it can end up a bit of a mess.

The other way I describe the WHO is like if you go into a restaurant, it’s got everything on the menu. It’s one of those Gordon Ramsay moments where, “You need to reduce this menu, you can’t do everything.” And I think WHO has been like that because it’s had to respond to 194 countries. So it has everything to do with health. And I don’t think that’s tenable for any organization, especially when you have frozen resources. And so you’re spread more and more thin, and you’re trying to do everything.

Jen Kirby

That’s the perfect overview, and this idea that it’s a restaurant with everything being on the menu is an interesting one. Is that because, after the WHO was founded in 1948, it just kept adding new priorities, and didn’t take anything off the menu? Why does it just have such a massive mandate?

Kelley Lee

It is a very cumbersome organization, lots of different parts, the way it’s structured, with headquarters and then regional offices and country offices. But I think it really reflects the starting point in the organization, its constitution. And if you look at the definition of health, it’s a very broad one. It’s not just the absence of disease, but it’s all of these things like well-being and so on. That interpretation, over time, has led to everything under the sun [being placed] under what health is.

In a way, it’s right. It’s that tension between a disease focus and a more clinical look at what health is, and broader, social determinants of health — the environment, education, and so on. So there’s always been that tension and almost philosophy about what health is, and what creates good health and well-being.

And you see this across the different countries even: the US versus some of the European countries. That’s all played out at WHO. WHO needs to accommodate all of these kind of philosophies about what health is and it’s responding to both high-income countries and low-income countries. Trying to be everything to everyone, and that’s what the constitution laid out.

So from the beginning, I think its design was almost impossible to fulfill, unless you had the right resources. Priority setting has always been a problem, and it’s been an ongoing effort to reform the organization to be better at priority setting; when everything’s a priority, nothing’s a priority.

I’ve been in so many reform meetings where, it’s like, “What do we cut? Mental health? Or do we cut road traffic accidents?” Everything is important. It’s a Sophie’s Choice situation where, “Which child do you give away?”

Obviously when there’s an outbreak like this, of course, this is everybody’s immediate priority. But these other issues are not less important, just because they’re chronic or long-term. So how does the organization choose where to put its limited resources? And that’s been a real struggle.

Jen Kirby

With so many priorities, was the WHO caught in a similar situation where it had so many priorities, that it also wasn’t really prepared or had the resources to deal with a pandemic?

Kelley Lee

So, WHO doesn’t have any resources to be the action on the ground. It’s always been very much an advisory body, recommending what a country should do. It doesn’t have the UNICEF [United Nations Children’s Fund] mode of operation where it can go in and vaccinate children, for example.

WHO has never done that, that’s not what its role is supposed to be, to get into countries and be boots on the ground. And people probably wanted that to happen. “Oh, why isn’t WHO sending in people into Wuhan?” That was never its role. Its role was to do intelligence-gathering, and then alert countries, and countries are the ones that act. So there’s that.

The other thing is, to say, “WHO should do this, WHO should do that.” Well, WHO is the member states. So if you want WHO to do something, then the member-states have to get together and say, “Do this.”

And that is the other problem. Countries are very divided about what WHO should do. So there’s a lot of difference of opinion. Some people say some countries get their way more than others. So there’s this kind of [debate] being played out: What is it that WHO should do? Countries are not agreeing, so then WHO ends up doing everything.

Jen Kirby

So it sounds like part of the problem is not just WHO’s mandate, but the dynamic of member states, which is a reflection of how the world operates. I imagine member states who have more leverage on the international stage, or who give more funds, have a lot to do with shaping that agenda. Given the current debate, I’m specifically thinking of the United States, or China.

Kelley Lee

It’s ironic that the US is accusing WHO of being China-centric, when actually for decades, it’s been accused of being very US-centric, if anything. So it’s kind of interesting how it’s playing out, for sure.

The organization likes to be seen as scientific and medical, and that it’s trying to keep politics out. What I’ve written in the past is that it’s inherently political. But the thing is, you want to have good politics, you want to have all countries being able to express their views. Yes, we all have different interests. But have a fair process, allocating resources or priorities accordingly, not having one or certain parties dominate.

When you have bad politics, when there’s unfairness and there’s a lack of transparency and accountability, that’s when problems happen. It’s not like we can take politics out of WHO. But what we want to do is take bad politics out of WHO. And that’s the challenge.

And for an organization where the funding is so skewed toward voluntary contributions, this is the problem. “Whoever pays the piper, plays the tune” type thing. You have all these vested interests buying, basically, what WHO does. It’s a very difficult situation.

Jen Kirby

But I imagine this difficult situation has not happened in a year, or two. Can you point to a period in time when these politics really began to interfere in WHO’s mandate, and put it in the position it is today?

Definitely, we have to take a historical perspective. So this has been unfolding over decades. The turning point was probably the late 1970s, when there was a historical movement for low- and middle-income countries, the New International Economic Order movement. And they tried to challenge the world economy and how the United Nations system worked. There were a lot of accusations at that time that the UN system was becoming politicized, and organizations like WHO were starting to recognize that it needed to address the developing world’s needs more effectively with the health for all movement and then the essential drugs list. And then there were the breast milk substitutes guidelines that were adopted.

Those all upset certain interests, largely the US and big companies, which didn’t like WHO to stray beyond disease-control programs: things like smallpox eradication, which was uncontroversial. But the US thought that this was straying into territories where WHO shouldn’t be, asking for regulation of the industry, whether it’s food or pharma or so on.

So the US and some other countries — which were shifting to the right at that point under leaders like US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher — they started to freeze WHO’s budget on the assessed contribution side. And so you see the voluntary contributions growing from that point. This is where WHO didn’t have a choice, it had to take more voluntary contributions.

By the 1990s, which is when I come onto the scene and start to analyze this with my colleagues, we did this big study in the mid-90s about financing the WHO and it was about 50-50 at that time, between assessed and voluntary contributions. And that, in itself, was alarming. We said that had to stop. We had to make sure the WHO could set the priorities, not all of these countries and donors, and that’s actually gotten worse.

I think it’s now up to 80 to 85 percent voluntary, and it just continued. So you could see this upward trend. Also, other organizations were created at the time; the Global Fund. Gates came onto the scene, and so there’s been donors putting their money elsewhere, away from WHO.

And WHO said, “We need to be the coordinating body. There’s too many other players out there.” It became a very fragmented, uncoordinated space for action. So we have this crazy, market-driven global health environment, where donors put their money where they want, and create other competing initiatives.

It’s [been] a long time happening, and so what we’re seeing now is, we want the WHO to coordinate, but we haven’t made it the coordinating body for decades. So, it’s very difficult to then step in and get everybody to work together.

It sounds like this distrust has been building for some time with the WHO, which would make it harder for the WHO to inspire cooperation and marshal resources to fight a pandemic. How much does this distrust play into why the WHO is floundering a bit — or at least is perceived to be by some?

Kelley Lee

WHO has its faults, but I hesitate to say, WHO hasn’t done this, it hasn’t done that. It’s really been like a ship in the stormy seas — with all the changes politically going on, it’s been just buffeted about.

It’s tried to cling onto the fact that it is a scientific organization. They’ve got to wise up. Clinging to this myth that somehow health is not political, it’s actually a losing game.

And if we got rid of WHO now, what do we have instead?

We’d have to rebuild WHO or some global health organization. And the question now is, what would that look like? How would that not be designed by committee, or who would be in charge? Who would have the authority? What would you want it to do?

Then, the politics start again. I’m finding it really a little bit worrying that we come out of this outbreak and we destroy WHO, and we have nothing for the next time. There’s going to be a next time. This is just a warmup.

I’m very concerned that we don’t destroy what little we already have. Instead, go the other way, let’s see what we can do to build up WHO and make it the organization we need it to be.

Jen Kirby

It might be tough to rebuild the WHO in the middle of the pandemic. But how can WHO be fixed?

Kelley Lee

This is something I’ve been teaching all term actually, so it’s great that you asked that. I give my students this slide, which has four pictures on it. The first one is an old computer that basically doesn’t work anymore, and you just need to replace it. That’s retiring WHO: in this case, it can’t be fixed, you’ve got to throw it away. That’s, I guess, what President Trump wants to do.

The second one is to keep putting in new peripherals, so you’re plugging in the old extra hard drives. WHO gets all these new programs plugged into an old laptop, and eventually, it can’t run all these things. It’s overwhelmed. That, to me, doesn’t work because you have just too much demand on an old infrastructure.

The third option is to look at what we have, which is a lot of different players out there, and create some sort of network. Somebody has to be in the middle to coordinate, and we have to then strengthen that middle. But to see what other organizations do best, what’s their functions, what are their spheres of expertise — and there are big gaps — so we’d have to create new organizations that do that, but a network model.

And then the other is, if you could imagine an iPad, for example, it’s an innovative idea. Integrate it all into a new product. This picture of the iPad really helped because it’s about creating a new organization where it’s not networked, everything is under one roof, but you think of something very, very different from what the postwar period had.

The postwar period was very much about states, and we still are going to live in a system of individual states that’s not going away. But states alone are not the only important source of authority. So creating something that shares authority in the world and recognizes that the world is changing.

It’s very interconnected. It’s a kind of Star Trek model: we all think of this wonderful world where the world comes together and you have this different governance system. I suspect we’re somewhere in between. We’re still trying to figure out which is the best model to reform global health governance.

Jen Kirby

What might be a model for a new WHO?

Kelley Lee

I would say that one of the things that WHO could benefit from — and people are thinking about this — is think about what the world values. We created institutions, gave them power, according to what we value. Over the last 20 years, you’ve seen, we’ve created the World Trade Organization because countries recognize that trade benefits, at least the powerful countries. And probably most countries now want trade to happen in an organized, legal framework.

So WTO was created, and then we have various treaties that countries abide by. If they don’t abide by them, there are sanctions. There are countermeasures that WTO has the power to enforce. If you treat somebody unfairly, your country can go to WTO, make a complaint, if they win, you have either these extra tariffs, or you might not be able to export your goods. There are these countermeasures.

Now, we’re coming out of a pandemic. I think we all value health. We’re recognizing, “Yeah, we’ve ignored this, but health is really important because the world can’t function like this.” This is just insane, is what we’ve realized. We will all shut down if we don’t have a good global health security system.

So what powers do we need to give to this new organization — or reformed organization — to ensure that every country doesn’t go through this again? That means giving up some power at the state level, like the WTO, which has some supranational authority. What do we need to give WHO or something like it to enforce its requirements, and we all benefit from it?

This is what the debate is. What are we willing to give up to get security back? Some are more willing than others. Some countries don’t want to give up anything. Others are like, “Yes, we would want to buy into this.”

But nobody’s escaping from this. We all suffer because we are all interconnected as a global economy. I think even the private companies would get on board with this. They see they can’t operate in a world where there’s no global health security.

Jen Kirby

But this sounds like it can only exist in a perfect world — and maybe, in a post-pandemic society, things will be different, and people will reevaluate priorities. But I think even the example of the WTO shows the problems with this type of model: we had a global trade war, and the US has bucked its authority, refusing to appoint judges, which renders it ineffective. Basically, it just sounds very idealistic.

Kelley Lee

And that’s why I say, it’s called a Star Trek kind of scenario. We’re just not there yet. I think it’s going to be an incremental path, and we’re not going to jump to something where we have a universal government.

What we do need to do is think about what do we value in this world? What keeps us all working and moving around the world? What’s the infrastructure we need, and all of us have an interest in buying into?

The global health security system has been underfunded, ignored, despite repeated warnings that we need this. Just like we haven’t invested enough in public health systems nationally, we haven’t done that globally.

And I think it’s going to be a combination of carrots and sticks, to be honest. It’s not just going to be a WHO with enforcement powers to punish. I think we have to create incentives, as well. Whether it’s financial assistance, technical support, public shaming, I don’t know. Just a real range of things.

But certainly, there’s no use accusing WHO of not doing enough. There’s no teeth. The organization has no teeth. It’s just pointless.

Jen Kirby

It’s a balance that seems hard to strike.

Kelley Lee

This is what we’re all thinking about. What is it going to look like? How would you do that? You’d need legal expertise, and what international law would offer. You need diplomatic expertise, what could we negotiate?

Russia is not going to just exactly jump on board, or China, or the US, either. These three countries, who are protecting their sovereignty fiercely, are not going to want the rest of the world to tell them what to do.

But there are other countries who are more willing and might go ahead of these three countries. It’s not going to be all or nothing. I think we’re going to have to get like-minded countries together. I think Canada will be one of them, to move and to have a multilateral approach.

Jen Kirby

It feels a bit as if the coronavirus pandemic has put the world at a crossroads. Countries could turn even more inward, or, more hopefully, they might start looking outward and revive global cooperation. It sort of seems like there’s two ways to go right now.

Kelley Lee

That’s how I read it as well. There’s a real tension, and I don’t know which way it’s going to go. I’m concerned, and I give these interviews because I want people to go the international route. I really feel that that is the way forward.

But you’re right. Some countries may decide that, no, we’re going to retreat into our castles. It’s kind of a medieval analogy. And obviously that didn’t work when the black plague came along.

Jen Kirby

Essentially, we’ll learn all the wrong lessons from this pandemic.

Kelley Lee

You can’t hide from these kinds of outbreaks. This is the thing. People thinking that they can somehow quarantine themselves from these risks is really a dream. So, countries might say, “Okay, we’re going to retreat from globalization. We’re just going to disconnect and become national economies.” And that, of course, is not going to happen.

The global economy has moved so much. We are interconnected. We can’t dial it back. But we have to recognize that we need to invest, as much as we’ve invested in markets, we need investing in strong government and strong multilateral capacity.

So, we are definitely at a crossroads. We’re also at a point in history, I think, where the world has never been as interconnected as it is now. And so the institutions that we built after the Second World War are really out of date.

I talked to my students about being obsolete, like the Maginot line during the Second World War, when the French thought they could stop Germany from invading and built these fortifications.

Now we’re having that same Maginot line moment. We need to think more forward-looking. Does humanity have this in our brains to design something very different? We certainly did after the Second World War. There was nothing like the United Nations. There was the League of Nations, which didn’t really work. So they designed the UN system. It wasn’t perfect, but it got us through a period of crisis. It generally was a good thing that it was created.

Now, we’re at that historic moment. Do we need another global conference? I think we need leadership. Whatever countries are doing well, it’s because they have good leadership. This is such a test.

Jen Kirby

You mentioned the WTO, but are there any other models or proposals — even on a smaller scale — that could be a good model for this new, iPad version of the WHO?

Kelley Lee

I wish I did. And if I did, I’d probably be very famous. I think there are parts of different organizations that might be kind of ideas. Like the International Labor Organization brings in non-state actors and state actors within its decision-making body.

I think we do need to think beyond states. I don’t mean by bringing in just big companies. I mean civil society. We have to see, okay, “how do we politically organize our world and who has authority?”

There have been ideas put forward over the last few years about how to adapt WHO. But what I think what will happen is that some countries will get together and plug the financial hole for WHO, and it’ll just continue to lumber on.

But we need to think, after the pandemic, about, hopefully, a different model.

"['Zeeshan Aleem', 'Alex Ward', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-19,South Korea has brought its reported spread of coronavirus infections to single digits per day,"South Korea’s public health agency, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Sunday that the country reported just eight new cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, the lowest new case number since the country experienced an explosive outbreak two months ago.

The South Korean government said it will extend its social distancing policies until May 5 to prevent a new surge in cases, but that as a result of declining cases, it will also relax some of its restrictions as risk has become more manageable.

In March the government recommended that indoor sports, religious and entertainment facilities suspend operations. Reuters reports that language has been relaxed now, “allowing facilities to restart operations as long as they comply with disinfection guidelines.” In addition, the Korea Baseball Organization will be able to hold games again — albeit without an audience — and churches will also face fewer restrictions.

“It is safest to maintain the intensive social distancing, but it isn’t easy realistically. We need to find a middle ground,” South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said at a televised meeting of government officials.

The reduction of new cases in South Korea is a striking achievement for a country that earlier this year had the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia outside China. On February 20, confirmed infections skyrocketed exponentially after a parishioner of a megachurch in the southern city of Daegu infected other congregants during services, but the government’s aggressive testing and contact-tracing regime seems to have played a significant role in counteracting this rapid spike in cases quickly.

Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the country’s CDC, expressed caution about interpreting the numbers as a sign that the worst was over, however.

“We remain nervous as we could be missing some infection cases and those with no or few symptoms could come in close contact with others, for a possible spike in new cases later,” she said at a news briefing.

Minister of Health and Welfare Park Neung-hoo has told the press that the government expects to reassess risk every two weeks and to revise social distancing guidelines in accordance with those assessments.

President Moon Jae-in, who was recently reelected in one of the first national elections globally since the pandemic began, said South Korea’s example should give hope to the world that the pandemic is “surmountable.”

“The government will prepare for new daily lives and the new world order ‘post-Covid’ with the unified power of the citizens,” he said.

South Korea has been approaching coronavirus differently than many countries

South Korea’s rapid reduction of its new infection rate has caught the eye of governments and public health officials around the world.

Experts say there are a number of measures it’s taken to achieve its results, including building a highly organized and massive testing capacity, and the government institution of tracing and isolation measures for people who have been in contact with the infected.

Notably, South Korea has generally avoided the wide-scale shutdowns that China and the US have pursued, according to Business Insider. It has shut down schools and imposed a curfew in some cities, but the government has sought primarily, in a highly targeted fashion, to isolate groups of people who are suspected to have been exposed.

The New York Times’ Max Fisher and Choe Sang-Hun wrote a thorough explainer in late March about what makes the South Korean model effective. Among other things, they highlight the fact that the government organized mass production of coronavirus test kits earlier than many other hard-hit countries, which meant that in late March the country had a per-capita test rate “more than 40 times that of the United States.”

They also point to an astonishingly extensive surveillance and contact-tracing infrastructure:

South Koreans’ cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. Websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people’s travel — which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks. People who believe they may have crossed paths with a patient are urged to report to testing centers. South Koreans have broadly accepted the loss of privacy as a necessary trade-off. People ordered into self-quarantine must download another app, which alerts officials if a patient ventures out of isolation. Fines for violations can reach $2,500.

The government has also taken measures to try to comfort people in the chaos by doing things like sending comfort packages with food and cleaning supplies to people who are under quarantine.

Approval of the government’s response to the pandemic was so widespread that the country saw its largest turnout in nearly three decades during national elections held last week, and the ruling party won reelection by a landslide.

South Korea’s management of the spread of the virus does not mean that it’s out of the woods. Places like Hong Kong and Singapore have seen resurgences of cases, in part due to people entering the country from abroad. But South Korea does seem to have some tools — and a plan — in place to manage the spread for now.

"['Jag Bhalla', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-17,This viral Angela Merkel clip explains the risks of loosening social distancing too fast,"When you have a huge hole where your nation’s leadership should be, it is wise to borrow the best of other people’s leaders. They can’t make America’s big decisions, but they can fill in some of the gaps.

In the Covid-19 pandemic, we can take comfort in their competence and use their wisdom to guide us about what we each should do.

Right now, the United States and many other nations are considering easing social distancing and other restrictions if and when their new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations become flat or start to fall. And German Chancellor Angela Merkel (who happens to have scientific chops) has an important lesson that we should all listen to.

On Wednesday, she laid out important logic about the coronavirus pandemic that hasn’t been communicated clearly enough here in the US. In simple and clear terms, she explains why Germany doesn’t have much “wiggle room” in its hospital capacity. Because of this, any lifting of its lockdown, like allowing some shops to open next week, will remain “on thin ice.”

Merkel’s explanation, which went viral, is centered on the metric called R0, or basic reproduction number. It represents the number of people a sick person will infect on average in a group that’s susceptible to the disease (meaning they don’t already have immunity).

She says that if Germany’s R0 were to shift from a flat rate of 1.0 to 1.1, the nation’s hospitals would be crushed by October, without sufficient resources to care for all of the severely ill Covid-19 patients. If the R0 goes up to 1.2, that overload hits in July. And so on.

Related Why France has 4 times as many coronavirus deaths as Germany

Covid’s current global average R0 is 2-2.5, but Germany has done a good enough job of managing its outbreak to get its reported estimated R0 down to 0.7 as of April 17. That’s low enough for Merkel to sanction “a tentative easing of restriction.”

Germany is not out of the woods, however. Marieke Degen, the deputy spokesperson of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, told Vox’s Alex Ward that it’s “very important to stress that Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic” and that more and more elderly people in the country are getting sick.

America, for many reasons, has even less wiggle room than Germany. Germany has eight hospital beds per capita compared to America’s 2.7 beds. In ICU beds, Germany has 8.3 per capita while America has 6.6.

It is also testing for coronavirus at twice the US rate (21 vs 9.8 tests per 1,000 people). Without robust testing, you can’t keep good tabs on R0 or the related Rt — and you can end up flying blind, risking health system overload and avoidable deaths.

Covid-19 spreads in an exponential way, and it’s worth emphasizing exponential growth’s dynamics. Tiny shifts in risk grow very quickly, leading to deadly results, as this useful tweet thread shows:

Exponentials still have the capacity to shock me.



If mass wearing of masks make just 0.01 shift in the spread per day, from say 1.22x to 1.21x, there would now be ~20% fewer cases (and ~20% fewer deaths) in the UK since March 12.

The small choices we each make about risky behaviors are like playing Russian roulette, but with a machine gun. You may have thought that if you’re not in a high-risk group (like older adults), and the case fatality rate is around 1 percent, then the threat isn’t so great. Surely we can loosen restrictions?

But that’s like being locked in a room with 100 people, where your collective behavior determines how many bullets are live in the machine gun that’s about to strafe all of you. You might not die, but others surely will.

Covid-19 is already the leading cause of death in many areas, including New York state, Louisiana, and Washington, DC. Do you want to add ammunition to its arsenal?

"['Jen Kirby', 'Apr']",2020-04-17,What we can learn from the “second wave” of coronavirus cases in Asia,"Share All sharing options for: What we can learn from the “second wave” of coronavirus cases in Asia

Right now, if you fly to Hong Kong, you’ll have to turn over your saliva. That is, if you’re already a resident. If not, you can’t come in at all.

The saliva, of course, is for a coronavirus test, one of the measures the Hong Kong government has adopted — including banning non-residents from entry, and giving tracking bracelets tied to an app to those arrivals who are allowed in — to try to control a small wave of new coronavirus cases that arose in recent weeks.

Hong Kong isn’t the only place in Asia that did a good job controlling its initial coronavirus outbreak only to see a resurgence of coronavirus cases. Singapore and Taiwan were both seen as examples of how to handle the coronavirus outbreak: stanching the growth of infections, while largely keeping their economies open.

Instead of widespread lockdowns, these places relied on tools such as robust testing, contact tracing to identify people who came in contact with infected people and may have been exposed to the virus, mass surveillance, isolation of the ill, and stringent travel restrictions. It wasn’t exactly life as normal, but it wasn’t a total shutdown, either.

This has changed, to varying degrees, as the threat of new cases rises both within these places’ borders, and without.

Hong Kong had to adopt more stringent social distancing measures at the end of March, including strengthening travel rules and closing bars. Singapore avoided mass closures at first, but has now imposed lockdown measures until May 4 and temporarily closed schools. Taiwan hasn’t shut down, but it has put really stringent travel restrictions in place.

And this may be the world’s new normal, at least until an effective medical therapy is widely available that lessens the intensity of the disease, or the world acquires immunity, most likely through a vaccine. Social distancing measures may be a recurring tool — intensifying, easing, and intensifying again as outbreaks surge, diminish, and surge again.

Because as long as the coronavirus is spreading somewhere, it can spread everywhere. That is why no country has beaten the coronavirus yet.

“We will not get rid of the disease until every country has a system to detect the disease and stop it near the origin, as or as close to the origin as possible, before it spreads,” Olga Jonas, a senior fellow at the Harvard Global Health Institute who formerly helped to coordinate the World Bank’s response to avian and pandemic flu threats, told me.

“The weak links have to be addressed in every country,” she added.

Why Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore saw another coronavirus wave — and will likely see more

Hong Kong’s bump in coronavirus infections, beginning in March, was relatively small, and largely attributed to people returning to the territory from places overseas where the coronavirus was then spreading rapidly, such as the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States.

That created tensions in the territory, as residents blamed returning expats for the spread. Authorities also identified small clusters of local transmissions, including at Lan Kwai Fong, a district in Hong Kong with a lot of bars that’s popular for its nightlife.

In response to the new rise in cases, Hong Kong on March 25 fully closed its borders to non-residents for a two-week period, allowing exceptions for visitors from mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan as long as they hadn’t traveled anywhere else in the 14 days prior.

Schools had already been closed in Hong Kong until at least April 20, but Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam added new measures at the end of March, including a ban on gatherings of four or more people and the closure of arcades, gyms, and movie theaters. Restaurants had to limit the number of people allowed inside, take the temperatures of everyone entering their establishments, and provide hand sanitizer to patrons.

In April, all bars and pubs were also ordered to close, followed on April 10 by beauty and massage parlors. All of these orders will be in effect until at least April 23. Hong Kong’s government also extended travel restrictions indefinitely and ordered that, starting April 8, all travelers arriving to Hong Kong, symptomatic or not, would need to undergo a coronavirus test and then enter a 14-day quarantine.

As of April 17, Hong Kong has just over 1,000 coronavirus cases (up from 400 when the new restrictions began in late March), with just single-digit increases by the day. At least one Hong Kong lawmaker has said it may be time to loosen some restrictions again.

Taiwan, too, attributed its spike to imported cases, warning Taiwanese people to avoid traveling outside the island and risk bringing the disease back. On March 19, Taiwan barred all foreign nationals (with some exceptions, including for diplomats) from entering the island. The government also barred any travelers from transiting through Taiwan, and required any returnees to quarantine for 14 days.

As of April 14, Taiwan had nearly 400 total cases, 338 of which came from outside the island. Though it recently had no new cases for the first time in more than a month, Taiwan is not letting up travel restrictions until the pandemic is under control elsewhere.

“Of course, we hope it has passed,” Taiwan’s Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said at a press conference this week, according to Reuters. “But we still need to be on our guard. Of course we feel happy at no new cases today.”

Singapore also dealt with a wave of imported cases. Now, though, the city-state’s latest rise in cases is being attributed to migrant workers, who are often crowded together in dormitories. Singapore has taken strict measures to sequester these workers, including by putting four facilities, containing some 50,000 people, under quarantine. The government is also housing healthy workers who work in essential services in separate facilities, so they can continue to work.

Singapore also instituted in early April what it called a “circuit breaker” — basically a partial lockdown by a much nicer name. Singapore hadn’t needed to do that before, but as it saw cases surge past 1,000, it embraced more stringent measures. Now, people can only go outside for essential services, to visit the doctor, or do solo exercise, and are required to keep their distance. Restaurants are allowed to stay open for takeout or delivery only. Schools are closed. These measures will be in place until May 4.

Singapore has over 5,900 total confirmed cases as of April 18; infections jumped more than 1,000 in just three days this week, a sign that the country does not yet have infections under control again. As some critics have pointed out, Singapore’s treatment of migrants, and reluctance to let them put real roots down there, likely helped create this crisis that threatens the rest of the city-state, too.

“Suppression and lift” might become the new normal. That is, if the world can get there.

Gabriel Leung, an infectious disease epidemiologist and dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, described Hong Kong’s strategy as “suppression and lift” in a New York Times op-ed on April 6.

“[T]o see us through the next year or more, we must all prepare for several cycles of a ‘suppress and lift’ policy — cycles during which restrictions are applied and relaxed, applied again and relaxed again, in ways that can keep the pandemic under control but at an acceptable economic and social cost,” Leung wrote.

Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan are essentially following this course to varying degrees. They’re using testing, contact tracing, travel restrictions, and social distancing measures as something like a brake, in Leung’s words, to be applied when infections begin to surge, and then loosened up as it comes under control again. It requires constant reaction, adaption, flexibility.

“The bottom-line is that responding appropriately to the epidemic situation is a dynamic process requiring adjustments — loosening and tightening — as is appropriate,” Keiji Fukuda, director and clinical professor of the public health department at the University of Hong Kong, told me in an email.

“While recognizing we are all hoping to get back to normal as soon as possible, realistically, the optimal approach for countries and places will be to apply a dynamic process of monitoring and adjustment until vaccine becomes widely available,” he told me.

But those social distancing measures can be targeted much more effectively if the government has a better idea where the outbreaks are occurring.

“The take-away for me is that it has to involve case-based interventions,” Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said, of any effective strategy to control coronavirus. “Case identification, case isolation, contact investigation, and monitoring of contacts. Repeat.”

Nuzzo added that not every country has to do all the measures, “but every country that has been successful has had aggressive case-based interventions.”

Of course, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan have advantages that a lot of other places don’t have. They are relatively small — Hong Kong and Singapore each have populations slightly smaller than New York City; Taiwan has the largest population of the three, at about 23 million. Geography helps, too; Taiwan and Singapore are small islands, so it’s easier to control who’s coming across their borders than it is for the United States and Europe.

“Advantages are certainly on geography, wealth, medical facilities and a relatively compliant population that follows the rules,” Ramanan Laxminarayan, director and senior research scholar at the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy at Princeton University, wrote in an email.

These places, especially Hong Kong and Taiwan, also learned a lot from past virus outbreaks. “Hong Kong has invested heavily in preparedness for emerging infections since SARS in 2004,” Ben Cowling, professor at the school of public health at the University of Hong Kong, told me in an email. “The population are incredibly well informed about public health and have voluntarily changed their behaviors to complement the social distancing policies implemented by the government.”

So does this mean some form of social distancing is inevitable until there is a vaccine, or an effective treatment to lessen the ferocity of the coronavirus? The answer, sadly, is maybe. As experts pointed out, no country has yet been able to totally stop the return of coronavirus.

“This is a reminder that this virus is not going to go away. You have to look at the experience of the last four months in Wuhan to realize that even the most extensive population-movement restrictions ever put in place for a public health issue in modern times has not ended virus transmission within China,” Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, told me.

Things like antibody tests will help people and governments know who was infected, and whether they have immunity to the disease, which might also help to open up countries. But social distancing — the lifting and easing — might still need to exist.

Because even if countries can successfully test and trace, these tools are much more effective if every country is doing them. As long as the pandemic is active and alive somewhere around the world, the risk of new cases emerging is everpresent.

“Epidemic or pandemic control in the world very much depends on the weak links,” Jonas, the scientist at Harvard, said. “The whole system is as good as its weakest links.”

"['Catherine Kim', 'Apr']",2020-04-17,I voted in South Korea’s elections. This is what democracy can look like in a pandemic.,"I voted in South Korea’s elections. This is what democracy can look like in a pandemic.

Share All sharing options for: I voted in South Korea’s elections. This is what democracy can look like in a pandemic.

SEONGNAM, South Korea — On April 15, millions of people across South Korea donned face masks, rubber gloves, and hand sanitizer to cast their votes in a nationwide election.

Poll workers wore face protection, masks, and medical gloves. Upon arrival at the polling station, voters’ temperatures were taken, and anyone showing signs of fever was taken to a more secluded area of the building to cast their ballots. Separate polling stations were set up outside of hospitals for people infected with Covid-19 to vote.

The strict health and safety measures South Korea’s government put in place for election day could serve as a blueprint for the rest of the world — including the United States — on how to safely hold an election amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In-person voting is a risky prospect right now, as public health experts warn that having large numbers of people gather in small, enclosed areas like polling places is one of the surest ways to spread the extremely contagious coronavirus.

This scenario played out in Wisconsin last week, when Republican lawmakers and the state’s conservative-controlled Supreme Court rejected the Democratic governor’s attempts to postpone the state’s scheduled elections or change voting rules to allow people to vote by mail.

The result was a political and public health nightmare: Wisconsin voters were forced to either stay home and forfeit their votes or violate the state’s stay-at-home measures and risk their health to cast their votes in person at their local polling places. Thousands chose the latter option.

With little time to prepare, poll workers scrambled to do whatever they could to minimize the risk of the virus spreading. Photos showed voters — many wearing masks, but some not — trying to maintain social distancing guidelines (remaining at least 6 feet apart) as best they could while standing in long lines waiting to vote, before being ushered into cramped schools, gyms, public libraries, and churches to cast their ballots.

The state’s public health officials have said it could be weeks before they know whether Wisconsin’s elections triggered a wider outbreak of the coronavirus, and some state party officials worry the chaos around the election has damaged its legitimacy in the eyes of many voters.

But as South Korea’s very different experience on Wednesday shows, things didn’t have to go that way.

South Korean voters had to go through extensive sanitization measures

As of election day, April 15, South Korea had nearly 10,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 220 deaths. The country saw its peak of Covid-19 cases on February 29, when it recorded more than 900 new cases. Now, a month and a half later, the number of new cases lingers at around 30 a day — one of the quickest turnarounds for any country struggling with the virus.

Experts credit the drastic drop in numbers to a proactive government that has pushed aggressive preventive measures and consistent testing. The government bet on these same methods to safely hold the first national election by a country during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Entering the polling station was an extensive process. My polling station in Pangyo, Seongnam, was a community center within my apartment complex. There was a line out the door when I arrived at 10 am, which is when voters usually swarm to the polls.

As soon as I walked through the entrance, I had to stop at a “sanitizing station” where four officials stood armed with a thermometer that took my temperature when hovered above my forehead, several bottles of hand sanitizer, and boxes of disposable gloves.

Once they checked I had a mask on (I had brought one from home), they took my temperature to ensure that I showed no fever; those who had a temperature above 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit) were escorted to a separate polling booth in a secluded area before being sent for virus testing. They then squeezed hand sanitizer into my palms and gave me gloves to cover my clean hands.

Officials had already marked the floors ahead of time with stickers spaced one meter (3.28 feet) apart to ensure that voters were safely distanced while standing in line. Most people adhered to the stickers, and when a few inched up to the people in front of them out of impatience, the head supervisor of the poll instantly shooed them back into place.

The only time I took off my mask was when an official compared my face with my photo ID, which was required in the South Korean elections, and the entire process only lasted about 10 seconds.

Once it was my turn, I walked into one of the four voting booths, lined up a few feet apart from the other voters, with two paper ballots in my hand. The stamp I used to mark my vote slipped a bit in my gloved hands, but the gloves were necessary since there weren’t sanitizer wipes available to wipe down any surfaces. The government said it would frequently sanitize polling stations, but the booth wasn’t disinfected before the next voter walked in after me.

Once I cast my ballot, I was ushered to a large pink trash bag taped to the wall, dedicated to the disposal of gloves. A poll worker pointed to the trash bag and then to my hands to indicate I needed to remove my gloves before leaving.

Despite the long line and multiple sanitization steps, I was in and out of the building in less than 10 minutes.

Separate polling booths were set up outside of hospitals for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms, and those in more severe conditions mailed in their ballots.

The largest group the government had to address was the nearly 60,000 people in quarantine; 22.8 percent of these people — a total of 13,642 — applied to vote and were given the option to leave their houses at 5:20 pm to arrive at their polling stations by 6 pm, after the rest of the population finished voting.

They had an hour to cast their ballots and return to their homes by 7 pm. The BBC reported that they then had to call the government to announce their return home; failure to do so could lead to a visit from the police.

It’s an efficient system, but it’s not foolproof. There are still some risk factors that make experts like Kim Woo-joo, a professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital, wary.

Kim said it all depends on the cooperation of the quarantined people. If they fail to follow the rules, it could easily lead to another outbreak.

Related Democrats should make voting reform a nonnegotiable baseline for the next stimulus bill

“I’m concerned that some people might finish voting before 7 pm and use their remaining time to wander, such as going shopping or visiting coffee shops,” he said. “They may think they’re harmless because they don’t seem sick, but we already know that asymptomatic people can transfer the virus.”

Ultimately, the success of this election won’t be tested until two weeks from now, once the incubation period of the virus is over. But if there isn’t a major surge in cases by then, the US could learn a few lessons on how to successfully hold elections, especially as November inches closer.

Most people seemed to feel comfortable voting because of the government’s effective response to the pandemic

The masks, hand sanitizer, and plastic gloves may have been an odd sight, but in many ways, election day felt like any other election: Families arrived in groups at polling stations, some brought their pets, and neighbors greeted each other at the entrance.

Kim Yu-jin, 36, who wheeled her child in a stroller as she voted with her husband, said she was happy with the way the elections were held.

“The government was perfectly prepared,” she said. “As a country, we’ve already been doing a good job at social distancing, and individuals have been proactively using masks and hand sanitizer. Everyone’s been trying to be as cautious as possible, which helped boost the government’s efforts to ensure a safe election.”

Bu Kyeong-hee, 48, said opening the polls as planned was not only the best way to ensure a smooth election but also the most logical step for a country that is slowly easing back into normal life. She added that other countries could learn from the aggressive measures taken by both the government and individuals to prevent infections and maintain social distancing while proceeding with crucial democratic events.

Hwang Sung-ha, 37, also thought it was appropriate for the government to push forward with the election because people could have a direct say in picking officials who would rebuild the country ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Not everyone agrees, though: While Lee Kyeong-sook, 67, also said she was impressed by how the government handled the election, she said she had initially hoped for the government to postpone the event.

“My friends and I all agreed that we wished the government had delayed the election,” she said. “They’ve already been asking people my age to stay inside, so I wonder why they pushed for us to show up at the polls today.”

But ultimately, Lee — who cast her ballot along with more than 29 million others around the country — said she did so because it’s her duty as a citizen. Voting is a right that Koreans obtained only in 1948, which is why she considers it so important to voice her opinion through elections.

“We need to come together for the best of our country — especially during times like this,” she said.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-09,Sweden’s government has tried a risky coronavirus strategy. It could backfire.,"As most governments around the world impose strict social distancing measures to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, Sweden has tried something quite different — and it’s unclear if it’ll prove successful or lead to more deaths.

For months, the Scandinavian nation allowed large gatherings to form, schools for younger children to remain open, restaurants to serve late-night guests, and resorts to welcome thrill-seeking skiers. Although some restrictions were in place and many people observed general safety and social distancing measures, Swedish health authorities felt it was better to have much of the country operating somewhat normally instead of shutting it all down.

On a theoretical scale of activity, where most countries brought it down to zero in the hope of quickly ramping up to 100 again, experts say Sweden has tried to keep the country at a simmer of 30 to manage the crisis for months to come.

“The reason given by Swedish authorities is about resilience,” Peter Lindgren, the managing director of the Swedish Institute for Health Economics, told me. “We may have to do this for a long time, and if you put all the heavy stuff in place at once, it will be quite difficult to maintain that. By having some measures in place and trying to be a bit more proportional, it’s possible to actually keep this under control.”

Sweden’s neighbors have taken a more aggressive approach during the Covid-19 outbreak. Denmark and Norway, for example, quickly closed their borders along with schools and industry to maximize social distancing. The chart below shows that those two countries have done better than Sweden in keeping the number of cases down.

There are sharp differences in COVD19 strategists between the Nordic countries. And also a distinct difference in results as measured in deaths. pic.twitter.com/Egw51K02Xk — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) April 16, 2020

But Swedish officials, and particularly chief state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, argue theirs is the right way forward. “Locking people up at home won’t work in the longer term. Sooner or later people are going to go out anyway,” Tegnell told reporters recently. He’s also repeatedly said it would be good for the Swedish population to gain immunity to the disease, though he’s flatly denied purposely seeking “herd immunity.”

Whatever the true goal, Sweden’s strategy appears to be troubled.

As of April 9, Sweden’s rate per capita of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus is higher than the rate of its fellow Scandinavian countries or the US. Hospitals are overcrowded and staff members are overworked, and the military has begun setting up field hospitals in major cities, including Stockholm, the country’s capital and the epicenter of its outbreak. The government is now seeking extraordinary powers to impose further restrictions.

Some experts I spoke to estimated that as many as 4 million Swedes — out of a population of around 10 million — may eventually contract the disease. And Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven stated this week that “thousands” in his country will die from Covid-19.

Experts note it’s still too early to tell if the Swedish government’s methods will prove successful in the end. But most Swedes I talked to said they’re unhappy being the world’s guinea pigs at such a dangerous time.

“I didn’t sign my informed consent for this experiment,” virologist Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér of the Karolinska Institute, a medical research center near Stockholm, told me. “I don’t know if [my family and I] can stay in a country that is not protecting its population.”

Many Swedes adopted social distancing. But not all of them.

As the outbreak started to hit Scandinavia, Norway restricted outdoor gatherings to no more than five people and encouraged those inside to keep 6 feet away from each other. Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to close its borders as it also shuttered schools and restaurants and limited outdoor groups to 10 or fewer.

Sweden’s government, by contrast, said it was okay for up to 500 people to meet outside. Schools for children 16 and younger would remain open, as would other establishments from restaurants to hair salons. And the government refused to close borders because, in Tegnell’s words last month, “We are not in the containment phase. We are in the mitigation phase,” because the virus had already hit the country.

The government was clear, though, that Swedes should adopt the usual social distancing measures to flatten the curve. And experts told me the population typically trusts what officials say and abides by their guidelines, allowing officials not to have to impose strict measures.

Top Swedish officials say that two-way trust is paying off. “It is a myth that life goes on as normal in Sweden. Many people stay at home and have stopped traveling,” Sweden’s Minister of Health and Social Affairs Lena Hallengren told me. “There is no full lockdown of Sweden, but many parts of the Swedish society have shut down.”

Hallengren offered some data points to make her case. Ridership on public transportation in Stockholm has dropped about 60 percent, she said. Nearly all domestic flights in Sweden have been canceled. All the major ski resorts in the country have closed voluntarily. And local media reports that 85 percent of people who’d planned to travel to Gotland, a popular Swedish vacation island, have canceled their trips ahead of Easter weekend.

Ludvig Beckman, a political scientist at Stockholm University, agreed with this general view. “A large majority are following the government’s advice,” he told me. “It’s pretty empty out there.”

Even critics of the government’s handling of the outbreak like Söderberg-Nauclér said that “it was a great thing from the beginning to trust people.” But, she noted, not everyone would reward Stockholm’s trust — and that’s where major problems have arisen.

Sweden’s lax coronavirus approach could put its people in danger

Knowing that events were capped at 500 people, organizers purposely sold 499 tickets to customers. Some older people, feeling little pressure from authorities, continued to go out into busy public squares. And bars, a central hangout spot for many young people in Stockholm, still served patrons deep into the night.

“Is it really that damn bad?” Sandra Bergkvist, a 28-year-old grocery clerk in Sweden, asked in an interview with the Washington Post this month while drinking beer with friends. “Of course we’re worried about people in the risk groups, but if it wasn’t for media it wouldn’t have been this hysterical.”

That nonchalance may have led to the country’s worsening coronavirus numbers.

The number of confirmed Swedish Covid-19 deaths has risen to more than 650, as of April 9. That brought the death rate per million in Sweden — Scandinavia’s biggest economy — to about 65. By comparison, Denmark’s rate was near 40 while Norway’s was near 20.

And Sweden’s numbers are likely to get even worse: One-third of all of Stockholm’s nursing homes have at least one case of the coronavirus.

In response, the government has taken some important steps, such as restricting gatherings at outside venues to 50 people and telling those at restaurants to sit only at tables, not stand crowded around the bar. It’s also seeking extraordinary powers to impose further measures, which could lead to forced closures of business, schools, airports, railways, and more. The military is also setting up a field hospital in a major conference center in the capital.

“The government is ready to adopt stricter measures to combat the virus whenever we consider it necessary,” Hallengren said.

But virologist Söderberg-Nauclér isn’t buying it: “It’s too late to try and stop” a larger outbreak, she told me.

Which means many Swedes are now potentially at risk of contracting the deadly virus who wouldn’t have been had the government imposed these measures much sooner.

Sweden’s health care system was better prepared than most for a major outbreak

Estimates vary among experts I spoke to, but the country’s health system likely has had somewhere between 500 and 1,000 beds available in hospital intensive care units. This follows a quick ramp-up from the government and lots of funding for a universal health system that’s considered top-tier worldwide, with well-trained physicians.

According to Lindgren of the Swedish Institute of Health Economics, hospitals typically have enough equipment for 48 hours should no shipments of protective equipment like masks arrive. However, he said, the national government has been good about buying and distributing materials to caregivers when needed.

And while physicians are overworked as cases increase, Lindgren said, the number of new admissions to intensive care units over the past two weeks has remained flat, at around 30 to 40 people per day.

Critics, though, note that recent reforms to the nation’s health care system led to an unnecessary shortage in the stockpile of protective materials before the crisis and lower capacity at hospitals.

So Sweden may be better off than most, but it could struggle to deal with a rapid uptick in coronavirus cases like many other countries.

Sweden’s Public Health Agency has a lot of autonomy. That worries some people.

Still, many Swedes see no need to panic. “I think our government is doing the right thing,” Margareta Eriksson, a retired 67-year-old in Stockholm, told the Washington Post this week.

That sense of security comes partly from widespread trust in the Public Health Agency. It’s a mostly independent organization that takes the lead during major public health crises like disease outbreaks and is heavily protected from political interference.

No government minister actually oversees the agency, which gives Tegnell, the government’s chief epidemiologist and response coordinator, a lot of room to make decisions as he sees fit.

“There’s cause for a [government] minister to get sacked if they interfere” with independent public bodies, Lindgren told me. “The scandals that get reported here are when ministers try to place undue influence on the experts.”

That became clear during my interview with Health Minister Hallengren, who said the government defers to the agency on a lot.

For instance, “the government relies on advice from the Swedish Public Health Agency regarding school closures,” she told me. “If the Swedish Public Health Agency makes the assessment that all schools in Sweden should close in order to fight the spread of Covid-19, the government is prepared to do so” after coordinating between the two sets of authorities.

That all seems good on the surface. During a medical crisis — especially one as large as the coronavirus outbreak — it’s important for politicians to step aside and let the experts lead the way. But that only works if the experts offer sound advice, and it’s not clear Tegnell is.

Critics say he’s trying to have the country develop herd immunity, a controversial approach that aims to have many millions contract the disease so the wider population is resistant to infection down the line. It’s an idea that seemed to take hold in governments in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands — before models showing such a policy would merely lead to more deaths led them to change course.

Tegnell firmly denies that developing herd immunity in Sweden is his goal, but he has told reporters it’s “not contradictory” to his aims, either. Stockholm University’s Beckman noted that Tegnell recently said Sweden only has two options: Either everyone gets vaccinated or the country develops herd immunity.

It’s comments like these that make the Karolinska Institute’s Söderberg-Nauclér deeply skeptical of the government’s aims. She and more than 2,000 other academics and experts signed a petition requesting that the government pursue a different strategy. “It’s my responsibility as a scientist” to call them out, she told me. “I don’t trust authorities. I trust data.”

"['Umair Irfan', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,No country has beaten the coronavirus yet,"The Covid-19 coronavirus is threatening to roar back in some countries — like Singapore and South Korea — that had been hailed for swift and effective responses to their outbreaks and are beginning to relax their control measures. It’s a brutal reminder that no country has defeated this virus and that progress against the pandemic is fragile.

Other countries, including Denmark, Austria, and the Czech Republic, are aiming to lift their lockdowns in the coming weeks as well. Ending social distancing is a tempting prospect for the United States, too, as it continues to take a massive economic toll. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned on April 12 that suddenly relaxing these control measures would lead to “extraordinary risk of there being a rebound.”

That’s because even as domestic transmission of the disease declines, with fewer new cases and fewer hospitalizations, there is still a risk of new clusters popping up and of cases being spread from other regions or parts of the world. The solution to the pandemic, then, requires not just large, country-level interventions like mass testing and contact tracing, but also coordinating across borders and bolstering disease responses in more vulnerable countries.

Imported Covid-19 infections are undermining some of the progress in several countries

Tactics ranging from widespread testing to heavy lockdowns to invasive contact tracing have helped reduce the rate of infections, hospitalizations, and fatalities from Covid-19 in several countries already past the epidemic peak.

However, as countries begin to lift these measures, some are starting to see a new uptick in cases. China, for instance, has been fighting the pandemic longer than any other country and for a period managed to limit the increase of new cases.

But it is now starting to see a new rise in Covid-19 infections as regions relax restrictions on movement, allowing in more cases of the disease, many from Chinese citizens returning from abroad.

Even in regions like Wuhan, China, the first epicenter of the outbreak, it’s likely less than 1 percent of the population was ever infected with the virus. That means there is no widespread immunity and that most people can still be infected, so the risk of a new outbreak remains. (Scientists are also still uncertain about whether surviving Covid-19 confers immunity to future infection and, if so, how long that immunity will last.)

Meanwhile, Singapore has not reported any new cases brought from abroad for the past seven days, but it has seen a rise in new infections, largely among foreign workers living in dormitories. And in South Korea, more than 100 people who recovered from the virus tested positive again.

William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, warned that the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in these Asian countries should be instructive for what could happen in the US, after the peak in cases and hospitalizations. Even though the US has the largest number of confirmed cases in the world, the virus has likely only infected a small slice of the population, which means most of the country remains vulnerable to infection.

“This might just offer a glimpse of our future, because it is very hard to believe that the initial surge [of infections] will generate population immunity sufficient to do very much to blunt it in the future,” said Hanage in an email.

The global spread of Covid-19 threatens everyone

As countries try to throttle outbreaks within their borders, the pandemic continues to rage outside and can seep back in.

Infections are now starting to rise in new countries in Africa just as some of the earlier hot spots in Asia and Europe are curbing their caseloads. South Africa, for instance, only reported 27 Covid-19 infections as of April 15, but its current trajectory puts it on track to double every seven days. And many of the countries now facing the pandemic have fewer resources to test, track, and treat the infected.

“My concern is that we’re going have a rise again especially as this pandemic moves through low-income countries or middle-income countries, in particular in the Southern Hemisphere,” said Davidson Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University. “There is going to be a substantial risk for reintroduction, so we’re going to have to keep our guard up.”

In a global economy with a huge amount of international travel, the risk of reemergence of the virus in any given country will remain high, particularly when air travel picks up again.

Ending the pandemic demands international coordination

It’s clear then that no country is out of danger until everyone is out of danger. And it illustrates why the US response to Covid-19 can’t just end at the water’s edge.

“Indeed, global health security means we need to continuously invest in not only our own pandemic preparedness/response, but also in those around us,” said Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist at George Mason University, in an email. “It is important that we support countries struggling with containment and continuously invest in global health security efforts.”

Domestically, countries will still have to lean on social distancing, widespread testing, and good hygiene to limit the spread of the virus. They have to do more rigorous testing of travelers. They will also have to help other countries fight infections through groups like the World Health Organization.

These efforts are critical to controlling the spread of the disease, particularly in areas with fewer health resources to cope with infections.

The fight against the Covid-19 pandemic will be long and costly, and it’s still an open question as to what strategy will work to end the disease. But it’s hard to conceive of a path forward that doesn’t involve countries working together.

"['Alex Ward', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,"The Chris Murphy Doctrine: Trump, coronavirus, and foreign policy","For Chris Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, everywhere he goes is a reminder that his star is on the rise.

On a gray, rainy February evening in Hartford, he spoke for two hours with constituents about why he’d just voted to remove President Donald Trump from office in the Senate impeachment trial. What should have been a stuffy political event turned into a cathartic, almost religious experience for the 100 attendees aggrieved by Washington politics.

With elbows tucked at his side, hands together, and a preacher’s cadence, Murphy regaled the friendly crowd at the University of Connecticut School of Law — his alma mater — with accounts of indignity after indignity.

Trump’s “malfeasance” was destroying our democracy, Murphy said. His Republican colleagues in the Senate had failed to protect the republic by voting to acquit the president. And America’s allies around the world, seeing how Ukraine had been turned into a political weapon by Trump and his GOP enablers, would surely now be rethinking their relationships with the US.

Trump’s impeachment saga, in essence, was a fight for the soul of American foreign policy.

“Once the Trump presidency is over, we won’t have nations coming back to the United States looking for those partnerships, because they will have gotten what they need from others,” he told the nodding public. And after a brief pause, his lament: “That weakens us as a country.”

The senator teased the congregation — “I can give you a longer sermon” — but he knew he’d said enough. His appearance, which began with applause once he entered the hall, ended with a standing ovation.

The fanfare continued later that evening at the senator’s old college haunt, a dimly lit pub called the Half Door, just spitting distance from the law school. Murphy — 46, lean, with coiffed brown hair and a knowing gaze — was spotted the second he walked in with me and a staffer in tow. A few bar patrons walked over to our dark booth to greet him, including a 20-something former soldier whom Murphy, as a House member, had nominated to attend West Point.

“Chris, you changed my life,” Sam said, explaining how he’d left the military to become a public defender in town.

The exchange noticeably lifted Murphy’s mood ahead of our interview, one of five we had over months during the course of my reporting. Aware of what I was after, he knew I’d ask how a junior senator from Connecticut — who gained national fame with his passionate response to the mass shooting of children in his state — got anyone to listen to him on foreign policy. More to the point, why did he want to be listened to on foreign policy?

With a smirk, he put down his burger next to his Moscow mule, locked eyes with me, and slipped right back into that preacher’s lilt.

“I’m 100 percent sure that I’m right about how badly positioned America is in the world today. I’m 100 percent sure this world cannot become a better place unless the United States is an active force for good,” he told me. “I’m 100 percent sure that the foreign policy consensus in Washington has made us less safe. I’m 100 percent sure that the military-industrial complex Eisenhower warned against has become the very nightmare he envisioned.”

“Not everything in domestic politics am I 100 percent sure about,” he continued, “but I am sure that we need a massive reorientation of America’s place in the world.”

The coronavirus crisis is exactly the kind of threat Murphy has long warned about. “I think it’s incredibly sad that we made a choice as a nation to leave ourselves vulnerable,” he told me. He ascribes a lot of the blame to Trump. “President Trump’s obsession with beefing up military coffers left the country more exposed to nonmilitary threats, including pandemics.”

Instead of building more hospitals, the US chose to build more fighter jets and aircraft carriers. Instead of prioritizing the recruitment of medical professionals, the US focused on recruiting more troops. And instead of increasing the ranks of embassy staff that could catch oncoming problems early, the US kept gutting the diplomatic budget. Trump embodied all of these worst tendencies when it was his turn to govern.

In a sense, then, this moment was predetermined.

“We are currently very dependent on medical sourcing from Europe, but the Europeans are in no mood to help the United States today, both because they are facing a crisis and also because we’ve spent the last three years kicking the shit out of them,” he said.

“When times get tough, you need friends,” he continued, “and America doesn’t have a lot of friends right now.”

What makes it worse is that the president Murphy voted to remove from office still uses the playbook that got him impeached in the first place. The governors who pledge fealty to Trump so far have received much of the medical equipment they need from federal authorities. Those who don’t get berated in press conferences and on Twitter.

“What we’re watching, potentially, is Trump using the same tools domestically that he used internationally. What he did to Ukraine he is arguably doing to Michigan, New York, and Connecticut today,” Murphy said. “He sees the money at his disposal as a mechanism to advance his political agenda. We should have removed him from office because he showed no contrition after his extortion campaign in Ukraine, suggesting that he was willing to use those same tactics domestically.”

“When times get tough, you need friends, and America doesn’t have a lot of friends right now”

Does that mean Trump should be removed from office for leading an extremely slow response to the coronavirus outbreak while pressuring states? Not exactly. “President Trump is a constant, evolving tangle of unconstitutional behavior,” Murphy said, but he added that “our focus right now needs to be on getting through the Covid-19 crisis.”

Someday, though, Trump will leave office, and a new president will set the course for American foreign policy. Among other things, they will be tasked with protecting the country against the next pandemic. That requires not only a rethink of how the US acts in the world, but also a wholesale change in how it prepares for what’s to come.

Murphy’s proposed reorientation — his gospel — is what he and others call a “progressive foreign policy,” and he’s proselytized it in bits and pieces since entering Congress shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks.

The US shouldn’t get involved in long-term wars, particularly in the Middle East. The president must get Congress’s approval before committing acts of war. More money should go to diplomats, not the military. Washington should invest in anti-corruption programs to weaken autocracies from Russia to China to Saudi Arabia. Climate change and pandemics are continuous global threats. Fixing and sustaining American democracy is vital to promoting it elsewhere.

This is the foreign policy Book of Murphy.

If those stances sound familiar, it’s because they form part of a growing consensus among the foreign policy left (and some segments of the right). Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have echoed or borrowed from Murphy’s canon. The party, it seems, has finally arrived at where Murphy has long been.

It’s quite the change. The senator for years formed part of a small chorus blasting White Houses for using the old-school foreign policy framework, though not in equal measure.

With President Barack Obama at the helm, Murphy proved an ally, though he criticized the wars in Yemen and Libya, and complicated a congressional effort to authorize strikes in Syria. Now, with Trump in charge, he’s taken up the mantle as a lead antagonist by passing bipartisan legislation to reestablish congressional war powers, meeting with Iranian leaders, and making multiple public appearances to lambaste what he sees as the president’s global missteps.

Murphy’s record shows he wants to be (though he wouldn’t put it in these words) America’s new foreign policy evangelist at a time he feels the country desperately needs one.

“I would love to effectuate a new way of America leading in the world that makes Americans more comfortable with globalism,” he told me in his Senate office. “I worry about the economic unrest in this country, leading us to turn inward and forsaking what I think is a responsibility and duty to lead.”

It’s a mindset that has drawn critics from all sides. The far left says his ideas aren’t as radical as he thinks because he’s unwilling to say America shouldn’t be the world’s top power. The right says he’s too naive, claiming his underemphasis of military strength and lionization of diplomacy — especially with adversaries — makes the US less safe.

The senator welcomes the debate, but he clearly believes he has the way forward for US foreign policy. So do his fans, who say Murphy’s comfort with global affairs, along with gun control and health care, make him the future of the Democratic Party. “Someday, Chris Murphy will be president,” Barbara Rodman, a 72-year-old retired business leader who attended the senator’s speech in Hartford, told me.

Murphy’s allies in Washington are on a similar wavelength.

“I would be very surprised if Chris Murphy, in the next 10 years, isn’t playing a very senior role in a Democratic administration to shape foreign policy,” said California Rep. Ro Khanna, who served as Sanders’s presidential campaign co-chair.

“I would love to effectuate a new way of America leading in the world that makes Americans more comfortable with globalism”

“The testament to his talent is that I could see Sanders, [Elizabeth] Warren, or Biden tapping him for a very senior role,” he told me before Sanders and Warren dropped out, refusing to elaborate. If asked to recommend someone for a top job in a new administration, “Murphy’s would be the first name that would come to my mind,” Khanna said. Multiple reports indicate Biden’s team is working closely with former Sanders campaign members on foreign policy.

The Biden campaign wouldn’t say if it’s considering Murphy as a secretary-of-state candidate right now — it’s not commenting on potential Cabinet positions — but behind the scenes, his name has often come up for that role during the Democratic primary. That said, many I’ve spoken to in Washington say more experienced diplomats, like former top State Department officials William Burns or Wendy Sherman, have the edge for a nod.

Should Murphy stay in the Senate, though, some people note he could carve out a prominent place in the party on foreign policy.

That Murphy has rocketed his way up to the heights of Democratic politics — partly on the back of his left-wing foreign policy views — is a sign of how much the party has shifted in its global thinking. Murphy’s trajectory means he could soon have even greater power to put his convictions into practice.

“I ran for Congress as an opponent of the Iraq War”

Murphy was seen as an aggressive up-and-comer in Connecticut politics in the 1990s, with some even comparing his rise to that of Bill Clinton.

He won a seat in the state’s House of Representatives in 1998 as a 25-year-old and moved over to the state Senate five years later. There, as the co-chair of the legislature’s Public Health Committee, he scored a major win by passing a bill to ban smoking in bars and restaurants. It helped solidify him as not only a local party leader but also one of Connecticut’s next big political stars.

But when he ran for the US House of Representatives in 2006, few thought the “boyish state senator” stood a chance of uprooting Nancy Johnson, the popular moderate Republican who’d held the seat for more than two decades. Murphy’s résumé was good, but others with stronger backgrounds had failed before — including one Democratic candidate whose campaign Murphy managed 10 years earlier.

He still drew confidence — foolishly, he admits — from that experience. “I was 22 years old and had just graduated from college,” Murphy told the Hartford Courant in 2006 of his time managing the campaign. “I was in way over my head and so naive, but because I didn’t know any better, I actually believed we could beat Nancy Johnson and I would only hire people who believed that. Well, it must have worked because we lost by only 1,587 votes.”

Born in White Plains, New York, Murphy had a working-class childhood outside of Hartford that he’s previously described as “Norman Rockwellish.” It’s from his parents that he learned to compete. “My mother taught me to never remain on the sidelines in a fight,” he told the same paper. “And my father taught me that if there is a battle, it’s how you fought it that counts.”

The ambition, though, is all his own. “It must be some recessive gene from an earlier generation that gave him all of this drive,” Murphy’s father added.

Murphy’s 2006 race started out focused primarily on local issues like health care and taxes. But America’s military failures abroad soon put national security and foreign policy at center stage.

The Taliban, the hardline Islamist group George W. Bush’s administration had pushed out of power in 2001, was making a comeback in Afghanistan. On top of that, a presidential commission had concluded just a year earlier that “not one bit” of intelligence about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction program had proved true, and public opinion was turning against the invasion of that country as well.

That growing discontent gave Murphy, who had long opposed both conflicts, a big opening.

“I ran for Congress in 2006 as my friends were being sent off to fight a war that seemed completely unjust,” he told me in his Senate office. “It was people that I knew — my friends and my family — that were being sent over to Iraq and Afghanistan for what seemed like a very unwise mission. So I ran for Congress as an opponent of the Iraq War.”

Johnson, meanwhile, stood by Bush, emphasizing the scourge of terrorism and even calling on Arizona’s John McCain — the most prominent foreign policy voice in her party — to back her. “The security of our people is my No. 1 priority,” she said at a 2006 campaign event in Connecticut before appearing onstage with the Vietnam veteran. The day after the fifth anniversary of 9/11, she put out an ad to label Murphy soft on national security for opposing the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program.

But Murphy still hammered away at what he deemed ill-conceived wars.

“Al-Qaeda and a gentleman named Osama bin Laden attacked this country on September 11, and yet you haven’t heard a lot about them recently because we have focused so much of our energy on one part of this world in Iraq,” he said during a debate that October. “And yet what we know now, from the 16 most important and influential intelligence agencies in this country, is that the focus that we’ve had on Iraq has ... created a breeding ground and training ground for terrorists.”

But like other Democrats at the time, he also showed signs of wanting to help the Bush White House in a worldwide counterterrorism campaign. “We should give this administration every tool we need to go after those terrorists,” he continued. “We should make sure that our military intervention around the globe is hunting down terrorists wherever they are.”

After one of the most expensive and brutal campaigns in Connecticut history, Murphy beat Johnson with 56 percent of the vote. (Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.) He knew then what victory meant for him. “I got to Congress as somebody who had a mandate to try to untangle the United States from our unwise interventions in the Middle East,” he told me in his Senate office.

Murphy didn’t push hard on that mandate at first, as he spent most of his time working on health care reform. But as a member of the House Oversight Committee, he used that platform to highlight the role of private military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan.

During an October 2007 hearing, Murphy confronted Erik Prince, then the head of the mercenary outfit Blackwater, for reaping immense profits from those conflicts. Prince wouldn’t disclose how much money his company had made, drawing the lawmaker’s ire.

“I guess I’m a new member of Congress, but as a representative of my constituents that pay 90 percent of your salary, pay 90 percent of the salaries of your employees, I think it’s a little difficult for us to fathom how that information isn’t relevant to this committee or this Congress,” Murphy said.

Four years later as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he started delivering a consistent antiwar message as a repudiation of Obama’s policies.

In February 2011, protests against longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi spread across Libya. The regime responded brutally, killing more than 100 people in the first few days and sparking an armed rebellion. Qaddafi didn’t take that well: He sent his forces toward Benghazi, calling demonstrators “cockroaches” and promising to cleanse Libya “inch by inch, house by house, home by home, alleyway by alleyway.”

The death toll rose to somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 before NATO allies stepped in. Obama’s advisers saw two options for a military response: a no-fly zone, which wouldn’t do much to combat Qaddafi’s ground forces, or a broader resolution allowing America and its allies to take a more involved stance, including the creation of what became a no-drive zone around rebel forces. The president chose the latter.

“I ran for Congress in 2006 as my friends were being sent off to fight a war that seemed completely unjust”

Murphy offered some qualified support for the mission. It was fine for the US to engage “to avert human disaster,” he said in a March 2011 statement, “but we need to be careful about engaging in a protracted struggle that forces us to pick sides in an emerging civil war.”

“Ultimately, the president has an obligation to bring Congress a detailed plan with specific goals and cost estimates if he is going to do more than provide support to a limited international mission,” he added.

Obama still chose to intervene with the support of NATO allies — and the backing of his party leadership — but without congressional approval. Murphy and most of his House colleagues voted against authorization legislation brought to Congress. While the mission did save lives, it also helped fuel further fighting. For many, the mission ended in failure, and Obama later called his decision the “worst mistake” of his presidency.

That May, Murphy traveled to Afghanistan and didn’t like what he saw. “The fields are still filled with poppy, the Afghan government is still corrupt, and Pakistan is still a problem,” he told constituents at a senior center in Connecticut. “Ten years into this war, more things should be different.” That comment came at the height of Obama’s troop surge to the country, where the president increased the number of US service members to around 100,000 to defeat the Taliban.

Murphy’s experiences with these issues made him thirst for more foreign policy influence, people close to him said. He saw an opportunity to seize it after longtime Sen. Joe Lieberman announced his retirement in 2011.

The following year, Murphy took on billionaire Linda McMahon for the open seat in a campaign that quickly turned nasty and personal. (McMahon declined to comment for this article, citing her work as the chair of Trump’s official political action committee. “All of her public comments will be focused on the 2020 presidential election,” her aide told me.)

When it came to issues, their race focused more on domestic problems, though the ongoing war in Afghanistan did make a cameo. McMahon, like Obama, wanted US troops out of that country by the end of 2014. Murphy wanted a complete US withdrawal sooner than that.

It was a change from his previous stance in support of an aggressive counterterrorism posture, but the messaging was consistent with his congressional record. In 2012, he’d voted against two important defense-spending bills because they included perennial funding for the war (the legislation eventually made it through the chamber). He also voted yes on an amendment sponsored by California Rep. Barbara Lee to permit the use of war funds solely for a full withdrawal.

But Murphy also hinted at his budding, grander worldview in the October debate with McMahon. “Moving forward, we have to be a lot more stingy about how we use American resources abroad, and commit ourselves to the notion that if we do engage in foreign intervention, it has to be in a multilateral basis,” he said. “The biggest mistakes we have made as a nation is when we have gone in alone.”

Murphy would get the chance to promote that vision after beating McMahon — who spent more than $42 million of her own money on the campaign — with 55 percent of the vote.

“I just want to be a really great senator”

Every senator arrives in Washington with grand ambitions. For Murphy’s team, who saw the boss quickly move his way up the national political ranks, a path to the White House didn’t seem so far-fetched.

In an early 2013 meeting, top members of the lawmaker’s staff spoke with Murphy about how to make him a viable presidential contender, according to people familiar with the conversation. Pretty quickly, though, Murphy shut that talk down.

“This is the job I wanted,” he told them. “I just want to be a really great senator.”

Murphy was skeptical that a Senate newcomer from the Northeast could win over the country. Instead, he sensed that becoming a leader in Congress was where his future lay. “He was pretty firm about it,” a former senior staffer told me. “There was no ambiguity there.”

But how to be a really great legislator? Murphy drew inspiration from his predecessors, particularly Lieberman and Chris Dodd, who used their platform as Connecticut lawmakers to push their foreign policies. “I watched my two US senators become not just national figures but international figures,” Murphy told me. “I grew up learning that part of the job of a United States senator was to try and secure America’s place in the world.”

I asked Dodd if he recalled what advice he gave Murphy after the election. The former lawmaker said he told Murphy, who was once an intern in his office, to champion something important. “The most effective members of the Senate are those who pick one or two issues and do deeper dives,” he told me. “Even the people who disagree with you seek you out.”

The expectation during the campaign was that Murphy would dive right into global affairs. “From the beginning, he wanted to have an impact on foreign policy in the Senate,” said another former senior Murphy staffer. Tragedy, though, forced his attention elsewhere.

A shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012 — less than a month before Murphy officially joined the Senate — captured the nation. Twenty children, many as young as 6 years old, and six adults were killed.

Murphy had to respond in a big way on the big stage. He used his first Senate floor speech in April 2013 to do just that.

“In a job like this you’re driven to find the issues that move you,” he said that day. “And then sometimes there are issues that find you. When I was elected to the United States Senate last November, I never imagined that my maiden speech would be about guns or about gun violence.”

He continued:

I think it’s important for all of my colleagues to understand why we’re having this debate this week and next week about gun violence, why for the first time in decades we were able to break the logjam to do something about the waves of violence that have plagued this nation. It’s easy to avert your eyes from the horror of what happened in Newtown. It’s easy to just box your ears and pretend that it didn’t happen. But we can’t ignore the reality because it’s here. And on a disturbingly regular basis it’s here. In Columbine, in Tucson, in Aurora, in Sandy Hook, and the next town’s name is just waiting to be added to the list if we do nothing.

It was an address that marked the first-termer’s arrival. “Murphy gave the most memorable maiden speech of any senator that I have seen in my more than 30 years,” Bill Dauster, who served as deputy chief of staff for policy to then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, told me.

Many close to Murphy say without that speech, his platform would be much smaller today. If he had been unknown to an American audience, he wasn’t anymore.

It wouldn’t be much longer before Murphy had a chance to nab the international spotlight, too.

Murphy and McCain go to Ukraine

In 2013, Murphy became a member of the Democrat-led Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) and served as chair of its subcommittee on Europe. He took to the new job quickly, with one Democratic and two Republican former Senate staffers separately calling him a “workhorse.”

Getting on the committee gave Murphy more opportunities to distinguish himself than he may have first realized.

John Kerry, the SFRC’s longtime chair, had become Obama’s second secretary of state. The new Democratic leadership on the committee was much more centrist and hawkish than the Connecticut senator, and recent elections had moved the Republican delegation further to the right.

“There was an opening for someone with an instinctive progressive view to become a big voice, and Murphy was ahead of the curve,” Rebecca Brocato, who at the time worked on legislative affairs in the State Department, told me.

The world beckoned.

In November 2013, Ukraine’s leadership abruptly reversed a plan to associate with the European Union under pressure from Moscow. Thousands of Ukrainians who wanted to continue the country’s Westward tilt descended on Kyiv’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti — “Independence Square” — to protest the former Soviet territory’s Russia-friendly government.

“The trip in many ways changed my life”

McCain, the strongest Republican foreign policy voice in the Senate, was vocal about his support for the demonstrators. To show solidarity, he planned a visit to the Maidan.

That worried Victoria Nuland, then the top Europe official at the State Department. She liked that someone with McCain’s stature was going to Kyiv, she told me, but she also wanted the trip to be bipartisan. Otherwise, it would look like McCain — a prominent Obama critic — was blasting both Russia and a White House that still hadn’t crafted a coherent response.

What happened next is still fuzzy. Murphy says Nuland called him to “suggest” he speak with McCain about joining the upcoming trip. After all, Murphy was the Europe subcommittee chief and hadn’t yet been to Ukraine. Nuland, however, told me she doesn’t remember inviting Murphy but that it was “possible” she spoke to the Democrat or his staff about approaching McCain.

Either way, Murphy says he and McCain spoke on the Senate floor on Thursday, December 12, when McCain brought up that he would leave for Ukraine that evening to return in time for Monday votes. “If you want to come with me, you can,” Murphy recounted McCain telling him. Murphy accepted the offer.

The two lawmakers were together on the ground in Ukraine for just 16 hours, holding meetings with officials, demonstrators, and civil society groups. “It was a grueling trip,” a former senior McCain aide told me, not least because a congressional visit like that usually takes weeks, not days, to prepare.

But one moment made the whole thing worth it: McCain and Murphy went onstage to address the half-million Maidan protesters who had withstood a month-long government crackdown and braved the cold to hear them speak. “People of Ukraine, this is your moment,” McCain stated, his voice echoing in the open square. “This is about the future you want for your country. This is about the future you deserve.”

Murphy followed: “Ukraine’s future stands with Europe, and the US stands with Ukraine.”

The crowd, desperate for some glimmer of hope, chanted in approval.

The former top McCain staffer told me the senator appreciated having Murphy along. It showed bipartisan support for the cause, and it gave the Arizonan a chance to mentor someone he saw as a future leader. “McCain wanted to take Murphy under his wing,” the staffer added, noting McCain also liked that a junior lawmaker wouldn’t upstage him abroad.

Murphy looks fondly on his years debating America’s role in the world and traveling with the senior lawmaker, even if their conversations could get testy. “I’ve been on the receiving end of a famous McCain shout-down,” he told me.

Still, he recalls the Maidan whirlwind as a formative experience. “The trip in many ways changed my life,” Murphy said at the Hartford bar. “I struck up a relationship with John that lasted for a long time, and I obviously acquired a passion for a policy area, US-Ukraine relations, that stuck.”

More than that, those close to Murphy say he learned from McCain how to play a global role as a US senator. “It’s more than just voting on things,” a former top Murphy aide told me, “it’s about standing up for American values.”

Nuland, who’s from Connecticut, agrees. Murphy “watched McCain and wanted to take up a similar mantle for himself,” she said. “He realized you don’t have to be in the executive branch to play a major role.”

One moment made that clear to Murphy’s team in early 2014, shortly after Russian forces annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. The senator was scheduled to meet with senior Russian diplomats and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s patriarch in Washington. But there was a problem: Both meetings were around the same time. Staffers pushed Murphy to see the religious leader, as the photo opportunity alone would show his growing stature as a serious foreign policy figure.

Instead, Murphy dispatched his aides to meet with the patriarch. He wanted to speak directly to the Russians. “What you have done is outrageous,” a former senior Murphy staffer recalled the senator telling the officials, “and I’m going to do everything in my power to stop you.”

“He just lit into them,” the staffer added. “He spoke with absolute clarity about how wrong they were.” There were few reservations about what inspired Murphy to do that: “Some of that comes from his relationship with McCain.”

During the Obama years, “there was an opportunity to be in the foreign policy arena”

Murphy had a rapport with President Obama, too. “As the administration focused on prioritizing diplomacy, Murphy was seen as an ally,” said Brocato, the former State Department legislative official. Top Democrats, especially on the SFRC, were critical of Obama’s willingness to talk to adversaries instead of meeting them with firepower.

The politics made Murphy a foreign policy partner from the start. But it didn’t stop him or his staff from letting the administration know when they thought a grave error was made. “There were times we wanted to yell, ‘How did you people come to this conclusion?’” a senior Murphy staffer told me.

Indeed, the period from 2013 to 2015 led to a major fight, a major agreement, and a major fight again.

The first disagreement came on whether to bomb Syria.

In August 2013, Bashar al-Assad’s forces killed, by some estimates, more than 1,400 people with sarin gas, a particularly horrifying chemical weapon that can cause paralysis, convulsions, or death. That put immense pressure on Obama, who didn’t directly intervene for two years but did say Assad’s use of chemical weapons would cross his “red line.”

Top officials in Obama’s team were pushing the president to respond with a military strike, arguing the situation demanded the US do something and that Obama had painted himself into a political corner.

The Connecticut lawmaker couldn’t have disagreed more. “There is little chance that targeted air strikes would destroy Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles, making the strikes little more than a slap on the wrist,” he said in an August 27 statement, adding “the US should not take military action without Congressional authorization.”

Murphy and Obama spoke on the phone after the senator’s statement came out, his team told me, and the lawmaker used the opportunity to reiterate his concerns. Murphy also got a chance to chat with then-Vice President Biden and other White House officials about Syria.

It’s unclear whether Murphy’s remarks had an effect, but caught between an impulse to act and his own skepticism of unilateral intervention, Obama on September 1 asked Congress for an authorization to attack Syria. “It is too easy for a president to go to war,” he privately told aides about his decision, saying he’d have more legitimacy for the action if lawmakers backed him.

Democratic leadership, which wanted to authorize the strikes, didn’t like that they couldn’t count on Murphy’s vote. “It caused some consternation because it became an obstacle for Reid and [New Jersey Sen. Robert] Menendez to do what was asked by the president,” said Tommy Ross, a top defense and intelligence adviser to Senate Majority Leader Reid at the time. He noted that almost everyone thought Murphy’s objections were reasonable, including the senator’s worry that strikes might make it easier for terrorist groups to get their hands on chemical weapons.

The SFRC went ahead with an authorization vote on September 4, passing the legislation and nominally giving Obama the approval he sought. Murphy was one of only two Democrats who voted against it.

In the end, Obama never attacked. His administration struck a surprise deal with Russia roughly a week later to have Syria’s chemical weapons destroyed in exchange for holstering the bombs. Syria, though, continued to use chemical weapons afterward to kill civilians.

Looking back on the ordeal during our first chat last December, Murphy seemed more critical of America’s involvement in Syria in hindsight than he was at the time. Obama didn’t bomb the country, but he did wade into the conflict early through a covert rebel arming and training program to depose Assad.

“If the United States hadn’t spent money and resources propping up the rebels in the early days, we likely would have gotten the exact same outcome with a lot less bloodshed, terror, and torture,” he told me. “Sometimes US involvement doesn’t change the outcome. It just lengthens the misery between the beginning of the conflict and the inevitable end of it.”

Murphy and Obama got on the same page in 2015.

The administration faced stiff resistance from Republican and anti-Iran Democrats as it pushed for a nuclear pact. As the White House and State Department looked for an ally in Congress, they didn’t have one in top SFRC Democrats like Menendez or Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin. Instead, they relied on Murphy.

“Murphy was willing to have the fight,” Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, told me. “He was totally committed to the approach we were taking.” Obama’s team desperately needed someone in the Senate staunchly on their side, as the body had passed a measure that May allowing it to vote on any deal the Obama team agreed to.

“Sometimes US involvement doesn’t change the outcome. It just lengthens the misery between the beginning of the conflict and the inevitable end of it.”

It put any accord in jeopardy. Obama would surely veto any rejection, but the Senate could still muster up enough support to override it. Murphy went on the attack to help the Iran deal survive.

Just over a week after the US, Iran, and five other world powers put pen to paper in July, Murphy was working the Washington think tank circuit.

“The vote on this agreement does not take place in a vacuum,” he told an audience at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “If the US Congress rejects this deal” — noting it was the world’s only parliamentary body voting on the accord — “then two things happen. One, the sanctions fall apart. And two, the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program don’t go into effect. Period. Stop.”

“Anyone positing an alternative is frankly living in some sort of alternate universe,” he continued.

He made that stance official on the Senate floor in August, when few Senate Democrats had come out in favor of approving the agreement and when it was still unclear there would be a veto-proof majority. It was only the following month that enough senators backed the deal to guarantee Congress couldn’t sink it.

Obama, with Murphy’s help, had won. “The support he played in understanding and communicating the value of the deal — more than the vote — was very significant,” Richard Nephew, who worked on the nuclear accord in the Obama administration, told me.

The honeymoon didn’t last.

Murphy was a critic of Saudi Arabia’s war against Houthi rebels in Yemen from the moment it started in early 2015, and especially after the US agreed to provide Riyadh with intelligence and aerial refueling support.

“He was a lonely voice on Yemen before it attracted the attention of everyone else,” a former senior staffer told me. Murphy worked the phones, calling Senate colleagues from both parties to see if anything could be done to help the more than 21 million desperately endangered Yemenis. But his anger was also directed at the Saudis, and as a punishment he aimed to drive a wedge in Washington’s decades-long ties to Riyadh.

“There are more and more things not to like about the state of our relationship,” he told a Council on Foreign Relations audience in 2016. After chastising the country for its promotion of Wahhabism — a conservative, extremist Islamic ideology that has inspired several terror groups — he said “the United States should suspend supporting Saudi Arabia in the military campaign in Yemen ... until we make some progress in the Saudi export of Wahhabism.”

In September 2016, Murphy, along with another Democrat and two Republicans, forced a vote to block more than $1 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which would have put a hold on 150 US-provided tanks. The measure was struck down, 71 to 27. Murphy sold it as a moral win in interviews for having at least shown the relationship’s future was in question. But his optimism belied what was still a controversial view in Washington.

He told me in his Senate office during an interview for this piece that he hoped the US stepping back from its relationship with Saudi Arabia could lead to that country’s improved ties with its regional enemy: Iran.

“The Saudis would be much more interested in trying to reconcile, in some way, shape, or form, with the Iranians if they didn’t have an unconditional, unending flow of arms coming to them from the United States,” he said.

Put together, Murphy’s actions set him apart from Obama foreign policy loyalists. But he received plaudits from some in the White House, the Senate, and the public for standing by his principles regardless of who opposed him.

It helped distinguish him as a leading foreign policy voice. Even Rhodes, who spent all eight years in the Obama administration, told me he’s now come closer to Murphy’s way of thinking about the world, as evidenced by the articles they’ve written together.

When I asked a former senior staffer if Murphy aimed for notoriety during the Obama era, there was a slight, knowing pause before I got an answer. “There was an opportunity to be in the foreign policy arena,” the staffer said.

Murphy vs. Trump

In April 2017, just four months into Trump’s presidency and after years of crafting his own foreign policy vision, Murphy wrote down his doctrine.

Titled “Rethinking the Battlefield,” it outlined in about 60 pages Murphy’s views on how the United States should reallocate funds to better deal with a complicated world. Spending so much on the military wasn’t helping the US make more friends than enemies, he argued. Global players like an aggressive China, a revanchist Russia, and a nimble ISIS showed they were adapting their strategies to gain power and influence, all while the US was stuck believing it could create peace through strength alone.

His solution? Increase America’s spending on international affairs by $50 billion, cut part of the military budget, and put those new resources into three main buckets. First, major assistance initiatives that alleviate the conditions that make violent extremism more attractive. Second, a new American presence abroad that leads more with diplomats than with troops and supports anti-corruption measures. Third, efforts to “help prevent humanitarian disasters from becoming strategic disasters” by making the US an even greater donor for at-risk people around the world.

“This budget is a blueprint for a radically new approach to American foreign policy, one that will give us the best chance to address the threats that face us in the 21st Century,” he concluded. This, in toto, was a clear distillation of his so-called progressive foreign policy.

Unsurprisingly, someone with this view of the world would be unhappy with Trump’s. On almost every issue, Murphy has vociferously opposed what the commander in chief has done.

War powers and Yemen

The first clash, beginning in earnest in 2018, was over the war in Yemen.

Murphy still wanted to end America’s involvement, while Trump quickly sided with Saudi Arabia and wanted to help Riyadh defeat the Houthis. After all, Iran was helping the rebels fight the kingdom, and the Trump administration was anti-Iran from the start.

Sanders, the longtime Vermont senator and Murphy’s ally in this cause, had an idea. He wanted to propose a War Powers Resolution that would direct Trump to remove US troops involved in “hostilities” abroad if there was no formal “declaration of war or specific statutory authorization” from Congress.

Sanders brought Murphy and Utah Republican Mike Lee into his effort. Each wanted to reestablish Congress as the rightful branch of government to declare war while simultaneously ending America’s role in a humanitarian catastrophe. The three co-sponsored the measure and pushed for a vote in March, when Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — known as MBS — was in Washington. The resolution, though, was defeated handily, 55 to 44.

The calculus changed dramatically when MBS ordered a plan to kill Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, who lived in Virginia and worked for the Washington Post, that October in Turkey. Even staunch Trump and Saudi allies in the Senate like South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham turned against Riyadh.

“It is not in our national security interests to look the other way when it comes to the brutal murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,” Graham said in a November statement. “When we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset.” That month, the Senate voted in a procedural step to consider the resolution and not outright reject it — a win in itself. Caving to pressure, the Trump administration stopped refueling Saudi planes but continued to offer reconnaissance support.

The Senate war powers trio sniffed out another chance to hit Riyadh where it hurt. In December, they and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul met to discuss a way forward. Matt Duss, Sanders’s top foreign policy adviser, told me the feeling among the staff was that a war powers caucus was forming.

“There was a real appreciation for the fact that our bosses were coming together to do something literally unprecedented, and working through ideas that could form the basis for a new and better foreign policy consensus,” he told me.

Sanders, Murphy, and Lee agreed to introduce the legislation again, this time in January 2019. After two months of debate, it passed 54 to 46. One month later, the Democrat-led House approved the measure 247 to 175. The resolution, once almost impossible to imagine sailing through Congress, was headed to the president’s desk.

“I’ve been waiting years for this day to come,” Murphy said in a statement after the House vote. “Democrats and Republicans in Congress sent a powerful message to the Saudi government — they can no longer take their alliance with the United States for granted, and we will not stand idly by while the [Saudis] continue to kill thousands of civilians in our name.”

As expected, Trump vetoed the Sanders-led initiative, and the Senate didn’t have enough votes to override the president’s decision. To this day, the US still helps the Saudis conduct the war in Yemen by providing military advice and intelligence sharing, with American defense officials insisting they take all necessary measures to reduce the risk of civilian casualties. Meanwhile, more than 100,000 Yemenis have died, a humanitarian catastrophe with no end in sight — and little relief from the Trump administration.

But Murphy and his colleagues do feel they accomplished something important: reasserting Congress’s constitutional role in declaring war.

Duss thinks Murphy taking gambles like that is what’s helped his rise. “He’s broken through because he’s put in the work and understands the issues, he communicates them clearly, and he has courage,” Duss told me. “The courage part, that’s a very rare thing in Washington.”

Venezuela

On January 23, 2019, Venezuela had two presidents.

The first was Nicolás Maduro, the socialist dictator who squandered his nation’s economic potential and ruined the lives of millions. The second was the head of the country’s National Assembly, Juan Guaidó. He claimed to be the nation’s true leader because Maduro had rigged the previous year’s presidential election. By Venezuelan law, that meant he would take the reins until a new, free election could take place to choose the next president.

The United States immediately backed Guaidó. And while dozens of other countries did as well, Trump’s leadership of the effort fueled suspicions that Washington wanted regime change in Caracas.

Murphy’s analysis was more measured. Only six days after the uprising, he and Rhodes wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post praising Trump for backing a pro-democratic effort but criticizing him for doing so with no real plan. “In Venezuela, if the armed forces continue to back Maduro, then last week’s move may come to look feckless, while offering Maduro the opportunity to rally his domestic and foreign backers against US intervention,” they wrote.

That’s exactly what happened. Despite some defections, the Venezuelan military and security forces remain loyal to Maduro. Even after the US has imposed crushing sanctions on Caracas, the dictator remains in the presidential mansion, blaming America for the nation’s ills, while Guaidó still works to dislodge him.

The ordeal is an encapsulation of Murphy’s critique of US foreign policy in general. Yes, Washington is the strongest nation on earth. Unleashing its economic muscle on Venezuela — and threatening military action — on the surface seems effective enough to get what it wants. But not in today’s world, not even against a weak regime in Venezuela.

“It’s time for President Trump to realize that his Venezuela policy has failed, badly,” Murphy wrote for Univision in November.

Iran

In May 2018, Trump followed through on his campaign promise to end US participation in the Iran nuclear deal. The president felt the time limits on the pact put Tehran on the path to a nuclear weapon — not off it — and so he reimposed previously lifted sanctions to force the Iranians to sign a more stringent agreement.

As expected, Republicans cheered and Democrats jeered. Few were as angry as Murphy, who fought tooth and nail in the Obama years to keep the pact intact.

“Pulling out of the Iran deal is like a soccer player deliberately kicking the ball into their own team’s goal,” he said in a statement the day of the withdrawal. “There is nothing but downside for the US, especially since Trump has zero plan for what comes next ... and it makes Connecticut and our nation less safe.”

Over the next year and a half, Iran decided not to negotiate with the Trump administration. Instead, it started to lash out by bombing oil tankers and Saudi oil refineries, and having proxies launch rockets at Americans in the Middle East.

In January 2020, Trump responded to the escalation by killing Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s second-most-powerful person and the leader of its elite military force. Murphy bashed that decision.

“No matter how good it may feel that Qassem Soleimani is no longer alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, our troops, and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing military adversary,” he said the day after the killing. “There will be reprisals, and Iran will likely target American troops and even our own political and military leaders.

“This is why the United States does not assassinate leaders of foreign nations — in the end such action risks getting more, not less, Americans killed in the long run,” he concluded.

Worried that US-Iran tensions might spiral out of control, Murphy chose to do something about it, knowing full well it would anger the president.

As Murphy’s team told me, during a planning call for the congressional delegation to February’s Munich Security Conference, the senator’s staff told the US Embassy in Germany that Murphy wanted to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. The embassy replied it couldn’t set up the meeting. Plan B was for Murphy’s aides to work with a facilitator — whose name staff wouldn’t disclose — to organize the chat. That proved successful.

After days of silence, Murphy acknowledged in a Medium post that he had met with the top Iranian diplomat while in Munich (other lawmakers also attended the meeting). The two had talked before, but this was a tenser time, especially after the president had ordered the killing of such a high-level figure.

“I have no delusions about Iran — they are our adversary, responsible for the killing of thousands of Americans and unacceptable levels of support for terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East,” Murphy wrote. “But I think it’s dangerous to not talk to your enemies. Discussions and negotiations are a way to ease tensions and reduce the chances for crisis. But Trump, of course, has no such interests.”

The president chastised Murphy for the meeting on Twitter, saying he had violated the Logan Act, which forbids private US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.

Kerry & Murphy illegally violated the Logan Act. This is why Iran is not making a deal. Must be dealt with strongly! https://t.co/RpTW9c09ZY — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2020

Murphy rebuffs any such suggestion. “I think it’s my job to meet with foreign leaders, especially in the Middle East, given that I’m the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees that region,” he told me.

I asked him if he wouldn’t mind a Republican lawmaker meeting with a foreign leader whom a Democratic president deemed an enemy of the country. He dodged but didn’t discount the idea. “If I couldn’t meet with leaders of countries where I have a disagreement with the president over policy, then I wouldn’t be able to meet any leader in the world,” Murphy told me.

The coronavirus

Trump’s slow response to deal with the coronavirus has garnered Murphy’s ire.

Despite China’s initial cover-up and late reporting of the new disease, Trump spent much of February praising Beijing and failing to prepare the government for a potential spike in infections at home. One of his most egregious mistakes was initially refusing to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA), a Korean War-era law that gives the federal government broad powers to direct private companies to make and sell vital materials.

Had he used it much earlier in 2020, experts say, US hospitals might have all the masks, gowns, respirators, and ventilators they desperately need today. Instead, states are now competing against one another for scarce resources, and some health workers are forced to wear bandanas or makeshift materials to protect themselves.

“The medical supply system has turned into Lord of the Flies”

With his Senate colleague Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Murphy put forward legislation on March 23 to require Trump to federalize the production and distribution of medical equipment like masks and ventilators (a companion effort followed in the House the next day).

Per the press release, the bill specifically would “force President Trump to identify private sector capacity to help nothing less than 500,000,000 N95 respirators; 200,000 medical ventilators; 20,000,000 face shields; 500,000,000 pairs of gloves; and 20,000,000 surgical gowns in addition to other medical equipment deemed necessary.”

The crisis required an all-hands-on-deck approach. “The medical supply system has turned into Lord of the Flies,” Murphy wrote in Barron’s on March 31, “and the only way to fix this desperately broken system is aggressive federal action.”

The measure hasn’t been taken up in Congress, and Trump seems to still prefer states battle against one another for resources. So Murphy has offered up his own strategy for dealing with this and other pandemics.

In a March 30 op-ed for Foreign Policy magazine, the senator said the US should take three actions to minimize the threat of the next global disease epidemic.

First, the US should revive the US Agency of International Development’s PREDICT program, which helped the country prepare for pandemics. Trump shut it down in October 2019. Second, America should create a “Global Health Security Challenge Fund” to build up the health infrastructures of other nations. Third, the country should “supersize” its global public health corps.

That last measure could only come with more funding. “Clearly we are not adequately protecting our nation when the military budget is nearly $740 billion and the global public health budget is only $11 billion,” Murphy concluded.

He continues to hammer the president over coronavirus. In a viral Twitter thread on April 1, the lawmaker effectively blamed Trump for a death total that could needlessly reach 200,000 people, as the White House itself estimated at the time. “The problem isn’t that Trump’s doing the wrong things,” Murphy wrote. “The problem is he’s effectively doing nothing.”

1/ Hear me out:



If you're criticizing Trump's Coronavirus response as ineffective, you're doing it wrong.



The problem is - for all practical purposes - there has been NO RESPONSE.



The Administration has effectively declared surrender.



And 200,000 might die because of this. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) April 1, 2020

Put together, Trump and Murphy couldn’t be more diametrically opposed. A foreign policy more aligned with the senator’s view would alter the course America is on. If a Democrat wins the presidential election in November, it’s more likely than not the new commander in chief will pursue policies more in line with Murphy’s view.

The question is how much of a direct role Murphy would want to have in such an administration.

What does Chris Murphy really want?

Chris Murphy doesn’t want to be president — at least for now. As early as 2017, he told reporters he wouldn’t run in 2020 despite efforts to get him into the race. He seems intent on building up his foreign policy credentials while in the Senate, which he’ll have time to do after easily winning a second term in office in 2018.

He’s now calling for dramatic increases to the State Department’s budget and staff, which he thinks will help the US better understand other nations while having the requisite resources to enact everything from anti-corruption policies to economic projects. America’s penchant for leading with troops, instead of with diplomats, is a major reason America is losing its influence to growing powers, he says.

Murphy’s core belief is that a progressive foreign policy is about capabilities. The US has the tools and resources to make a better world, if only it would actually employ them in a meaningful way. If it doesn’t, American power will wane.

Some to Murphy’s left on foreign policy say the problem with this vision is that it’s still rooted in the romantic notion of American primacy. The senator still wants the US to be No. 1, and all his proposals are in service of that goal.

Stephen Wertheim of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, an anti-interventionist think tank, thinks that’s the wrong mindset. “A progressive foreign policy is about objectives as well as capabilities,” he told me. “It’s about rejecting the failed and immoral objective of military domination and finally committing the resources of the United States to the major challenges the American people face: crumbling communities, global warming, and ungoverned wealth.”

But Murphy’s worldview is popular enough that talk has ramped up about what’s next for the 46-year-old senator. Some top Democrats, including those involved in presidential campaigns, suggest he’s certainly on a shortlist of people to be the nation’s top diplomat, which has some Connecticut and party elders excited. “I think he’d be a good secretary of state,” Lieberman, the former senator, told me.

Others say there are more prominent figures in the wings who deserve it more, especially longtime diplomats who understand the intricacies of foreign policy more intimately.

Most people I spoke to say it would be best for Murphy to remain in the Senate. He’s proven effective in the body and could serve as an important asset to any Democratic president when trying to push a foreign policy initiative through Congress.

In fact, those close to him say he should aim to be — if it isn’t his goal already — the McCain of the left. Murphy’s voice on foreign policy is perhaps the strongest in his party. With his probable longevity in Congress, his influence is only likely to grow. “He could be a McCain for the Democrats in the Senate for the next 20 years,” Ben Rhodes told me.

Murphy doesn’t take kindly to pointed questions about his future. I asked different versions of the same question countless times, only to be rebuffed on each occasion.

But he did tell me that there’s still a lot he wants to accomplish. “I want to make sure that we’re still a factor for good in the world and I want to be able to lead,” he said in his office. “I’m hopeful to be able to paint a path forward by which Americans feel better about us continuing to be involved in the world.”

Whether he’ll do that from behind his Senate desk or some other seat in Washington is one issue with global implications Murphy won’t talk about.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,12 experts on how the US should hold China accountable for the coronavirus,"Pressure is mounting on President Donald Trump to take action against China for its role in hiding the severity of the coronavirus outbreak. And what he chooses to do could greatly impact not only the future of the pandemic, but also the world’s most important global relationship.

Republican lawmakers want Trump to consider harsh measures against Beijing such as sanctioning Chinese leaders, opening a formal investigation into the disease’s origins, removing Chinese pharmaceutical companies from America’s supply chain, and more.

So far, Trump’s only retribution for the outbreak of over 2 million cases worldwide has been against the World Health Organization (WHO), an international body that helps countries identify and curb pandemics. On Tuesday, Trump announced he was freezing US funding for the WHO while his administration reviews how the organization handled the early signs of a health crisis out of Wuhan, China, the disease’s origination point.

But if Trump actually wanted to reprimand Beijing, what would be the best way for him to do that? To get a better sense of the options available to him, I asked 12 policy experts, including US lawmakers, former top US officials, and academics, what actions they’d recommend the president take.

Their responses, lightly edited for length and clarity, are below.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), ranking member, Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and Cybersecurity Policy

First, we need to be clear that we are talking about the Chinese government and ruling party, not the people of China. That’s important not only to prevent further escalation of the destructive anti-Asian racism we see here at home, but also to recognize Chinese doctors and nurses who were on the front lines from the start, independent Chinese journalists persecuted for their coverage, and people across China using the internet to echo Dr. Li Wenliang’s call for greater transparency, only to be silenced by censors.

We don’t know the true extent of the Chinese government’s complicity in the spread of the virus, and we may never have a full picture due to their obfuscation and control of information. We do know that they lied to their own people and the world about the details and spread of the virus, and today we face a pandemic that has left no country untouched.

We need a deliberate US effort to counter Chinese influence and manipulation of international institutions. The administration cannot complain about an increasingly assertive China in international organizations, such as the WHO, when it fails to appoint diplomats to top posts and uses its own yearly contributions as blunt instruments rather than tools to shape policies in our interests. When the United States is absent on the world stage, China is only too happy to fill the void. This endangers our health security and national security.

Looking forward, we need to make sure that the United States has a medical supply chain that is not reliant on China or other foreign suppliers. We need to restore a stronger US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presence in China, as well as an embedded US presence in the Chinese CDC and unimpeded international access to identify the origins of the coronavirus.

The United States must also lead action in the UN Security Council to ensure that in the event of a declared health emergency, all countries grant on-the-ground access to WHO officials, as well as require that all countries transparently disseminate timely public health information to the WHO and to their own people. The WHO should no longer be at the mercy of a single member-state for information that affects the security of all countries.

And we need a commission akin to the 9/11 Commission, as I have called for, that recommends further actions to ensure that the mistakes that led to this health pandemic never happen again.

Jacob Stokes, senior policy analyst in the China program, US Institute of Peace

The US response should focus on establishing the facts surrounding the virus’s origins and China’s early missteps in a credible, impartial, and scientific manner. This approach makes sense for two reasons.

The first is that, based on reliable reporting about China’s initial fumbling, the facts appear to be damning on their own. The United States should make sure that evidence of Chinese mishandling and politicization of the problem is exhaustively documented and well-understood around the world. Washington should recognize, however, that letting the facts speak for themselves will be more convincing to third parties than trying to embellish or sensationalize. The United States should show, not tell.

Second, in the contest of governance systems between liberal democracy and authoritarian capitalism, openness and transparency are advantages — the lack of which seemingly allowed the virus to take hold in the first instance. Ensuring the facts are brought to light in a credible way, in conjunction with allies and multilateral organizations, will pressure China to take responsibility. And it could result in other positive outcomes as well, such as further boosting Taiwan’s image abroad.

Next, if one of the two leading theories about the virus’s origin — that it started in a Wuhan wet market, or that it accidentally escaped a Chinese lab that was studying animal coronaviruses — turns out to be correct, then pressuring Beijing to fix disastrous regulatory and enforcement failures should obviously be a top priority. The same goes for upholding China’s commitments to international public health agreements.

The overriding goal of any response, though, should be preventing another pandemic. Policymakers should avoid creating incentives for any country, including China, to avoid reporting a potential outbreak in the future for fear of being blamed or punished. Imposing sanctions on Chinese officials or allowing victims to sue China for Covid-19-related damages could dissuade countries from sounding the alarm early next time.

I generally favor taking a tougher line toward China on a range of policy issues, from its assertive military behavior to its human rights crackdown and abusive trade practices. But there should be some issues both superpowers try to separate from geopolitical competition, even if they won’t be 100 percent successful, because those issues are fundamentally negative-sum games.

Nobody “wins” a pandemic. We should keep that in mind right now.

Michelle Murray, director of global initiatives, Bard College

First, the United States should not use China as a scapegoat for the pandemic and its failed response at home. When the Trump administration refers to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” it not only conjures up racist stereotypes that are unethical in their own right, but also serves to shift the blame for the pandemic squarely onto China.

Without a doubt, China’s failure to be transparent about the emergence of the virus in November and its failure to involve international health experts to manage the containment led the disease to spread throughout the world. It is also true, however, that the United States is the current epicenter of the pandemic in no small part because of the bungled response of the Trump administration and its failure to organize even minimal preparations.

Put simply, the blame-shifting from the Trump administration elides the fact that both China and the United States bear responsibility in creating the conditions that exist today. An important effect of this rhetoric is that it positions China as a lesser, distinctly incapable global power relative to the superior United States, which in turn, precludes the kind of international cooperation that a pandemic requires.

Second, the United States must actively seek China’s help in understanding and containing the novel coronavirus. These efforts should include the creation of an international working group to coordinate efforts to address the pandemic, whose mandate encourages the sharing of scientific expertise among states in order to guide policy.

“Nobody ‘wins’ a pandemic.” — Jacob Stokes, US Institute of Peace

As the first country to experience the pandemic, Chinese scientists have unique knowledge to contribute to such an effort and could take a leading role in shaping the global response to the disease. By designing a response that engages China on the science of the virus, the US may recognize the important role China can play in this area, while also sidestepping the many thorny political dynamics that have characterized US-China relations over the past several years.

Whatever form it takes, recognition and cooperation must be at the center of any American response to China’s role in the spread of the coronavirus. If done with care, these cooperative endeavors could provide the foundation for cooperation in other areas of US-China relations in the years to come.

Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health, Council on Foreign Relations

There is really not much the US can do. We could blame China for causing the outbreak, but the US was the origin of the 1918 Spanish flu [Editor’s note: this is still disputed] and arguably the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

We could say that China should be held accountable for the pandemic, especially given its initial mishandling of the outbreak. But our own handling of the outbreak was characterized by inaction and ineffectiveness, not to mention that in international politics, we cannot really hold a sovereign state “accountable” for a disease outbreak.

Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA), chair, House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation

China has not been a responsible international partner in the global fight against Covid-19.

China’s lack of transparency and cooperation with the global health community, including the United States, slowed down our understanding of the virus and how to contain it — putting the world at far greater risk. In the critical early stages of the virus, China refused to allow international experts to come to the epicenter of the virus and suppressed information about the severity of the virus. China is culpable for their inactions and mismanagement.

But in order for us to ultimately defeat Covid-19, it will require a coordinated global response. As one of the world’s most powerful countries, China is a critical actor in the fight against coronavirus and any future pandemic outbreak.

Moving forward, it’s incumbent that China understands the important role it plays in the global health community and acts as a responsible and transparent partner. As chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, I will continue to press the global community, including China, to do everything it can to prevent another pandemic outbreak like Covid-19.

Ryan Hass, China director on the National Security Council from 2013 to 2017; fellow, Brookings Institution

No one who has been closely watching the unfolding of this pandemic could conclude that it had emerged from anywhere other than China, or that China’s negligent initial response to the outbreak did not contribute to its spread. The world knew all of this, even before Washington and Beijing prodded each other into a counterproductive narrative war.

It’s deeply unfortunate that the world’s two most capable powers are consumed by finger-pointing and blame-shifting while the pandemic spreads, literally killing thousands and destroying economies in its wake.

The United States will not be able to protect its people until it stamps out the virus in every corner of the world. Such an outcome will not be possible unless a consortium of powers pools its capabilities to do so. It’s hard to imagine that occurring until the United States and China find a way toward even a minimal level of coordination (e.g., on vaccine trials, production, and delivery).

To keep the focus where it needs to be in the midst of this crisis — saving lives and stopping the spread of the virus — it would be helpful if both Washington and Beijing could commit now, that after the crisis has passed, they both will fully and transparently support a UN-led after-action report of Covid-19, whereby leading scientists could determine the origin of the virus, causes of its rapid spread, and lessons that must be learned to prevent a recurrence.

Jiaqi Liang, assistant professor, University of Illinois at Chicago

In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, both the US and China had moments of mismanagement. Amid the escalated feud between the two countries, we have seen the importance of their interconnection and the negative impacts of worsened US-China relations.

China has played a critical role in the global supply chain, including pharmaceutical active ingredients and personal protective equipment (PPE), which are in high demand in many countries. Also, to fight the pandemic, we need close cooperation and communication among the global scientific and public health care communities, in which China is an important actor with much-needed experiences and lessons.

Meanwhile, the widespread economic fallout in the US and Europe has taken a toll on China’s economy, even if the latter has tried to jump-start its economic activities after a months-long lockdown.

Looking ahead, the US and China should rebuild their relations through mutual understanding, continued dialogue, and long-term collaboration.

Daniel Russel, US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 2013 to 2017; vice president, international security and diplomacy, Asia Society Policy Institute

Accountability is needed for China’s failure to close its “wet markets,” as it pledged to do after the SARS outbreak; its failure to inform the world promptly of the dangerous new pathogen emerging in Wuhan; and the initial cover-up that allowed the new virus to spread far beyond Wuhan and spill across international borders.

But the ability of the US to lead an appropriate response depends on Washington restoring lost credibility. So first and foremost, the US government needs to launch an effective effort to stem the outbreak in America, aid afflicted countries, lead global coordination through the G20 and the WHO, and rapidly produce a vaccine against the coronavirus.

Only then will the US have the credibility needed to hold China to account.

Maria Adele Carrai, associate research scholar, Weatherhead East Asian Institute at Columbia University

It would be an error for the US to blame China as “responsible” for the Covid-19 outbreak.

According to the International Health Regulations (2005), state parties have reporting requirements. They have to inform the WHO of all cases of human influenza caused by a new subtype in their territories within 24 hours. While China did not report immediately, and contributed to a delay in the global response, it cannot be considered the culprit in a pandemic.

The reason is that there is no proper definition of international responsibility for pandemics. In practice, no single actor has been held accountable for pandemics so far. And while the US can continue to promote reforms in China and reestablish dialogue and trust, the best response is to increase cooperation with the international community and lead the development of international health law.

Following the example of President George W. Bush’s International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza, the US could also lead new forms of international cooperation to increase international coordination, transparency, and international capacity to identify and contain new pandemics.

This is not the time for the US to withdraw from international organizations. It is time to actively participate in them and reform them, filling the gaps in pandemic accountability and responsibility.

Aaron Friedberg, professor of politics and international affairs, Princeton University; author, A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia

The time to press for a full accounting of Beijing’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic will be once the current crisis has begun to recede.

For the moment, without getting our hopes up, we should remain open to the possibility of cooperating with China in fighting the virus and coping with its consequences. At the same time, however, we should vigorously counter Beijing’s efforts to rewrite history and cast itself as a savior and a model rather than as the source of this catastrophe.

In the somewhat longer term, the United States and other like-minded countries should create an independent, international “truth commission” to explore the origins and unfolding of the pandemic.

Aside from whatever happens with China, the US and other democracies should work together to enhance coordination and improve cooperation on a wide range of issues, including reducing their dependence on China for the drugs, medical devices, and other equipment that will be needed to fight the next global outbreak of infectious disease.

Mary Gallagher, director of the Center for Chinese Studies, University of Michigan

The US should highlight China’s missteps through open sources of information, especially our media institutions and academic research. In particular, investigative journalists and academic researchers should analyze China’s official data on infections and deaths as there is likely significant underreporting.

We should highlight the institutional and regulatory failures that led to the delay in reporting and to the punishment of whistleblowers, activists, and journalists, which continues to this day. Media outlets outside of China should continue to highlight the censorship, repression, and information control that squash independent Chinese voices.

More generally, there should be a strong pushback against the official Chinese Communist Party narrative that President Xi Jinping and the party [have asserted], instead of against China’s citizens, civil society, and health care workers.

The US should reverse its decision to halt funding to the WHO. It should admit to its own mistakes from late January until early March in downplaying the severity of the virus. And it should spearhead an international effort to control the pandemic and develop a successful vaccine.

Marine Lt. Gen. Chip Gregson (Ret.), US assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs from 2009 to 2011; senior adviser, Avascent Global Advisors

The best thing we could do in the wake of China’s past actions is to lead the international response, building networks of cooperation and sharing research, development, and logistical support to health workers.

Unfortunately, we’re forfeiting that chance by missing no opportunity to pick fights with our allies and friends. The polling on expectations overseas and even in our hemisphere that we will “do the right thing” are terrible. We compete over supplies, and in Asia we are picking counterproductive fights with South Korea and Japan over cost-sharing.

We grew to unprecedented power after World War II by helping our allies and friends, in what used to be called the “free world,” become successful. Democracy grew around the world, most notably in Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, and other places. Now democracy declines across the globe, in large part because we’ve forgotten who we are.

If China emerges from the pandemic as an international leader, we have only ourselves to blame.

"['Emran Feroz Mohammad Zaman', 'Emran Feroz', 'Mohammad Zaman', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t stopped the war in Afghanistan,"The Taliban in Afghanistan signed a peace agreement with the United States on February 29 and stopped attacking American forces there.

But there’s no peace agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government — which means fighting between the two has continued unabated, even amid the coronavirus pandemic.

On March 20, Taliban fighters attacked an outpost in Zabul province and killed at least 24 Afghan soldiers, which caused outrage across the country. One day later, an Afghan government airstrike in Kunduz province killed 13 civilians, including 10 children. Two weeks ago, Afghan troops killed or wounded at least nine Taliban insurgents in Jawzjan province.

“This is wrong, and it needs to stop. Especially now,” said Dr. Sayed Shah, a medic from Afghanistan’s Baghlan province. Shah’s concerns are shared by many Afghans who are frustrated that the Taliban and the Afghan National Army are continuing to fight while the coronavirus spreads across the country.

As of April 15, Afghanistan has reported 784 Covid-19 cases and 26 deaths, but observers and medics on the ground believe the real number of infections could be much higher. A majority of the infected people are from Herat province, which shares a border with Iran, a country that has been hit heavily by the pandemic.

Overall, there is a shortage of coronavirus tests and ventilators in the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided Afghanistan 1,500 testing kits, yet only two laboratories in the country are equipped with machines that can process test samples. And according to the Ministry of Public Health, Afghanistan only has 300 ventilators — for the entire country.

International observers have urged both the Afghan government and the Taliban to immediately stop fighting and start working with the United Nations and aid agencies to improve access to health care to save as many lives as possible.

Unfortunately, it seems both parties are unwilling to cooperate. And they’re not the only ones: The Afghan government itself is divided, with two rival politicians both claiming to be the legitimate president of Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, the coronavirus continues to spread.

“A very toilsome procedure”

Every day, 50 to 100 patients visit Shah’s small medical office. “We try testing everyone who was in Herat or who used to have contact with people from there. We are also focusing on people with general symptoms,” Shah said.

He described how he and other medics were taking samples of suspected infected patients and sending them to the capital, Kabul. But — in part because of the ongoing fighting — that’s “a very toilsome procedure,” he told Vox.

The route to Kabul takes at least four hours just because of the distance, and includes passing through the mountainous Salang Pass with its decades-old roads. But often, even travel within Baghlan itself is virtually impossible because of the almost daily skirmishes between insurgents and security forces.

“Baghlan always used to be a violence hot spot, but these days it’s totally unbearable. They [soldiers and insurgents] should lay down their arms and work as health workers to save lives,” Mohammad Shahzad, a local merchant, told me.

On at least one occasion recently, power in the region was cut off due to clashes between Taliban fighters and Afghan soldiers in Baghlan. “They endanger the lives of patients. It was not just us who lost power. Large parts of the country were affected,” Shah said.

The Taliban denied that their operations caused the power outage and claimed instead that a power pole was damaged “because of weather circumstances.”

Attacks by government forces are escalating too. A recent airstrike killed two children in Baghlan’s Chashm-e Sher region and wounded several other civilians.

All of this is going on while physicians like Shah struggle to get the basic supplies they need to test and treat their patients. “I don’t have any tools to test anyone. Many local medics all over Afghanistan are in the same situation. We don’t have a simple laboratory for tests,” Shah said. “Let’s be realistic. We are not prepared for this crisis.”

To be fair, few if any countries were adequately prepared to deal with this pandemic. But Afghanistan’s political situation made it even less prepared than most.

The timing of the political chaos couldn’t be worse

Incumbent President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Abdullah Abdullah both declared themselves the winners of the country’s presidential election in October 2019, and both conducted separate inauguration ceremonies last month. Several politicians and strongmen are reportedly busy trying to resolve the differences between Ghani and Abdullah, but no official word has been released.

It’s not the first time this has happened: After the 2014 presidential elections, Abdullah disputed the results showing that Ghani had won and refused to concede. Fearing the collapse of the political system and the outbreak of violence, then-Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated a compromise: Ghani was declared president, while Abdullah was given the newly created position of CEO, a pro forma head of government position that does not actually exist in Afghanistan’s constitution.

But coming amid the coronavirus pandemic, the timing of the political chaos this time around couldn’t be worse. Rather than working together to prevent the spread of Covid-19, Ghani and Abdullah are vying for power, each trying to depict himself as the country’s savior, the one best prepared to lead the fight against the virus.

President Ghani and his cabinet members appear with masks and gloves from time to time and have stopped hugging each other when greeting. They also mentioned the virus in several speeches and statements and called on the people to take the disease seriously.

In reality, though, neither camp is succeeding in providing an adequate response to the crisis. Additionally, the US government said it was cutting $1 billion in aid to Afghanistan this year, and potentially another $1 billion in 2021, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to persuade Ghani and Abdullah in a meeting in Kabul in late March to support a unified government.

Meanwhile, the Taliban has started its own anti-coronavirus campaign. In Herat’s Shindand district, which is largely controlled by the insurgents, a Taliban Health Commission gathered “to raise public awareness” and “prevent the spread of the virus.”

“The spread of Covid-19 is an important issue for us. We have taken all measures to fight against it as strong as possible, and we also have a structured plan,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told Vox.

He said his group has already put several people under quarantine and that Taliban fighters are traveling to remote villages via motorcycles to distribute leaflets, soap bars, and hand sanitizer. “We are especially focusing on returnees from Iran and told them that they should start a self-quarantine,” Mujahid said.

With the country’s leadership bitterly divided and Afghan and Taliban forces continuing their bloody civil war, Afghanistan’s response to the pandemic has been dysfunctional, to say the least.

“The spiraling COVID-19 crisis puts millions of Afghans at risk, yet Afghan officials are consumed with infighting and the Taliban with adversarial posturing,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The two sides need to work together with the UN and humanitarian agencies to ensure that aid reaches the whole country, or a dire situation will become catastrophic.”

A few glimmers of hope that things may be improving

Two weeks ago, the Taliban declared they would uphold a ceasefire in areas under their control if they are hit by a coronavirus outbreak. The group also said they would guarantee the security of health and aid workers traveling to their areas offering assistance to prevent the spread of the virus.

And, after days of waiting, Herat has finally been put under quarantine by the government. Kabul is also facing a shutdown, and for the first time in years, many famous places like the Mandaii, the capital’s historic open-air market, are almost completely empty.

Still, many Afghans are not satisfied with the reaction from either side regarding the crisis and have decided to take things into their own hands.

Some well-known Afghan singers have composed songs about Covid-19 and shared them on social media. One of them, sung by famous singer Farhad Darya, was even used by local security forces to raise awareness.

In Afghanistan’s southeastern province of Khost, young activists are taking the fight against the spread of the virus seriously. “People, especially in remote areas, don’t know anything about the virus. They have not ever heard of corona. It would end in a catastrophe if they remain uninformed,” said Shah Mohammad Takal, a local activist.

In recent days, Takal and other activists have reached out to remote villages to try to inform people, many of whom are illiterate, about the dangers of Covid-19. They also printed leaflets with symbols to make the information as comprehensible as possible and spread them in villages and on the streets in the city.

These efforts seem to be having an effect, as measures have begun to ban overcrowding in public places in several provinces. In Khost, several hotels have already closed, and all types of meetings have been prohibited for the time being.

Public health officials are also trying to scan many travelers coming into the city by taking their temperatures or asking them questions about their health. Over the past several days, 8,000 masks, soap bars, and blankets have been distributed to the public in Khost.

Still, Takal said, “It’s just a matter of time until we record the first infection in Khost.”

“Western countries are struggling [to fight the virus], so you can imagine how difficult it is for Afghanistan,” Takal said. “But we try our best.”

"['Jen Kirby', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-15,"Trump announces halt to WHO funding, NYC revises death toll: Wednesday’s coronavirus news","President Donald Trump has announced he will stop US financial support for the World Health Organization (WHO) in the middle of a disease outbreak that is undeniably global: As of April 15, there have been more than 2 million confirmed cases and nearly 130,000 deaths worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker.

The Trump administration blames the international organization for favoring China and making the coronavirus pandemic worse, while the president is trying to sidestep criticism of his own response to the outbreak. Though questions have been raised about the WHO’s handling of the pandemic, Trump has come under fire for taking this action even as the entire planet tries to fight the coronavirus.

In the United States, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases has risen to more than 610,000. New York City, the epicenter of the US crisis, revised its death toll Tuesday to account for people who are presumed to have died at home from Covid-19 but were never tested. That revision led to nearly 4,000 more deaths being added to the total — and now, more than 10,000 people are said to have died of coronavirus in the city as of April 14.

On the economic front, there’s more grim news: US retailers reported the worst decline in sales in approximately three decades, showing just how much the coronavirus has upended the country’s economy.

Here’s what you need to know today.

Trump puts WHO funding on hold

President Donald Trump is halting US funding of the World Health Organization over what he claims are its failures in handling the coronavirus outbreak. On Tuesday, he accused the global health institution of “severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.”

Trump has also accused the WHO of pushing back on his decision to ban travel from China in January. That’s not exactly what happened, however: The WHO didn’t criticize the US directly. It instead issued a statement that appealed to countries not to take measures that might restrict international trade and travel.

According to the New York Times, the US provided more than $550 million of the WHO’s current $6 billion biennial budget, which means Trump pulling funds would be a huge blow to the organization that is trying to manage and coordinate the response to this global pandemic, among its other initiatives.

The World Health Organization has received its fair share of criticism during this pandemic, including whether it was too deferential to China at the start of the outbreak and whether it should have declared a global health emergency far earlier than it did.

Trump, who’s been amping up his criticism of the WHO for more than a week now, has made these critiques himself. But he also seems to be trying to pin the blame on the organization for the US’s own botched response. However, the president’s critics argue he deserves the blame for coronavirus failings in the US: Although Trump did close US borders to China, he failed to use that time to ramp up US testing capabilities or acquire medical supplies, forcing the US into lockdown to avoid overwhelming the health care system.

Public health experts and world leaders condemned Trump’s decision, arguing that a global pandemic is not the time to undercut the WHO. In a tweet, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that “halting funding for the World Health Organization ... is as dangerous as it sounds,” adding that “the world needs WHO more than ever.”

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the WHO must be supported, as it is “absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against COVID-19.”

The WHO does not have a perfect track record on the coronavirus outbreak, but it’s also only as strong as the more than 190 countries that belong to and invest in the organization. Rather than empowering the WHO to coordinate a global response, some countries, like the US, are instead turning inward. This could make it harder to bring the outbreak under control, as it’s going to take a massive international effort to stop the global spread.

New York City revises death count

As the coronavirus pandemic engulfed New York, the city began to witness another alarming trend: an increase in people dying at home. A spokesperson for the New York City medical examiner’s office told Gothamist on April 7 that about 200 residents were dying at home every day, compared to 20 to 25 a day before the coronavirus hit. Frequently, those individuals died without being tested for Covid-19, meaning they weren’t included in the city’s official death count, even if they were suspected of having been infected.

The city later said it would change this policy, which was expected to dramatically increase New York’s death toll — and it did. On Tuesday, the city added more than 3,700 deaths to its official count, all of whom are people suspected to have died of Covid-19 but did not test positive.

That brought the city’s death toll past 10,000 as of Tuesday. No other state or city in the US has even come close to that number. Adding suspected cases isn’t a perfect system, of course, but it may offer a clearer picture of coronavirus fatalities both in NYC and the country at large.

As ProPublica reported, New York City isn’t the only city with a spike in at-home deaths. Experts said such increases could stem from people who didn’t seek treatment (or who were told to stay home) and later died of coronavirus without ever getting tested. But the rise in at-home deaths may also be a larger consequence of an overwhelmed health care system: People are declining to seek care for other conditions, so they aren’t receiving the help that they might need.

US retailers have toughest month ever

The more economic data the US gets, the worse the situation seems to be. Retail sales declined in March by 8.7 percent, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, the largest-ever decline in retail spending since tracking began in 1992 and the worst month since fall 2008, during the Great Recession.

Basically, this means Americans aren’t buying things — not cars (auto dealers and car-parts stores lost 25.6 percent) or clothing (sales are down 50.5 percent). Consumer spending is critical to the US economy, but many Americans are under stay-at-home orders, have been laid off, or are fearful of losing their jobs — all of which means the ability, need, or even desire to go out and buy things isn’t there right now. Considering that a lot of the US’s most stringent lockdown measures didn’t go into effect until mid-March, the picture is expected to be even worse in April.

As Vox’s Matthew Yglesias explained, this is why simply reopening the economy — a strategy some of Trump’s advisers recommend — isn’t a quick fix, since it “doesn’t change the fact that people with falling incomes aren’t going to go make major purchases.”

The public health crisis is intimately linked to the economic one, but they’re not identical, and Congress and the Federal Reserve have many options to bolster the economy — like sending money to state governments and doing additional rounds of direct financial transfers to households — even as the country waits for an improved situation.

Time for some good news

As Vox’s Brian Resnick wrote in a beautiful story about plant resilience, “Life yearns for more.” Or, as Ian Malcom — Jeff Goldblum’s character in Jurassic Park — put it, “Life finds a way.”

With many stuck in quarantine, wildlife, at least, is finding a way, in places like Yosemite National Park in California — where coyotes, bears, and bobcats are making a comeback amid an absence of human tourists. Park officials said this often happens when the park is closed during government shutdowns, but the park has been closed since March 20 because of the coronavirus, and it may end up being the longest closure yet.

“The bear population has quadrupled,” Dane Peterson, who works in the park, told the Los Angeles Times. He said that while bears, bobcats, and coyotes are always around, they “usually hang back at the edges, or move in the shadows.”

This isn’t the only place where life has found a way; Venice saw clear canals and fish once the cruise ships and traffic stopped because of the coronavirus. Goats took over the Welsh town of Llandudno. Even the rats are taking over, which actually ... well, let’s draw the line somewhere. This is a bad thing. Plus, it might not actually be good for the rats.

But it’s nice to give the animal kingdom a bit of a vacation from humans. Maybe we should think about that a bit more, whenever we do head back out into the world. Except for the rats, though — I do not want to face the rat army that wins the “rat battle” for territory in the New York City subway system.

"['Zack Beauchamp', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-15,"Hungary’s “coronavirus coup,” explained","Two weeks ago, Hungary stunned the world. Using coronavirus as a pretext, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán pushed through a law that suspends elections and gives him the authority to rule by decree indefinitely — making him, at least temporarily, a dictator. A far-right firebrand exploiting a global catastrophe to seize near-unlimited control has obviously scary historical parallels; it’s the kind of power grab that got some citizens of Western democracies ruled by right-wing populists worrying about what their leaders might soon do under the circumstances.

In reality, Hungary has not been a democracy for years. But Orbán had cleverly maintained the veneer of a democracy — regular but deeply unfair elections, a formally free press that’s almost entirely controlled by the state, laws passed through a parliament where loyal members of his Fidesz Party control two-thirds of the seats — over what had become, in practice, a system where the opposition was permanently locked out of power while Orbán did what he pleased.

The new law, a so-called “coronavirus coup” enacted in the crisis atmosphere of a pandemic, strips off that veneer. It is an uncharacteristically crude measure, one that makes the more subtle reality of what’s happened to Hungarian democracy quite obvious. Yet even now, the full implications of what he’s been doing during the crisis are poorly understood.

In the two weeks since the law passed, Orbán has used the coronavirus response effort as a pretext to further weaken his political enemies. He has seized funding provided to opposing political parties for their campaigns and re-appropriated it in the name of stimulus. He has taken advantage of the loss in coronavirus advertising revenue to buy up one of the few remaining independent media outlets in Hungary.

The prime minister’s overt power grab is best thought of as a kind of clarifying moment: Rather than establishing a dictatorship anew, it exposes what Hungary had already become.

“Orbán didn’t need any empowerment, as he has a two-third majority in the parliament,” says Ákos Hadházy, a member of parliament from the opposition LMP faction. “The most important changes are not even about the law.”

There is a lesson to be learned here for the rest of the world. Orbán billed himself as one of the leaders of a new wave of right-wing populists, the “illiberal democracy” he was building in Hungary as a model for the rest of the Western world. He sees himself as a leading indicator, not a lagging one.

Hungary’s fate is a warning to the rest of the world. The coronavirus presents an opportunity for right-wing populists looking to solidify their hold on power and further undermine liberal democracy itself. The idea that there can be some populist “illiberal democracy” is a fiction — both in Hungary and in the United States.

Orbán’s power grab makes the subtext the text

The centerpiece of the new Hungarian law is fairly simple: It empowers Orbán to “suspend the enforcement of certain laws, depart from statutory regulations and implement additional extraordinary measures by decree,” as per a draft translation on the academic blog Hungarian Spectrum.

This means exactly what it sounds like it means: For the time being, Orbán is empowered to issue decrees that have the force of law. The law contains no binding constraints forcing the prime minister to issue decrees narrowly related to public health, nor does it ever expire.

According to the Hungarian constitution, any such emergency decrees should only last for a maximum of 15 days before they must be renewed by a majority in parliament. But Section 3 of the new law waives this requirement, giving automatic pre-approval to all of Orbán’s decrees. This means that, in practice, his dictates are in force indefinitely from the day he issues them.

In theory, the opposition parties in parliament could bring a case against the law to Hungary’s Constitutional Court. In practice, they’d be nearly certain to lose: A quantitative analysis by Hungarian researchers and human rights activists found that Orbán’s hand-picked justices on the court were overwhelmingly likely to rule in favor of his government on key issues.

“The Constitutional Court is an institution that has previously been packed with loyalists to the governing majority,” an Amnesty International report on Hungary’s courts from early April explains. “[It] has failed to resist direct or indirect political pressure in significant human rights related cases.”

The courts are also unlikely to intervene against the law’s other hair-raising provision: its provisions criminalizing free speech. If citizens “claim or spread a falsehood or claim or spread a distorted truth” that the government concludes is “obstructing or preventing” effective coronavirus response, they are committing a criminal offense that is “punishable by one to five years of prison.”

None of these terms have precise definitions in the law. It is entirely up to the government and its captive courts to determine what qualifies as a “distorted truth” that is in some way “obstructing” the Hungarian response to the coronavirus. Hungarian observers believe this law could be used to punish entirely accurate reporting and whistleblowing on the government’s manifest failures in responding to the coronavirus pandemic — including incredibly low testing rates and, in 2017, Orbán shutting down a dedicated task force of disease experts and epidemiologists.

“According to the bill, [individuals] will become punishable by law for publishing the ACTUAL FACT that they are crammed, against professional standards, in a shared quarantine with people who are likely to be infected for an examination — as long as this leads to an undermining of public confidence in the executors of such a measure,” Kristián Ungváry, a leading Hungarian historian, writes in the independent online outlet Index.

While there are some reports of individuals being arrested under these provisions, information on the provision’s use is still hazy. So far, journalists do not appear to have been targeted.

But the point of the law is not to arrest journalists. Rather, it is to force self-censorship — to make reporters and their sources so afraid of being jailed that they won’t report too critically on the government’s slow, inefficient response to the pandemic, or the problems created by its chronically underfunded health care system.

That’s why there have been a number of government-aligned media outlets calling for journalists to be investigated or arrested instead of being imprisoned outright. It’s why the Hungarian justice minister has made it clear that the law applies to journalists. And early reports in the international press suggest that it’s working — one Hungarian journalist told the Guardian that sources in the hospital system had stopped talking, citing the threat of imprisonment under the law.

“You’ll turn on the TV and you’ll see people calling for the arrests of reporters and editors,” Peter Erdelyi, a journalist at the Hungarian news outlet 444, told PRI. “I think that will have a chilling effect. Even if people don’t believe that they are going to get arrested, this will affect you.”

So long as these provisions are in power — the prime minister with unlimited and unchecked power, the press muzzled — it is impossible to deny that Hungary is anything but a one-man show.

“This is a very different order of magnitude than what we’ve seen before,” says Kim Lane Scheppele, an expert on Hungarian law at Princeton University. “It’s impossible to put a fig leaf over this being a dictatorship any longer.”

Hungary’s kayfabe democracy

The centerpiece of the government’s defense of the new law against charges like Scheppele’s is that the law is temporary. It will only last for as long as the coronavirus does; Hungary’s parliament, which is still considering legislation, can suspend it at any time.

“The parliament can lift the state of emergency — state of danger, as we call it — at any time,” Zoltán Kovács, a chief Orbán spokesman, writes in an official Q&A. “Furthermore, the state of danger applies specifically to the coronavirus epidemic. We all hope the epidemic will end soon, and with it so will the state of danger and these extraordinary measures.”

It is entirely possible, if not likely, that the state of emergency will formally end. Right now, the law helps the prime minister look strong in the face of the coronavirus situation — but it could eventually prove more trouble internationally than it’s worth domestically. Orbán often employs a tactic he’s described as “the dance of the peacock” — he does something incredibly provocative, then makes a show of retreating from it to quiet international criticism while more subtly retaining some of the underlying powers he grabbed in the first place.

In that sense, focusing too much on the indefinite formal authoritarianism could help Orbán get away with other abuses. It’s possible that Hungary’s parliament could end the state of emergency, formally take its power back, while still leaving some of the more subtle authoritarian power grabs Orbán has launched under this emergency in place — like defunding his political opponents and entrenching his control over the press.

To understand what’s happening here, you need to understand how power in Hungary actually works. Though Orbán’s Fidesz Party won less than 50 percent of the vote in Hungary’s 2018 election, it controls two-thirds of the seats in parliament thanks to extreme gerrymandering. That’s enough to amend the Hungarian constitution, meaning there are no real checks on the party’s power. Since Fidesz is entirely loyal to Orbán, he already has functionally unchecked power.

To maintain this level of control, Orbán and Fidesz employ a number of strategies to render national elections functionally non-competitive. One of the most devious ones involves taking near-total control of the media — using state regulatory powers to punish independent outlets, cutting off revenue from government advertising until they sell to the government itself or a private mogul loyal to Orbán. By 2017, according to a count by Budapest-based scholar Marius Dragomir, 90 percent of all media in Hungary was owned by either the state or a Fidesz ally.

There’s a term in professional wrestling — “kayfabe” — that describes the pantomime of truth in their events. While every match is staged, scripted in advance, the actors and producers work to portray them to their audience as “true.” Everyone knows it’s a stage performance with actors, more of a play than a sports competition, but no one admits it.

That’s what national elections in Hungary are like: functionally scripted performances that the people in charge insist are real. And during the coronavirus emergency, Orbán has worked to cement this form of social control in ways significantly more disturbing than even the country’s emergency law itself.

The most devious example of this relates to, of all things, stimulus funding. Like virtually every government around the world, the Hungarian government is proposing a stimulus bill during social distancing. The bill under proposal funds itself primarily by taking money away from Orbán’s political opponents.

Most egregiously, his government has taken away 50 percent of federal funding from all political parties to fund the coronavirus response. This might seem to affect all parties equally, but Fidesz has a variety of sources of campaign funding independent of state support. It’s the opposition parties that depend on government money. And the deck is getting even more stacked against them.

“While Fidesz, the governing party, has practically infinite resources, this will put a massive strain on opposition parties,” writes Hungarian journalist Szabolcs Panyi.

Last year, opposition parties won some impressive victories in local elections — seizing control of the municipal government in, among other places, the capital of Budapest (home to Hungary’s most anti-Orbán citizens). The stimulus proposal seizes control of a major source of funding for these cities and towns, a vehicle tax, and redirects it to funding the federal relief effort.

Not content to target Orbán’s political opponents, the Fidesz establishment is also exploiting the crisis in journalism ad revenue to consolidate its control over the press. At the end of March, Fidesz-aligned media magnate Miklós Vaszily purchased 50 percent of Indamedia — a company that controls advertising revenue for Index, one of the few remaining significant independent outlets in Hungary.

Index is insisting it will stay independent, but Vaszily has a scary track record. A former head of state-run media, he took control of the website Origo in 2014 and converted it into Fidesz propaganda. There’s real concern he’ll do the same for Index.

“Index will not close ... pro-government media will probably overtake it,” Ágnes Urbán, of the Mérték Média Monitor watchdog in Hungary, told Reuters.

The emergency law is a show of force. But Orbán’s authoritarian rule has far deeper sources than one law. Its repeal will not restore Hungarian democracy — and, in fact, could end up masking the ways in which he’s exploiting the crisis to make Hungary’s national elections even more of a kayfabe performance than they already are.

“Orbán needed this law to show he is a strong leader and able to hand the crisis alone,” Hadházy, the opposition lawmaker, tells me. “It is much more frightening that the Fidesz and the government have completely switched to campaign mode. They don’t care about the epidemic — they started the next election campaign.”

The coronavirus crisis is an opportunity for global right-wing populism

What’s truly remarkable about Orbán is that, despite all of this, he still has defenders in the West.

National Review ran a piece defending Orbán against charges of dictatorship by John O’Sullivan, the head of the Danube Institute, a Budapest-based think tank that’s indirectly funded by the Hungarian government. The American Conservative’s Rod Dreher, who describes himself as “an admirer of many of the things Viktor Orbán has done,” literally embedded government propaganda in a piece concluding that the emergency law was “basically fine.”

Such Orbán fans admire the Hungarian strongman for his strident opposition to immigration and his profound cultural conservatism, causes on which he’s doubled down during the pandemic. For example, the Hungarian parliament is currently considering a bill that would legally fix an individual’s gender as the sex they were assigned at birth — erasing transgender people from existence.

Such an approach has made Orbán popular among various types of “post-liberals” in the West, conservative commentators and intellectuals who reject liberal ideas of equality and tolerance in favor of a religiously informed, politically empowered vision of politics. This view got a prominent airing the same week as Orbán’s power grab, when post-liberal Harvard professor Adrian Vermeule argued for an “illiberal legalism” based on “a candid willingness to ‘legislate morality’” in the pages of the Atlantic. The allusion to Orbán’s term for his own vision of politics, “illiberal democracy,” is unmistakable.

In a certain sense, then, Orbán’s coronavirus power grab has done us an enormous favor. It has exposed that post-liberalism, which typically claims to be a new and more authentic species of democracy, collapses into authoritarianism in practice. Actual existing illiberal political movements reject core commitments to the toleration of political dissent, an assertion in the confidence of one’s own moral vision that allows the stamping-out of everyone else’s.

Hungary is not the only country where right-leaning illiberal populists have exploited the situation to their political advantage. In Poland, a ruling party often compared to Orbán’s has refused to postpone a May election despite a ban on public campaigning — shutting down the opposition’s ability to compete with a government that controls the airwaves.

Here in the United States, President Trump purged government watchdogs that might draw attention to his abuse of stimulus funding and conduct general oversight of his administration. He has launched a full-scale PR attack on the press, refusing to answer legitimate questions at briefings.

He has used his official spokespeople and friendly media outlets to rewrite the history of his response, spinning a terribly slow failure as an example of decisive leadership. He has seemingly turned the distribution of medical supplies into a form of political patronage and blustered about how the president has “total authority” to respond to the virus.

The fantasy of some kind of illiberal democracy was always just that: a fig leaf for authoritarian political movements that wished to bend the state to their will, one that some credulous observers are willing to accept purely out of culture war spite. The rest of us should not be so naïve.

"['Sigal Samuel', 'Apr']",2020-04-15,The coronavirus likely came from China’s wet markets. They’re reopening anyway.,"Scientists who specialize in emerging infectious diseases think one possible place the novel coronavirus may have jumped from animals to humans was at one of China’s wet markets, places where live animals are often slaughtered and sold for human consumption — including, in some cases, wildlife like bats and pangolins.

After the outbreak of the Covid-19 disease, China temporarily closed down the wet markets. In February, it also banned the sale of wildlife for consumption, making it illegal to sell wild animals (but not common live animals such as chickens or fish) as food.

Now, the country is reopening some of its wet markets — even as the global uproar over them is reaching a crescendo. Although the ban on selling wildlife remains in effect at the markets, the move is still controversial, and a growing chorus of experts is calling for a permanent ban on the markets in China and beyond.

“I think we should shut down those things right away,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of wet markets in an April 3 television interview. “It boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human-animal interface, that we don’t just shut it down.”

The United Nations’ biodiversity chief, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, shared that perspective. In fact, she appeared to want to ban the sale of all live animals, not just wild ones. “It would be good to ban the live animal markets,” she said in an April 6 interview with the Guardian. “The message we are getting is if we don’t take care of nature, it will take care of us.”

A bipartisan group of more than 60 US lawmakers also called for a ban on wet markets in an April 8 letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health, and the UN. “Market vendors cage animals of different species in close proximity, where the animals are likely to urinate, defecate, and potentially bleed or salivate on the animals below them,” the lawmakers wrote, explaining why the markets create the perfect conditions for pathogens to jump between animal species and then to humans.

Meanwhile, a new survey conducted by GlobeScan for the World Wildlife Fund asked 5,000 participants from Hong Kong, Japan, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam what they think about markets that sell wildlife (as some, but not all, wet markets do). It found that 93 percent of respondents were likely to support action by their governments to eliminate illegal and unregulated wildlife markets. And 84 percent said they were unlikely or very unlikely to buy wildlife products in the future.

But the campaign to shut down these markets is more complicated than it seems. Part of the problem is one of definition. China has some open-air markets that sell only slaughtered animals and produce; some that sell commonly eaten live animals like chickens; and some that sell wild animals like bats.

Many people conflate all these under the heading “wet market.” But there are gradations here, and they represent different levels of risk for zoonotic diseases (those transmitted from animals to humans). There is some zoonotic risk anytime live animals are kept in close quarters, but the danger may be especially pronounced with wild animals; their pathogens are ones to which we haven’t had the chance to develop immunity.

Another issue is that there are socioeconomic as well as cultural factors to consider. Some experts caution that millions of low-income people would lose access to cheap sources of food, and many farmers would lose out on needed income, in the case of an all-out ban on wet markets.

These nuances are crucial to understanding why a permanent ban keeps proving elusive, even though a Chinese wet market carrying live animals was also linked to the 2003 SARS outbreak, and even though we all desperately want to prevent future pandemics.

China’s wet markets, explained

Let’s get two things straight up front. First, wet markets aren’t unique to China. They’re common in many parts of the world, including several Asian, African, and Latin American countries. But because the coronavirus originated in China, we’ll focus on the markets there.

Second, wet markets and wildlife markets aren’t synonymous, though they’re often used interchangeably. This semantic slippage is actually driving a lot of the confusion in the debate about whether to ban all wet markets.

One recent study offered this very clear definition of wet markets: “A typical wet market is a partially open commercial complex with vending stalls organized in rows; they often have slippery floors and narrow aisles along which independent vendors primarily sell ‘wet’ items such as meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables, and fruits.”

Note that there’s nothing about wildlife in this definition. That’s because a wet market doesn’t necessarily include “exotic” wild animals. According to Christos Lynteris and Lyle Fearnley, two anthropologists who study disease in China, the disproportionate focus on “exotic” food consumption is often tinged with Orientalism and anti-Chinese sentiment:

In Western media, “wet markets” are portrayed as emblems of Chinese otherness: chaotic versions of oriental bazaars, lawless areas where animals that should not be eaten are sold as food, and where what should not be mingled comes together (seafood and poultry, serpents and cattle). This fuels Sinophobia. In reality, most seafood, live animal and wholesale markets in China contain far less exotic fare. An enormous variety of different kinds of market are confusingly lumped within the term “wet market,” a term that originated in Hong Kong and Singapore English to distinguish markets selling fresh meat and produce from “dry” markets selling packaged and durable goods such as textiles.

Among today’s wet markets, you’ll find some that sell no live animals whatsoever, just slaughtered animals and produce; some that carry common live animals like chickens or fish; and some that sell wildlife like bats and snakes.

While US lawmakers and other public figures talk about wanting to ban wet markets writ large, what they seem to really want to ban is the sale of wild animals — or perhaps any live animals — that sometimes occurs there. (Presumably they would have no problem with the wet markets that carry only slaughtered meat and produce; after all, the US is full of such markets.)

But in China, the wet markets are culturally treasured places, and not only because they are sources of affordable fresh food. For some, they also recall a vibrant and natural way of life, one that can’t be found in modern supermarket chains. Here’s how one man explained his love of the markets in a study:

Strolling at wet markets is my way of relaxation after exhausted workdays. I like wet markets because it has Yanhuoqi ... a sense of being alive. You cannot escape from the strong feeling of yanhuoqi in wet markets because you are always surrounded by diverse, vibrant foods, throngs of shoppers, and the loud voices of talking and vendor hawking. Everything comes alive in the market. Sitting in the office, I have no sense of season. The seasonal, colorful, fresh food in wet markets tell me the season.

Another man in the same study said he values the trust between food vendors and consumers, which gives him the sense of belonging to a community and assures him of the food’s freshness:

I have purchased pork nearly every day from the same pork vendor. We are acquaintances. He greets me every morning. He is very trustworthy. I know that he chose pigs from small farms in the nearby countryside. His pork is much fresher, more tender, and moister than the others.

Bearing in mind this culinary culture and how it helps people feel connected to their food sources and each other, the question is: Would an all-out ban on China’s wet markets make any more sense than an all-out ban on America’s farmers markets?

The problem with a total ban on wet markets

Experts disagree about exactly how far a ban should extend. Some say we need to ban just the sale of wild animals, while others say we need to ban all live animals from being slaughtered and sold in close quarters. But experts tend to agree that any responsible course of action will be more complex than simply banning wet markets altogether.

Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and a leading scholar on Asian animal welfare, said wet markets in China are a lot like farmers markets in the US, but with one difference: Far more people get their food from wet markets.

“The food markets are open again, as they are part of life there. It is not possible to close down all the food markets,” Cao said. But she added that China can and should permanently ban stalls selling wildlife within the markets. She said she’d ideally also like to see a ban on all live animals there, since commonly eaten animals like chickens can also spread disease, but conceded that this “may be difficult in rural areas at the moment.”

Lynteris and Fearnley, the anthropologists, likewise argued that a permanent shutdown would do more harm than good, at least in China:

It would deprive Chinese consumers of a food sector that accounts for 30-59 percent of their food supplies. Due to the large number of farmers, traders, and consumers involved, the abolition of “wet markets” is also likely to lead to an explosion of an uncontrollable black market, as it did when such a ban was attempted in 2003, in response to SARS, as well as in 2013-14, in response to avian influenza H7N9. This would involve enormously greater risk to public and global health than the legal and regulated live animal markets in China today. … What “wet markets” in China require is more scientific and evidence-based regulation, rather than being abolished and driven underground.

Although Mrema, the UN’s biodiversity chief, said “it would be good to ban the live animal markets,” she also warned it would need to be done delicately: “You have communities, particularly from low-income rural areas, particularly in Africa, which are dependent on wild animals to sustain the livelihoods of millions of people. So unless we get alternatives for these communities, there might be a danger of opening up illegal trade in wild animals which currently is already leading us to the brink of extinction for some species.”

It was out of economic necessity that some Chinese farmers began to breed wild animals in recent decades. As they struggled to live off the land, they discovered that they could supplement their income by turning to niche markets.

Experts tend to agree that any responsible course of action will be more complex than simply banning wet markets altogether

But Peter Li, an associate professor of East Asian politics at the University of Houston-Downtown, said it would be possible to safeguard people’s income security while banning the sale of wildlife in Chinese wet markets.

“People who work in the wildlife industry represent a small percentage of China’s enormous labor force. And the majority of people working in wildlife trade also do something else,” Li said, adding that traders who are negatively affected by a ban should be given financial subsidies to ease the transition to other kinds of work. “When people stop working in these markets, they should get some help from the government.” That could make a surge in illegal trade less likely.

The role of wildlife in Chinese traditional medicine

“While China has banned the trade and consumption of wild animals in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak,” notes the US lawmakers’ letter to the WHO and the UN, “there are significant loopholes relating to the current legal trade of wildlife for medicinal purposes.”

The lawmakers’ letter sounds a note of frustration about the fact that the Chinese government has exempted wildlife for traditional medicine from its ban. It’s easy to understand their annoyance. China adopted a similar approach after the 2003 SARS outbreak but eased restrictions once the outbreak was under control; 17 years later, things are right back where they started, but this time with a disease that’s killing even more people.

In recent years, wildlife products — like the scales of the endangered pangolin — have become popular among a small (but rich and powerful) minority in China. Breeders have hyped the products’ supposed health benefits, citing ancient Chinese texts that say they make people more robust, virile, and free of disease.

Cao called these “bogus claims of medicinal or healing or nutritional benefit without scientific basis.” She said the sale of wild animals for this purpose should absolutely be stopped.

Related Our environmental practices make pandemics like the coronavirus more likely

Li emphasized that Westerners shouldn’t be fooled into thinking that Chinese consumers must be allowed access to wildlife products because it’s part of their ancient culture. While there are classic Chinese texts extolling the healing properties of certain wildlife products, it’s not as though millions of people have been reading these texts and clamoring for such products of their own accord.

Instead, “the demand for wildlife products has been created by the industry for commercial purposes, for profit. Traditional Chinese medicine has been used,” Li said. “I have never seen a document by Chinese consumers telling the government, ‘Please, farm tigers!’ But I have seen documents by wildlife breeders telling the government, ‘Let us farm these animals so we can sell these products.’”

Will China keep its ban on wildlife sales?

The sale of wildlife in wet markets creates a serious risk of pandemics because it forces together animal species that would not encounter each other under ordinary circumstances, and then puts human beings in contact with these animals’ pathogens, to which we haven’t had the chance to develop any immunity. Many experts and even wet market aficionados now agree that the risk to human health is just too great.

In theory, it should be possible for China to permanently ban the sale of wildlife in wet markets without endangering many people’s food security, income security, and valued culinary culture by banning wet markets altogether.

But that would require the government to stop kowtowing to the wildlife farming industry, which has immense lobbying power, Li said.

For now, China is still banning sales of wildlife, with the exception of sales for medicinal purposes. What remains to be seen is whether, as in the case of the SARS outbreak, the government will lift this restriction after the world gets Covid-19 under control — or whether it will finally learn its lesson.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,How President Emmanuel Macron bungled France’s coronavirus response,"If any country should have been able to handle a coronavirus outbreak, you’d think it would have been France. One of Europe’s most powerful countries, France has a world-renowned health care system, immense wealth, ample social welfare, a centralized government, and a strong presidency.

Yet the country currently has the fourth-highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases and third-most deaths in the world. The country’s health care system is consistently ranked among the best in the world, yet France has experienced shortages of hospital beds, masks, and other critical products. As the number of confirmed cases and deaths continues to rise, popular food markets have been turned into makeshift morgues and high-speed trains have become Covid-19 patient transport vehicles.

Much of the blame lies at the feet of French President Emmanuel Macron’s government, whose slow response and critical missteps in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak set the stage for France’s current crisis.

On Monday, Macron basically admitted as much. “Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,” he said in a televised national address in which he announced an extension of the nation’s lockdown to May 11.

“This moment, let’s be honest, has revealed cracks, shortages,” Macron said. “Like every country in the world, we have lacked gloves, hand gel, we haven’t been able to give out as many masks as we wanted to our health professionals.”

But for the nearly 15,000 people who have died in the country from Covid-19 so far, Macron’s realization came far too late.

“We were not worried enough” early on, Pierre-Yves Böelle, an epidemiology expert at the Sorbonne University in Paris, told me.

The coronavirus “time bomb” Macron missed

On January 24, France’s then-Health Minister Agnès Buzyn announced that two people in the country tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the first known cases in all of Europe. They had just been to China, Buzyn said, adding, “We will probably have other cases.”

But if Macron’s government felt a sense of urgency, it didn’t show it.

February came and went with little action. Health officials advised citizens to wash their hands, keep a safe distance from others, cover their mouths when sneezing, and stay away from retirement homes. And Macron held video conference calls on the virus and inspected hospitals and clinics to see how his country was coping.

Yet few concrete actions were taken to impose strict social distancing measures or promote large-scale testing.

And Macron didn’t even follow his own government’s advice: During a late February trip to Naples, Italy, he and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took a stroll through the city, swarmed by press and onlookers, with whom Macron chatted and shook hands. Macron also kissed Conte multiple times during the visit.

It wasn’t until March 3 that France took real action. The government shuttered 120 schools in two regions, one of them an area north of Paris, as they had become among the hardest-hit areas in the country.

But even as tens of thousands of students were told to stay home, Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer tried to downplay the move. “It wouldn’t make sense to confine everyone at home, to paralyze the country,” he told a local television station.

Indeed, the government still allowed gatherings of up to 1,000 people to proceed. Macron, for his part, attended a theater performance on March 6, partly to show that life could continue unperturbed. He also visited a retirement home that same day, even as the number of coronavirus infections in the country was at least doubling.

To make matters worse, France couldn’t get a clear picture of the growing problem due to a lack of tests.

As Politico reports, the country doesn’t manufacture its own testing kits, but rather “relies on China for their main components.” With China paralyzed by its coronavirus outbreak at the time, France was unable to quickly get more tests. That severely limited the country’s ability to do widespread testing early on, which public health experts say is critical to slowing an outbreak.

The problem was compounded by a dearth of masks, leading the government to say only medical workers should wear them, not the general public. It turns out that, as France’s new Health Minister Olivier Véran (who took over in February after Buzyn abruptly resigned to run for mayor of Paris), told Parliament on March 19, France’s strategic supply of personal protective equipment wasn’t as robust as everyone had thought.

“It was decided in 2011 and 2013 that there was no longer a need to keep massive stocks of masks, considering that factories could deliver quite quickly, namely in China,” Véran said, according to Politico.

Macron, in effect, was sleepwalking toward disaster. Two events finally woke him from his slumber, experts say.

The first was Italy’s coronavirus situation. In late February, Italy had just three confirmed cases; by mid-March, that number had skyrocketed to around 15,000. That got Macron’s attention and caused him and his leadership team to worry that perhaps the disease was worse than China had let on.

The second was the discovery of some 2,500 coronavirus cases in the country that could all be traced back to a single week-long religious gathering that had taken place in mid-February.

As Reuters reports, during the week of February 17, hundreds of worshippers from around the world attended an annual celebration at the Christian Open Door evangelical megachurch in Mulhouse, a city in eastern France near the country’s borders with Germany and Luxembourg.

One of the congregants carried the disease.

At the time, though, the French government had yet to ban large gatherings. “There was no alcohol gel for the congregations to clean their hands, no elbow bumps instead of handshakes,” according to Reuters.

The first case linked to the church was identified on February 29. Over the following weeks, experts traced some 2,500 infections back to the event. “Worshippers at the church [had] unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe’s biggest automakers,” Reuters reports.

By the time researchers understood the extent of the outbreak, they knew bigger problems lay ahead. “We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us,” Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France’s national public health agency, told Reuters in March.

Macron was pressured into holding elections during the coronavirus outbreak

The French government tried to make up for lost time.

On March 12, Macron announced all schools, nurseries, and universities closed to keep the spread of the virus to a minimum. Two days later, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said all nonessential businesses such as restaurants, movie theaters, and night clubs would be shuttered, while shops like supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open. “We must absolutely limit movement, meetings, and contacts,” he said at the time.

But as Macron struggled to respond to the growing epidemic in his country, he also had to contend with a brewing political crisis.

The government had decided to hold the long-scheduled first round of mayoral elections on March 15 in the country’s 35,000 towns and villages. Per Macron, experts told him it’d be fine for the election to proceed as planned.

“We are following the recommendations of scientists,” Macron said after leaving his local polling station on voting day. “The virus spreads when we spend more than 15 minutes closer than one meter to someone, which is the case at the restaurant, but we can continue shopping for food and stepping out to get some air, and so it was logical to go vote while respecting guidelines.”

His political adversaries at the time pushed for that decision, as polling showed Macron’s party in fourth place and his personal popularity around 33 percent. The center-right party Les Républicains, for example, declared Macron would be leading a “coup d’état” if he postponed the election.

“They were under a lot of pressure from the opposition,” said Benjamin Haddad, who represented Macron’s party in Washington, DC, during the 2017 election. “In retrospect, you probably feel that it would’ve been better to postpone or suspend it, but it was a really tough call to make in a fraught time,” added Haddad, who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.

Macron’s party did horribly in the first round of elections, which saw record-low voter turnout. And the next day, on March 16, Macron announced that he was postponing the election’s second round and imposing a countrywide lockdown.

“I know what I am asking of you is unprecedented, but circumstances demand it,” the president said in a televised national address. “We’re not up against another army or another nation. But the enemy is right there: invisible, elusive, but it is making progress.”

“We are at war,” he said multiple times.

While some might think Macron shut down the electoral process because his party got trounced, Célia Belin, a France expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, told me all parties felt the coronavirus outbreak demanded a halt to the vote.

“By then, everyone was convinced,” she told me.

France’s health care system isn’t ready to deal with a crisis this big

France’s health care system is renowned as one of the world’s best. But Julia Lynch, an expert on that system at the University of Pennsylvania, told me that French leaders over the past 30 years have cut excess slack in health care because it was also one of Europe’s most expensive.

The goal was to make the system more efficient overall by providing the same level of service at lower cost. But, she said, “when you do that, you make [the system] unable to deal with large crises.”

Lynch said many hospitals in France, particularly in rural areas, have closed down over the past 20 years. That was also due to the funding cuts, which directed money away from hospitals and toward primary care physicians, who wield a lot of power in France. “There has been an overall reduction in [hospital] capacity preceding the Covid-19 epidemic,” she said. “Cuts made were precisely in the area where we now most need capacity.”

That’s become quite evident in recent weeks. Intensive care unit (ICU) space is at such a premium that patients are being transferred to Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland for treatment, sometimes transported on France’s high-speed TGV trains. The Rungis food market south of Paris is now serving as a morgue for the overflow of bodies. And there’s now a large field hospital outside Mulhouse, where the religious gathering took place.

The situation is so bad that physicians have criticized Macron to his face.

“When it was about saving Notre Dame, many were moved,” Dr. Francois Salachas told Macron during his visit in February to a Paris hospital, noting the cathedral had received massive funding pledges — approximately $1 billion — after it burned last year. “This time it’s about saving public hospitals, which are going up in smoke at the same speed as Notre Dame almost did.”

Macron has finally started to take serious action. Will it be enough?

Macron’s “war” against the coronavirus is now fully underway.

He launched “Operation Resilience,” which allows French military troops to provide logistical and medical support throughout the country. French armed forces are also authorized to use helicopters to reach French islands.

The government has also helped provide some 5,000 additional ICU beds around the country, and Macron’s team has proposed an aid package of 100 billion euros — about 4 percent of France’s GDP — to boost the economy.

The government also took strong measures to ensure no one traveled for the Easter weekend. Most visibly, around 160,000 law enforcement officials set up checkpoints on major roadways, ensuring the yearly grand départ for the holiday wouldn’t take place.

All of these efforts seem to be having an impact: The number of ICU cases in France is in decline, though the number of deaths still ticks upward.

But major challenges remain before Macron can declare a full turnaround.

First, the disease continues to impact retirement homes more than anywhere else in the country, especially in the hard-hit region of Alsace in the east. Nurses and directors of these homes believe many deaths they witness may be due to the coronavirus but won’t be counted as such by the government.

“The tsunami has entered the building, it’s a disaster,” Pierre Gouabault, who leads a home in the central Loire Valley, told France 24 this month. Gouabault said 10 people in his care recently died from the disease and nearly 20 others have worrying symptoms.

Second, Macron continues to make some questionable decisions. Last week, for instance, he traveled to Marseille to meet with Dr. Didier Raoult, a famous French microbiologist. Raoult constantly pushes the use of the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, just like President Donald Trump does.

But the evidence of those drugs’ effectiveness against the disease is incredibly flimsy, and health experts warn that rigorous clinical trials are needed before using the drug to treat Covid-19 widely.

Macron hasn’t touted the drugs himself, but critics contend that his taking time to visit Raoult only helps promote the doctor’s controversial stance on the drugs.

Finally, France’s political situation will continue to constrain Macron’s actions. Macron is up for reelection in two years, and though experts say he retains a slight edge in the country’s fractured political environment, he is fairly unpopular, and opponents on all sides question his every move.

That could lead him to make critical decisions like reopening the country based more on how they will impact his own political fortunes rather than how they’ll impact public health.

Still, experts say the best way forward for the president is to solve the crisis before it gets entirely out of hand. “If he stays the course, I don’t think he’s going to be that much weaker,” said Belin.

"['Jen Kirby', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,"States vs. Trump on economic reopening, France extends lockdown: Tuesday’s coronavirus news","The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide is nearing 2 million, as of April 14. The United States has registered more than 584,000 cases, and most states are approaching the one-month mark of lockdown measures being in place.

How much longer those shutdowns will last is an unanswerable question at this point, but some states are beginning to at least come up with plans for eventually easing restrictions. California, Oregon, and Washington are coordinating for their region, and a consortium of states along the East Coast, including Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, are also working together on a strategy to reopen their economies.

But President Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his desire to reopen the country as quickly as possible, is insisting that he has the “ultimate authority” in this matter and can order states to reopen their economies whenever he wants, regardless of what the governors have planned.

This is untrue (at least, according to a little thing called the US Constitution), and the administration still lacks a plan, or the tools, for how to actually reopen the economy, even if it wanted to.

To try to remedy that, the president is assembling a task force to come up with an economic strategy. Those experts, Reuters reports, are expected to include Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow, among others. Notably, that list does not yet include public health officials.

Governments around the world are struggling with whether and when to relax shutdown measures. France has extended its lockdown until mid-May. Austria has relaxed some of its restrictions, reopening small shops and parks. And even Italy, one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, has allowed bookstores and some other small stores to reopen.

This worldwide “Great Lockdown,” as the International Monetary Fund has dubbed it, is likely to cause the biggest global economic crisis since the Great Depression, the organization reiterated Tuesday. The group projects that global output will shrink 3 percent this year.

Here’s what you need to know today.

States are making plans to eventually reopen. Trump is tweeting about movies.

Most US states are still trying to slow the spread of the coronavirus, maintaining strict stay-at-home orders and keeping all but the most essential businesses closed. But as states begin to see the rate of infections and hospitalizations stabilize, calls to begin lifting restrictions and allowing economies to reopen are going to get louder and louder.

Right now, the federal government does not have a plan to reopen the country, though the Trump administration has floated the end of April as a possible target date for that. Which is why states are beginning to come up with their own plans, laying out regional roadmaps on how to slowly, maybe even haltingly, lift restrictions, reopen businesses, and protect the health of their residents.

California, Oregon, and Washington are forming something of a “western pact” to integrate their reopening plans. “COVID-19 has preyed upon our interconnectedness,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said in a joint statement Monday. “In the coming weeks, the West Coast will flip the script on COVID-19 — with our states acting in close coordination and collaboration to ensure the virus can never spread wildly in our communities.”

On the East Coast, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware are coming together to create a regional reopening plan for schools and businesses.

“If you do it wrong, it can backfire, and we’ve seen that with other places in the globe,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. “What the art form is going to be here is doing that smartly and doing that in a coordinated way.”

The details of these plans aren’t yet known, but leaders on both coasts have suggested any easing of restrictions would have to go hand in hand with more robust testing, including testing for antibodies to determine who has already been infected and potentially developed some degree of immunity. New York and its neighbors, like New Jersey, have been much harder hit by the coronavirus than the West Coast, though the country’s first outbreak began in Seattle.

Which is why governors, especially on the East Coast, are still urging caution and patience. “I still have an infection that’s growing,” Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont told CNN Tuesday morning. “This is no time to relax.”

As these states team up, President Donald Trump has claimed that he has the “ultimate authority” to reopen the economy, which is not true because of things like federalism. While Trump has issued federal social-distancing guidelines (“15 days” — then “30 days” — to slow the spread), these are just recommendations, and states ultimately ordered their businesses shut and nonessential workforces to stay at home. Some governors also resisted issuing stay-at-home directives.

Trump is convening a council to reopen the economy, but it is not expected to include any public health officials, according to the Associated Press. Public health experts within Trump’s own administration have warned that easing social distancing regulation too early could lead to a resurgence in cases. Trump on Monday said the council “will give us some also good advice but no, we want to be very, very safe. At the same time we’ve got to get our country open.”

State governors have pushed back against Trump’s assertion of ultimate authority, saying they will make their own decisions about when it’s safe to ease rules in their states. “If he ordered me to reopen in a way that would endanger the public health of the people of my state, I wouldn’t do it,” Cuomo said on CNN Tuesday. “And we would have a constitutional challenge between the state and the federal government and that would go into the courts.”

Trump is apparently not taking this resistance well. He tweeted Tuesday morning that Cuomo had been “calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the state’s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etc.,” but “now he seems to want Independence!”

“That won’t happen,” Trump wrote.

Less than an hour later, the president sent out a bizarre missive that referenced the movie Mutiny on the Bounty, seemingly accusing state governors of rising up against him. (Or something?)

The tweet does not include any mention about expanded testing or contact tracing — things that would help create the conditions needed to safely restart the economy — so it’s just Trump being Trump.

Tell the Democrat Governors that “Mutiny On The Bounty” was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2020

France extends its lockdown as other parts of Europe start to open

French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that he would extend France’s lockdown for another four weeks, until May 11, and then gradually reopen schools. Macron said pubs, restaurants, museums, and other venues might not be open until mid-July.

“I fully understand the effort I’m asking from you,” Macron said in a televised address. “When will we be able to return to a normal life? I would love to be able to answer you. But to be frank, I have to humbly tell you we don’t have definitive answers.”

France’s coronavirus crisis hasn’t gotten as much attention as Italy’s or Spain’s, but it’s right up there among the hardest-hit in Europe. The country has confirmed more than 137,000 coronavirus cases and recorded nearly 15,000 deaths as of April 14.

In recent days, though, the number of infections has slowed, a sign that the strict measures are helping stymie the virus’s transmission. “The epidemic is starting to slow down. The results are there,” Macron said.

Elsewhere in Europe, some countries are cautiously easing their restrictions. Spain allowed some businesses to reopen earlier this week. Austria, on Tuesday, also allowed some small shops, garden centers, and public parks to reopen. Though the Austrian government allowed these businesses to open, everyone must continue to abide by social distancing rules (only limited numbers of people in shops at once) and people must wear masks when in public. Fines will be issued to places or people that don’t follow the rules.

And even Italy, Europe’s coronavirus epicenter, is experiencing a slight relaxing of rules, with book shops and children’s clothing stores listed among the businesses now deemed essential and thus allowed to be open. Not every part of Italy has eased up on the total lockdown, though; in the north, where the outbreak devastated places like Lombardy, stores remain shut, according to the BBC.

The Great Depression, the Great Recession, and now: The “Great Lockdown”

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization that promotes the stability of the global monetary system, had already warned last week that the global economic fallout from the coronavirus would be the worst the world had seen since the Great Depression.

On Tuesday, the organization offered its projections for what it has begun calling the “Great Lockdown”: The global economy will shrink 3 percent in 2020, though it will rebound in 2021, the organization predicts. Advanced economies — including the US and many eurozone countries — could shrink as much as 6 percent. And that bounce-back next year depends on the course of the pandemic: how governments respond, and whether the world can collectively slow the spread.

“Countries urgently need to work together to slow the spread of the virus and to develop a vaccine and therapies to counter the disease,” the report said. “Until such medical interventions become available, no country is safe from the pandemic (including a recurrence after the initial wave subsides) as long as transmission occurs elsewhere.”

The big takeaway from all this is that this year is definitely going to bad, and the consensus is moving away from a rapid economic bounce-back and toward a more drawn-out economic recovery. As Vox’s Emily Stewart and Dylan Scott explain: “Too much structural damage has been done, jobs and businesses lost that will never come back. Supply chains have been broken and need to be rebuilt.”

And some good news

New York City has been deeply and profoundly affected by the coronavirus crisis. On Monday, the heavy rain and wind that battered much of the East Coast blew through the city. But when it cleared in the evening, many residents were treated to a truly gorgeous rainbow above the city.

Rainbows have become the symbol of hope during the coronavirus — people are posting them in their windows around the world for kids (and, let’s be real, adults too) to spot on their walks.

Monday evening’s real-life rainbow felt like a small sign of hope for a city in trauma.

"['Jen Kirby', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-13,"Sailor on USS Roosevelt dies, Spain eases some lockdown measures: Monday’s coronavirus news","The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has now exceeded 1.8 million. The United States makes up more than a quarter of those cases, with more than 558,000 confirmed infections.

The US reached the highest number of reported deaths in the world over the weekend, surpassing Italy (although Italy still has more deaths per capita). More than 22,000 people have died from coronavirus in the US as of April 13.

Among those is the first sailor from the USS Theodore Roosevelt — the aircraft carrier whose large coronavirus outbreak raised serious questions about the Navy’s handling of the crisis — to die of coronavirus-related complications.

Elsewhere in the world, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was released from the hospital after spending a week there, including a few days in the ICU. And Spain, which has seen its daily death toll and infection rate from coronavirus slow in recent days, is partially easing some of its lockdown restrictions in an attempt to help the economy.

Here’s what you need to know today.

Sailor from USS Theodore Roosevelt dies of coronavirus

The first sailor from the USS Theodore Roosevelt has died of complications related to the coronavirus. More than 580 sailors of the ship’s 4,800 crew members have tested positive for the coronavirus, but this is the first known death. The sailor’s identity has not been released.

According to the Navy, the sailor tested positive for Covid-19 on March 30 and was placed in isolation on a naval base in Guam. He was found unconscious on April 9 and hospitalized.

On March 30, Brett Crozier, the captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, wrote a letter to top Navy officials warning that the measures in place to protect his crew from the spread of the coronavirus were insufficient and pleading for help. The letter, which was unclassified, was quickly leaked to the press and was published by the San Fransisco Chronicle the next day.

Crozier was promptly removed from his post, with then-acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly saying Crozier had shown “poor judgment” in disseminating the letter too widely (he’d copied some 20 to 30 people on it, according to CNN) and had violated the chain of command.

Modly then delivered a speech to the Roosevelt’s 4,000 crew members in which he called Crozier “stupid” — and then that speech leaked. Modly handed in his resignation on Tuesday, which Secretary of Defense Mark Esper accepted.

The saga raised a lot of questions about the Navy’s handling of the coronavirus and the endangered crew members, as it looked as though they were trying to silence Crozier for having sounded the alarm. (Crozier himself tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this month.)

What’s more, it highlighted the dearth of permanent leadership at the top of the Navy, which hasn’t had a Senate-confirmed secretary since November.

More broadly, the Pentagon’s overall lack of transparency in its Covid-19 response has come under scrutiny, as Esper had previously directed commanders to stop publicly announcing Covid-19 cases, saying it threatened operational security.

Boris Johnson is out of the hospital, as the UK’s coronavirus crisis escalates

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was released from St. Thomas’s hospital in London on Sunday after spending a week in the facility because of his coronavirus symptoms. Johnson, who spent about three days total in the intensive care unit, was moved to a regular ward on Thursday and has now been discharged.

Johnson is now recovering at Chequers, the prime minister’s country estate in England. Right now, one of his cabinet ministers, Dominic Raab, is running things in his absence; a spokesperson for the prime minister said Monday that Johnson is recuperating and not doing any government work right now.

Johnson put out a video Sunday thanking the staff at the National Health Service, whom he later specifically thanked by name, for saving his life. “It’s hard to find the words to express my debt, but before I come to that I want to thank everyone in the entire UK for the effort and the sacrifice you have made, and are making,” Johnson said, referring to the country’s still-in-place lockdown measures.

It is hard to find the words to express my debt to the NHS for saving my life.

Johnson’s statement raised some concerns among reporters that the prime minister’s office had not been fully forthright about the seriousness of Johnson’s condition, but his office pushed back on those characterizations.

The UK is considering whether and for how long to extend its lockdown measures, which are currently in place but up for review. A decision is expected Thursday, and, as in the United States, there’s vigorous debate about whether the public health measures should be eased to try to rescue a floundering economy. The United Kingdom has confirmed nearly 90,000 cases of coronavirus as of April 13 and reported more than 11,000 coronavirus deaths.

Spain eases lockdown restrictions

Spain and Italy have been the two European countries hardest hit by the coronavirus so far. Spain has recorded 169,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as of April 13, with more than 17,400 deaths.

The country has been under stringent lockdown measures since March 15, with most businesses closed except essential shops like grocery stores and pharmacies, and people ordered to stay home unless they need food, medicine, or money; need to seek medical care or take care of a dependent; or are part of the workforce deemed essential. Spain later tightened those measures at the end of March, basically putting all nonessential work on pause.

But now the Spanish government is pulling back on those measures slightly in an attempt to ease some of the economic pressure from this expansive shutdown. Spain’s death rate appears to be slowing, as does the rate of new infections, offering an optimistic — if still uncertain — sign that the coronavirus might have reached its peak in the country.

As of Monday, workers in construction and manufacturing will be allowed to return to their jobs or reopen their businesses. Stay-at-home measures will remain in place for everyone else, though, and all other businesses, including bars and restaurants, are still closed through April 26.

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez warned that the country was “still far from victory, from the moment when we will recover normality in our lives.” He added that any moves to continue easing the lockdown would be done gradually.

And some good news

On Easter Sunday, Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli gave a performance from the Duomo di Milano, a famous cathedral in Milan. He performed alone, except for the organist who accompanied him. The performance was livestreamed, with 22 million viewers tuning in on Easter, according to the Washington Post.

Milan, the capital of Lombardy, is the epicenter of Italy’s coronavirus outbreak.",vox,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/13/21218950/coronavirus-updates-usa-sailor-spain-boris-johnson
"['Jen Kirby', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-11,The US is now the country with the most confirmed coronavirus deaths,"The death toll in the United States from the novel coronavirus has surpassed 20,000 meaning the country has overtaken Italy for the highest number of confirmed fatalities from the pandemic.

This grim milestone was expected, as the US recorded more than 2,000 deaths in a single day Friday. It was the highest number of deaths any country has recorded in 24 hours since the start of the outbreak.

Though the US now has the highest total death toll worldwide, Italy currently still has more deaths per capita. The global number of confirmed coronavirus cases is now greater than 1.7 million, and the number of deaths around the world topped 100,000 on April 11, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Officials had previously warned that the US should brace for a sharply rising death toll in what was likely to be its toughest week yet of the coronavirus pandemic. “This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly,” US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said last week on Fox News Sunday.

The magnitude of the crisis differs among states and localities. New York alone has more confirmed cases than any other country right now. The state registered more than 8.600 deaths as of April 11, including 783 in the past 24 hours. These figures are likely an undercount, as people were dying at home without having had a coronavirus test, and so haven’t previously made it into the official count.

New Jersey and Michigan are the two other US states with fatality numbers that exceed 1,000. Wyoming is the only state, so far, without any reported coronavirus deaths.

“This is the end of the week, that famous week that we spoke about last week, in what was predicted to happen, happened,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said Friday at a White House press briefing.

Has the United States reached its coronavirus peak?

At the end of March, the White House presented data that suggested between 100,000 and 200,000 people could die from the coronavirus. Though there have been some questions about the statistical models the administration used to make that estimate, Fauci said Thursday the estimates are now closer to 60,000 — in part because aggressive stay-at-home measures are working. That is still an astounding figure.

Though the US now leads the world in confirmed coronavirus fatalities, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said Friday the country had not yet reached the peak of the pandemic.

“We have not reached the peak,” Birx said. “Every day we have to continue to do what we did yesterday, and the week before, and the week before that, because that’s what in the end is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side.”

Different states are expected to peak at different times, and despite the startling death tolls, there are some glimmers of optimism. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that, on average, the state is seeing a decline in hospitalization and ICU admissions. Experts say there are signs the curve is beginning to flatten in other hard-hit places, such as Michigan.

Birx, and Fauci, emphasized that, despite some promising signs, maintaining social distancing measures remained imperative. “It’s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that, since we have made such important advances and success of the mitigation, that we need to be pulling back at all,” Fauci said Friday.

This, though, is going to be a likely source of tension as the US begins to get a handle on the pandemic. The extreme measures that are limiting the spread of the virus have brought the US economy to a near-standstill, with businesses shuttered and millions of workers unemployed. The number of jobless claims filed in the week ending April 4 reached 6.6 million; in the past three weeks combined the number of claims has exceeded 16 million.

A few weeks ago, President Donald Trump said he wanted to see packed churches for Easter, a vision he had to rescind once it became clear that, far from being back to normal, the country would be bracing for devastation if the administration did not extend its social distancing guidelines.

But Trump made that decision back when cases and deaths were increasing and increasing by the day; now, if the US begins to see signs that the virus is under control, pressure may intensify to try to ease restrictions and reopen segments of the economy. The Trump administration is reportedly pushing to reopen much of the country by May.

And that, public health experts warn, could quickly mean a resurgence of coronavirus cases if it happens too abruptly.

“If you ease up prematurely the epidemic can rebound right back to the level we are at now in a matter of weeks,” Chris Murphy, a researcher for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which has been modeling Covid-19 projections for the US, told NPR. “So the potential for rebound is enormous if we let up on social distancing.”

Of course, Trump doesn’t just have the power to simply re-open the economy. Those decisions will fall to states and localities, who will make their own determinations on when it’s safe to ease restrictions.

And this means, regardless of what recommendation the federal government chooses to make, reopening the country by May 1 is looking unlikely. Los Angeles County, for example, just extended its lockdown until at least May 15. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said an opening was possible in May or June, if New Yorkers “really work hard” and abide by social distancing. On Saturday, de Blasio said schools would be closed for the rest of the school year, though Cuomo, the governor, described it as an “opinion” and wanted to coordinate with other localities in metropolitan area.

Any initiatives to end current social distancing measures — even if they are rolled out in the summer — depend on having an aggressive plan to keep the number of infections low. Any such plan will almost certainly require widespread testing and contact-tracing (identifying those infected, and who they’ve come in contact with, so everyone can be quickly quarantined), two things the US does not yet have the capacity, or a clear plan, to implement on such a massive scale.

Update: This article has been updated with more current statistics, and to note that the US’s population is greater than Italy’s.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-10,3 European countries are about to lift their lockdowns,"Even as the coronavirus continues to rage across Europe, some countries in the region are considering loosening social distancing restrictions to regain a semblance of normalcy — and restart the economy.

But experts fear lifting those measures too early, or too quickly, could cause a surge of infections, deepening the region’s health crisis.

Austria plans to ease its lockdown next week; if it goes through with it, it will be the continent’s first nation to reopen its closed shops and restaurants. Denmark will open schools and day care centers on April 15, ending the country’s three-week-long halt. On April 9, the Czech Republic lifted a number of its social distancing measures, and plans to roll back its travel ban on April 14, allowing citizens to leave and foreigners to enter.

Earlier this week, Italy and Spain two of Europe’s hardest-hit countries, were also considering easing their lockdowns — before deciding a few days later that they’d need to extend them for at least a few more weeks.

“For each country, they’re trying to find that unique sweet spot, the perfect one where you can manage everything,” Arjen Boin, a crisis management expert at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, told me.

“It’s going to be one of the biggest challenges democratic governments have faced in a long time, finding that golden midway between a reemerging pandemic and killing your economy,” Boin said. “That’s going to require a lot of wisdom and exceptional leadership.”

Of course, countries need to open up sometime, and there’s never a perfect moment to do so. And what they learn from their decisions may offer lessons for the rest of the world.

“They’re engaging in an experiment,” said Martin McKee, an expert on European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “That may not be a bad thing, but like any experiment there are risks attached to them.”

The question now is if those risks outweigh the benefits — and no one really knows the answer.

European leaders are pursuing “a step-by-step resurrection”

Wearing a mask and standing behind plexiglass, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz addressed members of parliament on April 6 to present his plan for “a step-by-step resurrection” of the country’s economy.

Here’s that plan, according to the New York Times:

Small shops, hardware stores and garden centers will be allowed to reopen on April 14, followed by other businesses at the end of the month. Restaurants and services that involve close human contact, like gyms and hairdressers, might not get the green light until mid-May or June.

The Washington Post reports that Austria’s schools are also scheduled to resume normal business in the middle of May, though that decision will be reevaluated at the end of April. Finally, public events might once again be allowed in July.

But, Kurz warned lawmakers, “We are not out of the woods.”

In Denmark, the government is pursuing a similar gradual, incremental reopening. “It’s like walking a tightrope,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at a press conference on April 6. “If we stand still, we may fall. If we go too fast, it may soon go wrong. We don’t know when we’ll be on firm ground again.”

Denmark’s schools and daycare centers will reopen on April 15, though the New York Times notes that “that is subject to the number of infections stabilizing.” The Times says that “restaurants and borders will remain closed for now. The government has also banned large gatherings through August.”

The Czech government has proposed a modest rollback of its travel ban. For example, someone entering the country must be quarantined for two weeks. That stipulation will surely keep many away from visiting Prague any time soon. The government will also allow shops that sell hobby products and building material to open, as well as small-group outdoor sports like running and biking to continue.

For many, this seems like a turning point — but it’s not clear that this development is purely good news.

“You can’t just open up everything. That’s just completely crazy.”

All three of these countries were among the first in Europe to impose strict lockdown measures, so in some ways it makes sense that they’d be among the first to loosen those restrictions. Yet the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s McKee told me it may still be too early for these countries to start lifting social distancing restrictions.

If they are going to go forward with them, though, McKee said the slow-and-steady approach makes the most sense to him. “You can’t just open up everything. That’s just completely crazy,” he told me.

What’s clear from the experts I spoke to is that there is no magical “right time” to put a country back to work or a “right way” to do it. Even plans for the American response reviewed by Vox’s Ezra Klein show a variety of methods and timelines to quash the outbreak while building the economy back up, and none are satisfying.

McKee offered a set of criteria for when a country should consider loosening restrictions. First, the mortality curve must be coming down. Second, its disease transmission rate should be “R1” or less, meaning that, on average, one sick person is passing on the virus to just one other person. Third, the government must have a lot of accurate data, particularly on who’s infected and who they’ve been in contact with.

Until then, all countries should keep the same social distancing measures they have now, McKee said.

It’s not clear the European countries considering a change satisfy those criteria. A recent study found that Austria has more infected people than official government figures show. The official infection rate in the Czech Republic is slowing, but it’s still unclear just how widespread the disease is in the country.

And even though official statistics for the moment look better in Denmark, much of the population worries that it’s too early to send children back to school. “My child will not be a Covid19 guinea pig,” is the name of a 35,000-person strong Facebook group in the country.

So why take the risk? Much of the reason has to do with staving off an economic collapse. But another major reason, experts noted, is simple political concerns.

“The strategy we follow is a political choice”

Olga Löblová, a political scientist at the University of Cambridge who lives in Prague, explained why the government in the Czech Republic announced the end of travel restrictions. Partly, she said, it was a political decision.

“The reason why the government actually announced this intention and start easing the measures was to give people hope that this won’t go on forever,” she told me. “They have to start working on some kind of an exit strategy or at least some kind of vision to placate the opposition,” she continued, noting those out of power are losing their patience with the country’s lockdown.

The same is true elsewhere.

In Denmark, Prime Minister Frederiksen acknowledged last week that “the strategy we follow is a political choice.” In Austria, Kurz regained his leadership post after a scandal brought down his government last year, leading experts to say he’s sensitive about keeping the public on his side.

Even in countries that are continuing their lockdowns, there are signs that politics might soon change that calculus.

In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, weak after barely forming a minority government in January, said he would lift a ban on nonessential work after Easter — a decision experts believe is motivated by his precarious political situation. In Italy, leadership there said getting the economy roaring again was the only way the Europe Union could compete against China and the US.

In other words, the choices European leaders are making aren’t solely based on health concerns. They’re based on political ones. “All crises are political at heart,” the University of Leiden’s Boin told me. “Leaders are always aware of how their performance will be weighed by the people.”

Which partly explains why the warnings of top European health officials seem to be going unheeded.

“Now is not the time to relax measures,” the World Health Organization’s Europe director Hans Kluge said at a recent news conference. “It is the time to once again double and triple our collective efforts to drive toward suppression with the whole support of society.”

"['Constance Grady', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-02,The politics of the books we display behind us during video calls,"Welcome to Vox’s weekly book link roundup, a curated selection of the internet’s best writing on books and related subjects.

Bafflingly, although it took a thousand years for March to go by, April has slipped past me between eyeblinks. Still, plenty of people spent April writing about and thinking about books, so let’s go over the best of it from the last week of the cruelest month. Here is the internet’s best writing on books and related subjects for the week of April 26, 2020.

The New York Times is getting in on the “judge celebrities by their bookshelves” game. First, Gal Beckerman played the game, zooming in on the shelves sitting behind celebs from Cate Blanchett to Paul Rudd. Prince Charles’s bookshelves hold disconcertingly exactly what I would imagine him reading:

1. “Stubbs,” by Basil Taylor: A biography of the 18th-century English painter best known for his depictions of horses. 2. “Shattered,” by Dick Francis: From the master of the equine thriller, a novel of horse-racing and glassblowing. 3. “Kings in Grass Castles,” by Mary Durack: A 1959 Australian classic about the outback during the 19th century. He probably also owns the sequel: “Sons in the Saddle.”

And second, Amanda Hess critiqued the game, analyzing the rise of the “credibility bookshelf”:

The credibility bookcase, with its towering, idiosyncratic array of worn volumes, is itself an affectation. The expert could choose to speak in front of his art prints or his television or his blank white walls, but he chooses to be framed by his books. It is the most insidious of aesthetic trends: one that masquerades as pure intellectual exercise.

Finally, Tim McKeough shows you how to play the game yourself, talking to experts about the best way to organize your bookshelves:

But how much thought have you given to the way you store your books? Even if your collection seems like a mountainous, unruly mess, it can add appeal to your home — provided you display it well. Books “tell a story about who the homeowner is,” said Nina Freudenberger, the owner of the design firm Haus Interior in Los Angeles, and the author of “Bibliostyle: How We Live at Home with Books.” “Books tell us about what someone was interested in, what their passions are, what their beliefs are and what kind of person they hope to be,” Ms. Freudenberger said. “Homes without books have no soul.”

In the LA Times, Leslie Pariseau talks to the writers who have found themselves locked down inside artist residencies:

If you aren’t familiar with the residency model, it may sound like a cushy retreat in the woods or a beach vacation — creative summer camp for adults. At the most competitive residencies, room and board and sometimes modest stipends are included. Getting stuck there in a pandemic could be construed as the artists’ corollary to that now-infamous honeymooning couple stuck in the Maldives. But the reality is these retreats constitute a support system for artists and writers struggling to cobble together a livelihood. Most of this season’s — and likely next season’s — resident-hopefuls, who would otherwise be making travel plans, will not be going anywhere. And even those stranded at the tip of Massachusetts are unsure of where they’ll go next.

Rhyme is one of the first ways we are introduced to language. There is evidence to suggest that it helps with language acquisition and other semantic development, and studies have also observed a link between rhyme and our aesthetic enjoyment of poetry. But among some literary circles, there is a snobbery about its use. Sceptics deride the use of rhyme as an artistic crutch, believing that it stands in way of achieving deeper, loftier literary aspirations. A common target of their ire is the rhyming dictionary—a handy manual full of avenues that poets of all abilities can run down. But while they may scoff, the long history of rhyming dictionaries shows their curious role in making poetry accessible to the masses.

At Vice, Caroline Edwards tracks the rise of the dark academia aesthetic across TikTok:

The aesthetic is listening to Chopin on vinyl, while curled up with a book — likely by the Beats or Baudelaire — in dim candlelight, whilst sipping a cup of tea. It’s bringing a sketchbook to the museum and musing over ancient statues, drawing the furrowed brow and soft lips. It’s wearing turtlenecks with overpriced Barbour jackets and houndstooth trousers, complete with shiny Oxfords, to give the illusion of a brooding scholar who has an acceptance letter to Brown. Essentially, it’s living like a moody YA character who drinks whiskey while writing essays just because his favorite author did the same.

At the Cut, Matthew Schneier suggests that now is the perfect time to memorize a poem. I, because I was that kind of teenager, taught myself “Make me a willow cabin” in high school and can do it still, privately, inside my own head. It brings me joy, if no one else. Here’s how Schneier makes his case:

Poetry is sticky. Prose slips. Barbed and spurred, poems catch in your chest; they get stuck in your head like songs. Still, to admit to liking poetry is faintly embarrassing. The familiar stereotypes cling: The old stuff is out of touch; the new is pretentious, mawkish, or insincere. If you charm your beloved with poetry, you’re a troubadour, ridiculous; you might even be a cad. (Poetry can be used and abused. Robert Lowell chopped up his devastated ex-wife Elizabeth Hardwick’s letters and served them forth in his own poetry collection, The Dolphin.) “Poetry makes nothing happen,” W. H. Auden, one of our greatest poets, famously wrote. “I, too, dislike it,” added Marianne Moore in a poem called “Poetry.” But wait! “Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one / discovers that there is in / it after all, a place for the genuine.”

"['Aja Romano', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Watch: Lovecraft Country’s trailer teems with allegorical monsters,"HBO’s upcoming eight-episode horror series Lovecraft Country may not have been on your radar before now. Although it’s co-created by Jordan Peele and executive produced by Peele and J.J. Abrams, Lovecraft Country hasn’t really had a lot of mainstream attention.

But HBO just dropped the show’s debut trailer, which is full of eerie supernatural creatures, intriguing genre subversions, and lots of socially conscious horror — and it’s gotten our full attention.

Based on Matt Ruff’s fantastic 2016 horror novel, Lovecraft Country is set in the 1950s and follows a young black man named Atticus (Jonathan Majors) as he searches for his father (Michael K. Williams), who’s gone missing in the New England wilds that his family calls “Lovecraft country.” He and his pal Letitia (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) go on a road trip to search for him — but they quickly wind up confronting a host of eldritch abominations along the way.

That might sound like a straightforward plot, but it’s anything but. The trailer, with its looming references to racism, segregation, and police violence, gives us our first indication that many of the monsters in Lovecraft Country are actually human — a theme both Peele and Misha Green, the series’ co-creator and showrunner, like to play with.

The nomenclature here tells us even more about the complex literary legacies and sociocultural dynamics Lovecraft Country is dealing with: Atticus’s name saddles him with a complicated relationship to the flawed white savior of To Kill a Mockingbird, and to that book’s own fraught legacy as American culture’s premier fictional text on racism, as molded in a white worldview. The region of “Lovecraft country” is another callout to such a white worldview: It’s both a reference to H.P. Lovecraft, the writer, and a setting drawn from the fictional, rural New England that appears throughout Lovecraft’s many stories.

Lovecraft was the most influential horror fiction writer of the mid-20th century. He wrote weird fiction, a horror subgenre which teems with implied terror, usually intimated by brushes with unknowable, unnameable monsters and glimpses of vast cosmic worlds beyond ours through which giant, appalling gods sometimes pass.

But Lovecraft’s writing itself also was monstrous — monstrously racist. Lovecraft was a blatant, loud white supremacist. And despite its wild popularity, the Lovecraftian universe was constructed on an allegorical terror of the mixing of the races. Miscegenation, or interracial marriage and blending, comes up again and again in his works as a shortcut to demonic horror, madness, or both.

So it’s no wonder that in 2015, the World Fantasy Awards for fiction finally took the overdue but highly controversial step of distancing itself from Lovecraft’s legacy by discontinuing its use of a Lovecraft bust as an award trophy. Ruff’s novel was published one year later, and it marked one of the first mainstream attempts to wrestle with Lovecraft’s legacy in novel form.

Lovecraft Country foregrounds a group of savvy genre-fiction fans who also happen to be black, and allows them to grapple with Lovecraft’s racism as an allegory for American racism itself. But it also doesn’t stint on scenes of actual racism; the novel’s bleakest horror comes not from Lovecraft’s most famous monster, Cthulhu, but from the sheer terror of very real American horrors, like police brutality, Jim Crow laws, and sunset towns.

Jordan Peele fans already know he loves this kind of allegorical horror, and there’s a lot of it going on in the trailer. But fear not, horror fans — we also get plenty of monsters and badass monster-fighting, too:

Also #LovecraftCountry ... what you doing? Lol whew this is going to be good. pic.twitter.com/qlev6OQfWV — Zalika U. Ibaorimi, MA (The Final Girl) (@ZalUIbaorimi) May 1, 2020

Lovecraft Country premieres in August on HBO.

"['Vox Staff', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-08,"Vox’s audience support program, explained","Vox is launching a program to help keep our explainers and every facet of our journalism free during a time when everyone needs and deserves access to the most important information of the day. Thank you to those of you who have asked for a way to financially support Vox’s journalism. Our mission — to empower our audience through understanding — has never been more clear, and we are so honored that you want to play an important role in it.

Of course, we couldn’t launch this new initiative without first … explaining it. So here’s everything you need to know about Vox’s new contribution program.

Why launch this contribution program now?

Vox began reporting on this pandemic on January 6, and since then, the demand for our explanatory journalism has grown every day. Audiences are finding our style of breaking down complicated information into clear, concise explainers essential to understanding this evolving story.

On March 10, before social distancing was as widely enforced across the US, Vox published a piece that exemplifies our expertise in taking scientific information and formatting it in a way that is accessible and clear. How canceled events and self-quarantines save lives, in one chart has now been viewed more than 9.4 million times (two posts from former President Barack Obama didn’t hurt). Our subsequent video on the same topic has been viewed more than 6.2 million times on YouTube and translated by our audience into more than 75 languages; both the Italian state police and the Department of Health in the Philippines made their own version of the video to inform their public.

It’s clear to us, and millions of you, that this work is important. We want to keep providing you with free articles, videos, and podcasts at the quality and volume that this moment requires.

Doesn’t Vox make more money when more people read, watch, and listen to it?

It’s true, more people are turning to Vox right now than at any other time in our six-year existence.

Vox provides all of its content free — and we are committed to keeping it that way. Vox Media has a very diversified business, but without a subscription product or a paywall at Vox, advertising is still a major revenue source for our network.

But while the economic crisis continues, advertising dollars will shrink as the public need for our service grows. That’s why we are turning to you, our loyal audience, for support.

How will contributions be used?

Your support will enable our staff to offer free articles, videos, and podcasts where we’ll continue to cover the ins and outs of this crisis. Here are a few examples of what your contribution could help us do:

Continue to produce science explainers that clarify this moment and enable you to keep yourself and your family safe. So much is still being discovered about this virus and how it impacts people. And whether it is an explainer on how the virus spreads, what symptoms to look for, why testing has lagged, how soap works, or how to safely social distance, we will be here for you with key information you need now.

"['Shirin Ghaffary', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,"The May Day strike from Amazon, Instacart, and Target workers didn’t stop business. It was still a success.","Essential workers at major companies like Amazon, Instacart, and Target across the United States on Friday protested for better safety protections, working conditions, and pay during the coronavirus pandemic. The event attracted considerable media attention and political support, pushing companies to respond to the basic demands workers have been asking for since the beginning of the disease’s spread in the US and signaling that these workers have a sympathetic ear in the broader public.

By some measures, the protests — along with a recent series of walkouts or “sickouts” at Amazon’s warehouses and a general strike at Instacart — could be seen as underwhelming. Participation hasn’t been enough to shut down warehouses or, according to companies, slow down overall business. Both Amazon and Instacart have said they’ve seen record sales during the pandemic, and despite labor actions, there seem to be no signs that growth is slowing down.

“While there is tremendous media coverage of today’s protests, we see no measurable impact on operations,” wrote Rachael Lighty, an Amazon spokesperson, in a statement to Recode, which also stated that the company is committed to worker safety has spent $800 million on additional worker safety measures since the pandemic hit. Target and Instacart also sent statements saying that the companies are committed to worker safety; a spokesperson for Target said the company is aware of fewer than 10 Target workers who attended protests.

But regardless of scale, the protests were historic and, to a degree, effective. For the first time, organizers brought together a coalition of low-paid, non-unionized, often temporary employees from some of the largest companies in the US. They gained the backing of major political leaders like Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who tweeted in support of workers. And more importantly, their protests drew significant media coverage and public support at a time when the customers are more grateful and sympathetic than ever to the workers essential in keeping them supplied with food and necessary goods during the pandemic. Publications like the Washington Post, the Los Angles Times, and Vice as well as broadcast networks like CNN covered the event, and social media posts about it were shared widely.

Many of the places where workers gathered to protest, such as New York and California, currently have stay-at-home orders. In pictures and video of the events from those locations, protesters are largely seen wearing masks and face coverings. It’s unclear if workers were able to maintain social distancing in each protest.

“We haven’t seen anything like this since the 1930s — a crisis like this and workers who are hurting badly,” said Thomas Kochan, a professor at MIT who leads research on work and employment. Kochan explained that, in the past, times of severe crisis have led to workers gaining rights, and he thinks the current conditions will “wake up” the general public to long-standing labor issues.

Organizers of the protests at different companies have remarkably similar demands: more access to protective gear like masks and gloves, extended time off to recover from sickness, and higher pay. While companies have changed policies in response to some of their concerns, workers say it isn’t enough. Instacart shoppers, Amazon pickers, and FedEx delivery workers have been meeting virtually through the pandemic on Zoom, Telegram, Facebook, and other platforms to coordinate today’s action.

“We formed this alliance because we all have one common goal, and it’s to save our communities and save our families,” said Christian Smalls, the lead organizer of the strike and a former Amazon warehouse employee at its Staten Island, New York, facility.

In March, Amazon fired Smalls after he organized a walkout at the facility where he worked. The company said he was fired for violating social distancing rules, an allegation that Smalls has denied. After the firing, a top lawyer at Amazon called Smalls “not smart or articulate” in leaked notes from an executive meeting. Amazon’s top leaders appeared to view Smalls as a flawed leader who wouldn’t be effective in organizing his peers.

.But Amazon may have underestimated Smalls. In the wake of his dismissal, the 31-year-old father of three gained the support of the mayor of New York City, State Attorney General of New York, and several senators to investigate the circumstances his firing. And now, with Friday’s protests, Smalls has proven that there’s an audience for worker issues beyond any one worker or company.

So while we aren’t witnessing a strike like the historic and violent May Day worker protests of 1886, when hundreds of thousands of workers demanded an 8-hour workday, Friday’s action was nevertheless a potent reminder that in a pandemic, companies can’t simply ignore workers’ demands. In the age of social media, even small groups of workers can attract huge amounts of attention.

"['Aaron Rupar', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,"Minutes after pledging to not lie, the new White House press secretary lied a whole bunch","Kayleigh McEnany’s first briefing as White House press secretary started off on a hopeful note — with a promise from her not to lie. That lasted for about all of 15 minutes.

“I will never lie to you. You have my word on that,” McEnany said early during the briefing, in response from a question from the Associated Press’s Jill Colvin.

""I will never lie to you. You have my word on that."" -- Kayleigh McEnany during her first press briefing as press secretary (bookmark this) pic.twitter.com/PqUhRAWiun — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) May 1, 2020

It’s a standard question White House reporters ask new press secretaries, and one that is rarely, if ever, lived up to fully. But it took all of two questions for Trump’s fourth press secretary to break that promise.

McEnany’s first lie from the White House podium came in response to a question about comments President Donald Trump made earlier in the day characterizing Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden as “far more compelling” than the accusations made against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. Asked to flesh out Trump’s thinking, McEnany characterized the Kavanaugh allegations as “verifiably false.”

“I think it was a grave miscarriage of justice with what happened with Justice Brett Kavanaugh. There’s no need for me to bring up the salacious, awful, and verifiably false allegations that were made against Justice Kavanaugh,” she said.

""The salacious, awful, and verifiably false allegations that were made against Justice Kavanaugh"" -- McEnany just lied, breaking the promise she made not to just minutes ago. The allegations against Kavanaugh were not verifiably false.



It was a good run. pic.twitter.com/XQp1yer9vt — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) May 1, 2020

But that’s a lie. Instead of being “verifiably false,” multiple accusations against Kavanaugh were found to be credible during the course of an investigation conducted by the New York Times that was published last fall, roughly a year after his confirmation to the court.

That wasn’t the only lie McEnany told during her first briefing. Asked about newly released FBI notes regarding the investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn that Trump and White House officials have been hyping as evidence that Flynn was “set up,” McEneny misquoted what the documents say to make them sound more incriminating than they are.

“We have a handwritten FBI note that says, quote, we need to get Flynn to lie, quote, and get him fired,” she said.

MeEnany just lied again. She misquoted the FBI notes that Trump is hyping (misleadingly) as bombshell evidence exonerating Michael Flynn. Compare what she said with what the note actually says: https://t.co/fwS2XHsXjy pic.twitter.com/iuOPZuhLl9 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) May 1, 2020

But the notes don’t say that. All they reveal is that before a January 2017 interview with Flynn, one investigator wrote down, “What is our goal? Truth/admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?” It’s important to keep in mind that at the time, the FBI had already gathered evidence that Flynn had broken the law. The notes do not indicate investigators went into the interview with the goal of manipulating Flynn into lying, as McEnany suggested.

There was more. Asked later why the public should find the sexual misconduct allegations against Trump from more than 20 women less credible than the one against Biden, McEnany said that “the president has swiftly denied all of these allegations that were raised four years ago.” While many of the allegations against Trump were made in 2016, E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of rape just last year.

McEnany's rationale for why Trump's denials of sexual assault are more convincing than Biden's is that ""the president has swiftly denied all of these allegations that were raised four years ago. He's always told the truth on these issues."" pic.twitter.com/dKKcmmEDpE — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) May 1, 2020

McEnany then concluded the briefing by reiterating her lies about the Flynn notes.

If her first outing is any indication, McEnany may end up being less hostile with reporters than Sarah Sanders. She may be less gaffe-prone than Sean Spicer. She may be more available to the public than the recently departed Stephanie Grisham, who never held a press briefing, making Friday’s the first one held by a White House press secretary in more than a year.

But like her predecessors, McEnany will use the White House briefing room to tell lies — even right after she promises reporters she won’t.

"['Emily Stewart', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,"Truly, what is up with Elon Musk","Elon Musk is playing some of his greatest — and most bizarre — hits: manipulating Tesla’s stock price, questioning the coronavirus pandemic, and being generally chaotic on Twitter.

On Friday, the South African-born entrepreneur fired off a series of missives on Twitter. He declared he’s selling all of his possessions and his home, again called to free America from coronavirus lockdowns, and said Tesla’s stock price is too high.

Tesla stock price is too high imo — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 1, 2020

Beyond the obvious “just what in the world is going on with Elon Musk” sentiment, Tesla investors are probably less than thrilled with his online adventures. The electric car company’s stock price dropped by about 10 percent.

Holy crap. How did @elonmusk time this stock call so well? He nailed it almost to the second. (Chart via @lorcanrk) pic.twitter.com/Bu1pRfzzuO — Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) May 1, 2020

Well known for being unpredictable, Musk, 48, has a knack for injecting even more uncertainty into already uncertain times. Amid the coronavirus crisis, he’s been all over the map — he first said the panic over the global pandemic was dumb, then decided it was serious and wanted to help, and is now, like the protesters at state capitols demanding an end to social distancing rules, calling for the country to be freed from protective measures.

Musk also got into hot water over tweeting about Tesla before and causing major moves in the price of its stock. He’s supposed to have some guardrails in place now around his social media activities , but apparently, the Tesla chief executive is not paying too much attention to them.

After his little tweetstorm on Friday, Musk noted that his girlfriend, the musician Grimes, is mad at him. Tesla investors probably are, too.

My gf @Grimezsz is mad at me — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 1, 2020

Some people speculated that Musk’s account had been hacked. It’s unclear if that’s the case. Twitter declined to comment on the tweets, and Tesla didn’t return a request for comment.

If this feels like déjà vu, it’s because it is

So here is the thing: It is possible that Musk is right that Tesla’s stock is overvalued. According to the Wall Street Journal, most analysts who follow the stock have it as a hold or a sell, meaning they’re not recommending buying it. Even with Friday’s dip, Tesla’s stock price was up about 70 percent year-to-date by the early afternoon.

That being said, Tesla has also reported a profit for three consecutive quarters, including its first-quarter earnings release, which came out this week and sent the stock up about 9 percent.

But whatever the merits of Tesla’s stock valuation, that’s not the point. The point is, CEOs don’t send out tweets about their stock prices at all, let alone saying they’re too high. And what’s more, this is not the first time Musk has found himself in a stock price-related pickle with regard to Tesla.

In the summer of 2018, Musk tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 and declared he had secured funding for such a deal. In turn, the company’s share price shot up to the point that the Nasdaq stock exchange halted the stock altogether for a while.

Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 7, 2018

After this, Tesla tried to do some clean-up and explained that Musk had talked to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund about some potential funding, but it wasn’t sufficient. The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk for misleading investors with his tweet, and in September 2018, the parties reached a settlement. It required Musk to step down as Tesla’s chair; Tesla and Musk paid $40 million in penalties; and the company hired a lawyer to monitor his communications, including the tweets.

Musk got into Twitter trouble again in February 2019, and in April of that year, an updated settlement also attempted to clamp down on Musk’s social media use and was supposed to stop him from tweeting about things that could move the company’s stock price. Judging by Musk’s Friday internet adventures, it appears he’s not super concerned about running afoul of the SEC again.

Elon’s gonna Elon, but maybe he could Elon less

Musk isn’t alone in being weird on Twitter. But the issue is that what he says and does there and elsewhere in public have very real implications. For one thing, people listen to him on the coronavirus front, so if he’s saying it’s a joke or suggesting the lockdowns need to be ended, others could follow suit.

And while investors aren’t always the most sympathetic class, a loose-cannon CEO who can cost you a ton of money — especially with the stock market and economy being especially volatile right now — is not doing you any favors. Perhaps especially in Musk’s case, many of Tesla’s investors have parked their money there because of Musk, because they’re fans of his and they believe in his abilities. With a single tweet, Musk then harmed a lot of people who are rooting for him and for his company. Musk also has an obligation to his employees to be responsible with the company’s future.

Ultimately, Elon’s gonna Elon, as he’s proven time and time again. He seems to be working out some stuff on Twitter, and I guess hopefully he’s okay.

"['Emily Vanderwerff', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Let’s talk about the ending of The Half of It,"The Half of It very nearly continues Netflix’s strong track record with teen comedies, of which the apex is still 2018’s To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before. Much of this modern teenage Cyrano de Bergerac, with a queer twist, is the kind of gentle fun you’d want, and both Leah Lewis’s lead performance (as the shy and awkward Ellie) and Alice Wu’s direction are terrific.

But throughout the first two-thirds of the movie, you might find yourself thinking things like, “Hey, Aster, the girl Ellie has a crush on, isn’t really a character, huh?” or “This sure seems like a lot of plotlines to cram into one movie!” or “Does anybody at Netflix understand how the college admissions process and/or time work?” These are minor quibbles in the face of the overall story, particularly when it comes to the easy-breezy friendship chemistry between Ellie and goofy neighbor Paul (Daniel Diemer), but you might find yourself thinking about them. At least a little bit.

In The Half of It’s last third, all of those problems come back at the same time. The resolutions to essentially every major storyline disappoint, and the movie relies on out of nowhere character turns that feel forced and unnatural. In particular, the third act undercuts what had, to that point, been one of the movie’s strong points — the small-town world it built for Ellie, Paul, and Aster to live in.

So let’s talk about why the ending of The Half of It lets the rest of the movie down, and why it’s ultimately so disappointing that it does. It’s so close to working.

Spoilers, of course, follow.

The actual ending of The Half of It isn’t bad. But to get there, it has to take some big leaps of logic.

The moment when The Half of It started to head south was in the wake of Paul scoring the first touchdown the characters’ high school football team had scored in over a decade.

Throughout the movie, Paul has been courting Aster, at least somewhat secretly (as she is far more popular than he), but Ellie has been the one doing most of the actual work of courting her, via handwritten letters and instant messaging apps. Aster thinks she’s falling for Paul; she’s actually falling for Ellie — classic Cyrano! The movie gives you just enough hints that Aster might be queer to suggest that this story could really be heading in any direction.

In the wake of Paul scoring the touchdown, though, he looks up into the stands to see Aster cheering him on, then looks over to see Ellie doing the same. Once the game’s over, he goes to find Ellie, presumably to talk about what he should do next in re: Aster. Instead, he kisses Ellie, because in a heteronormative romcom, this would be the part where the lead guy realized the nerdy lead girl was the right one for him all along. Ellie, horrified, pushes away from him. And, soon enough, Paul realizes that Ellie has feelings for Aster, not him.

This moment actually totally works. It’s a neat subversion of a romantic comedy trope, and it follows naturally from both Paul and Ellie’s arcs so far. But it completely spins the movie off its axis into some other version of itself entirely.

For starters, remember how I said that this was the first touchdown anyone had scored at the high school in over a decade? This is a thing that is basically not established in the film in any way, which made me realize how many other plot elements the movie had introduced without following up on them, an omen that didn’t bode well. (Similarly, this plot point badly tanks the film’s timeline, but we’ll get to that.)

Paul also needs to use this time to suddenly reveal that he thinks being gay is a sin, even though that’s not something that has been established as part of his character to that point. Yes, he goes to what seems to be a conservative church, and yes, such an attitude would be preached there. But Paul doesn’t seem to particularly believe in this form of Christianity to the degree that it would destroy this particular friendship. It comes across as what it is: a complication designed to draw Paul and Ellie apart just long enough for both of them to feel sad about missing their friend.

But also in here, it turns out that Ellie is about to leave for college, even though the timespan of the movie seems to have encompassed roughly a couple of months at the start of Ellie’s senior year. (The more I tried to figure out the movie’s timeline, the more it gave me a headache, which is maybe not what you want out of a teen romcom.) This is all part of a larger problem within The Half of It’s story structure, which is that it keeps awkwardly shoehorning in teen movie tropes — a school talent show, a big football game, college admissions essays — without really figuring out a way to give each of them weight. This wreaks havoc on the movie’s internal logic.

All of this comes to a head in what is somehow simultaneously the movie’s best and worst scene, a confrontation set at the same church we’re supposed to blame for Paul’s surprise homophobia. Ellie, who doesn’t believe, is the church organist (a thing established in the early going of the movie and then mostly forgotten about for most of its running time). Paul, as mentioned, attends the church. And Aster is the pastor’s daughter. This is a solid enough setup for Paul to declare his love and Ellie to admit she was the one who was actually courting Aster, causing the conservative congregation to gasp in shock.

Except ... that’s not what happens. Instead, Aster — a high school student — is proposed to by her boyfriend Trig, a complete nonentity of a character who seems to exist mostly so that Paul and Ellie don’t have their friendship torn apart by their competing crushes on Aster. Trig’s presence is scattered throughout the movie, and his intention to marry Aster is as well, but it’s clear, always, that Aster never cares much for him. Indeed, she spent most of the movie more or less dating Paul, going out with him to the local diner several times. How on Earth did gossip about this not get back to Trig, a character who seems to exist only when the plot needs him to?

The resolution of this scene — Ellie reveals that she wrote the letters to Aster by obliquely referencing something from them — does work well, but the path there is such a mess that its impact is muted, when it should be the film’s ultimate romantic highpoint. The whole sequence reveals how hollow the conceptualization of both the town and the church are, and how incidental many of the characters are to the plot. (I had forgotten Freaks and Geeks’ Becky Ann Baker was in this movie until she popped up in this scene to offer a witty bon mot.)

The actual ending of the movie: Ellie works up the courage to kiss Aster, who doesn’t return the gesture but doesn’t not return the gesture (Aster’s going off to art school, so give it a few years, Ellie!). Paul sees Ellie off to college.

It’s not bad, but it’s almost too little, too late, and it only served to make me wonder more about the convoluted timeline. It’s a disappointing ending to such a promising film.

Maybe teen movies aren’t supposed to balance this many elements? Except here’s one that did so perfectly!

Trust me when I say that all of the above is roughly half of what happens in the last third of The Half of It. (That sentence contains a lot of words that mean “fractions.”) I haven’t even talked about Paul’s dreams of making it big with something called “taco sausage,” or Ellie’s relationship with her dad, or the fact that she works at a railroad, or any other number of things, all of which are either ham-handedly resolved in the last third or dropped entirely.

When I was done with The Half of It, I found myself thinking that maybe all of the stuff it tried to cram into its story just didn’t work because there were too many elements, period. The movie would be better without Trig, with more of a focus on the church’s influence over the community and/or Paul, with a stronger attempt to make Aster her own character instead of “the love interest.” (There’s a half-hearted stab at this late in the second act that is a lovely scene but, again, too little, too late.)

Then I started thinking about another teen movie I’ve loved recently, which is also streaming on Netflix (though Netflix didn’t produce it): the 2016 Hailee Steinfeld vehicle The Edge of Seventeen. Like The Half of It, The Edge of Seventeen balances about 15 different plot elements across its running time, and like The Half of It, its timeline is hard to parse if you think about it too much. Both movies are even exactly the same length — 104 minutes. They’re both set in the Pacific Northwest! I could go on.

But Edge of Seventeen works wonderfully, spinning all of its plotline plates and never letting any of them drop. It has a seemingly preternatural sense of when to, say, check in on its main character Nadine’s relationship with her mother, then letting that relationship sit on the back burner for a while as the movie attends to other things. It is, in the story it’s telling, the movie The Half of It is trying to be, except Seventeen’s protagonist has a crush on a guy, not a girl. And if you compare the two films qualitatively, Edge of Seventeen is way better. (It was one of my favorite movies of 2016 and probably my favorite teen movie of the last decade.)

In trying to figure out why the disparity in quality between these two movies was so considerable, I realized precisely what separated them: In Edge of Seventeen, the other stories are only significant when they’re significant to Nadine. Her best friend starting to date Nadine’s brother, which serves as the film’s entire catalyst? It disappears from long stretches of the movie when Nadine cuts her friend off completely. Nadine’s fractious relationship with her mother? Not there when Nadine isn’t forced to care about it. The other characters have to make Nadine notice them for their stories to take center stage, and the audience remains focused on whatever Nadine wants in the given moment, which is usually to make out with the hot guy who works at the pet store.

The Half of It’s Ellie is a less caustic character than Nadine, so she’s less likely to just cut people off entirely. That makes her easier to root for, but it also means that when another character wanders in to the center of the story, she doesn’t do much to dislodge them. For as much as Ellie is this story’s protagonist, the one who’s actually driving most of the action forward is Paul (until it’s Trig, weirdly). Ellie is a protagonist defined by inaction — which makes sense for a small-town queer girl just trying to get to college, but which also means that in a movie so full of things happening, it’s too easy to lose sight of what the movie’s center is.

Most riffs on Cyrano focus on the central love triangle for this very reason — it’s such a potent idea for a story that you don’t need to add much to it. But boiling this down to the story of Ellie, Paul, and Aster, with a backdrop of small-town conservative Christianity, would have made the first two-thirds of the film feel more serious and weighty instead of light and breezy.

The choice to ever so slightly decentralize the love triangle was right for the first two-thirds of The Half of It, but it also ultimately sinks the movie when it’s abruptly forced to turn into a film where things actually happen. Ellie isn’t going to take over the story without being shoved to center stage. And the way the movie contrives to do that ultimately makes too little sense to register.

"['Constance Grady', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,Watch: N.K. Jemisin explains for the Vox Book Club why “cities are inherently terrifying”,"On Wednesday night, the Vox Book Club went live on Zoom for the very first time to talk with N.K. Jemisin about her new book, The City We Became. For 45 minutes, we discussed what makes cities powerful, New York’s dark history, and the uneasy legacy of H.P. Lovecraft. Also I — and, I have to assume, every last one of the more than 100 people watching — admired Jemisin’s impeccable collection of plushes.

The conversation was the culmination of the past month of discussion we’ve been having here at the Vox Book Club. Next week, we’ll be moving along to our May pick, Donna Tartt’s classic campus murder story The Secret History. But for now, we wanted to share our live event with all of you, including those of you who couldn’t make it.

You can watch the full video of my discussion with Jemisin above; highlights from our conversation are below. Enjoy, and come hang out in the comments if you’re moved to talk further about The City We Became.

“The threats to New York that I am embodying in the story are threats that have a kind of viral flavor to them”

Constance Grady

Some of the commenters in the book club have taken issue with the idea that New York City is the first North American city to have come to life so far. How did you make that choice?

N.K. Jemisin

Well, first of all, I like New York. But it’s not actually the first North American city to have come to life so far. New Orleans would have been the first. Because I love both cities, I’ve lived in both cities, but I think New Orleans’s culture formed and cohered just a little before New York’s did. New York’s culture is actually still forming. New Orleans’s culture has already reached a point of public saturation or public knowledge.

It’s about both how people inside the city and people outside the city perceive it. Everyone’s got this mythic idea of how New York and how New Orleans work, and that’s what triggers the change.

People know the names of boroughs in New York. People sing songs about New Orleans. Everyone knows “Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans,” even if they’ve never been to New Orleans. They’ve watched TV shows about it.

So New Orleans would have been the first city to come to life, but then something happened. And as [The City We Became] implies, there may very well have been something that happened in the case of all of the cities in the world in the last 50 years or so. São Paulo was the last city to be born without this extra interference that they start to realize is happening.

Constance Grady

So within the book, the interference with New York starts to act like an infection or a virus, spreading from person to person. What is it like to be putting out a book with a metaphorical virus threatening New York City, and disproportionately threatening people of color, at this moment of living through a pandemic?

N.K. Jemisin

Well, I sure as hell didn’t intend that! Given the vagaries of book publishing, I actually wrote this book almost two years ago. It would have come out last year, but after I finished it, I realized I had spent the last 10 years or so writing nine books, and I hadn’t taken a break in there. I was dealing with a lot of heavy personal family stuff, and I needed a break. So I took a year off, and [my publisher] Orbit decided to push back the release of the book by a year because of that. And so hilariously, it ended up dropping right in the middle of a global pandemic! Perfect timing. I did not intend this, obviously.

The threats to New York that I am embodying in the story, in various ways, are threats that have a kind of viral power, viral flavor, to them. I never really thought of gentrification as a viral thing, but it does operate in a very viral way. It jumps from one neighborhood to the neighborhood nearest by. It spreads insidiously. You see the warning signs of it, and then suddenly everything is changed in the area where it’s happened.

I, and other New Yorkers that I know of. tend to use disease metaphors when we talk about it. We talk about how when you can no longer get dollar coffees from the bodega and there are indie coffee shops all over the neighborhood, that’s stage one or two, and then when you see the Starbucks, that’s stage four and terminal.

So the metaphor ended up being very virus-related, and that was literally just happenstance. I was not expecting as many people as seem to have done to see that resonance, and to feel that resonance, and to react to it. But with the book’s release [landing] at the time that it has, and with the circumstances [it’s been released into], talking about New York at a time when New York is the epicenter of America’s response to this, it was really just a perfect storm of terrible things happening, and people needing a hook.

“Manhattan is literally built on trash and blood.”

Constance Grady

How did you come up with the personalities for the avatars? Because they’re quite distinct, each one.

N.K. Jemisin

Hilariously, I just decided to start with the stereotype. I have talked in other venues and on my blog about how stereotypes can be problematic. In this case, because what I am basing the energy and the life of the boroughs on is public perception, the general audience or attitude toward these places by outsiders who don’t really know them, I felt it was a good idea to start with the stereotype and then complicate that, and then make them real people beyond that.

Everybody knows Manhattan. Everybody that’s seen movies about New York or read books about New York, even if they’ve never been to New York or they hate New York, they think about Manhattan when they think about New York. We’ve seen that iconic skyline in movies and TV shows. We’ve heard all of the songs about the glitz and the glamour. I wanted to make Manhattan represent that by visually being a very handsome man, very charming, very friendly; the kind of person who gets along with almost everybody, who makes everybody feel like he’s one of them.

But then actual New Yorkers and anybody that’s lived here longer, anyone who’s studied the history of New York, understands that Manhattan is going to be a little darker than it looks. I’ve talked about this in other interviews, too, but Manhattan is literally built on trash and blood. The lower part of Manhattan, Wall Street, is landfill. People don’t seem to understand that, but Manhattan Island was a lot shorter way back when it first formed. The bottom part of it is literally built up from trash.

And the workers who did that: for the most part poor, black, Irish, other people, all the various ethnicities that have come and poured their energy and their lives, literally, into New York. There were some excavations that happened maybe a few decades ago, where they found buried bodies that had not been marked in any kind of way. And that’s now the African Burial Ground, because the bulk of the bodies were slaves and freed people who worked down on the foundations of Wall Street. They dropped. They worked so hard that they died. And they literally just got paved over with no markers, no gravestones, no anything.

So literally Manhattan is built on blood! And trash, and garbage, and deception, and theft, and a bunch of other things. So I wanted Manhattan to be superficially very charming, very attractive, and underneath, something kind of frightening.

I did this with all of the boroughs. To some degree, the perception of each borough is based on what the other boroughs think of it, and to some degree, it’s based on actual history.

So Staten Island, obviously: It’s the one part of New York that consistently votes red when the rest of the city consistently votes blue. There’s something cultural happening there that makes it very different from the rest of the city. They’ve tried to secede from the city! They have failed! I needed to acknowledge all of this. But I also wanted these characters to be people on top of all of that.

This is a trilogy. I didn’t really have time to really complexify all of the boroughs. I felt like it would have been crowded if I’d devoted the same amount of attention to all five of the protagonists, plus the primary avatar. So I focused my attention on three of the boroughs. I deliberately did not focus my attention on Brooklyn, because I live in Brooklyn and I love Brooklyn and it’s my favorite borough, and writers are supposed to murder their darlings. So I put Brooklyn on a back burner, and Queens, unfortunately, ended up on a back burner, but I did feel like I was able to focus my attention on Manhattan and the Bronx and Staten Island, at least for now.

“I like to fuck with people.”

Constance Grady

The ending with the great borough switcheroo — where you think the whole time Staten Island’s going to team up with them but she doesn’t, and then instead Jersey City comes out of nowhere — was so much fun to read. Did you always know that was where you were aiming at?

N.K Jemisin

Yes. The book is inherently kind of predictable. I meant for it to be kind of a sentai sendup, you know, the five-man team that comes together to fight evil. You know what that’s going to end as. You know that the five-man team is going to get over their personal dramas, and they’re going to get everything together, and they’re going to make it work. And that just felt super predictable to me. And it’s intentionally meant to be kind of silly and kind of predictable in that way, but I like to fuck with people.

I want to remind people, this is a trilogy. The story has only begun. There are two more pieces of it. There will come a time when there’s a big fight at the end and everybody gets together, and yes, that’s predictable. But who those everybodies consist of — I wanted to remind people that cities and all political entities are concepts. They’re social constructs. They’re not hard-and-fast entities that have to be the particular way that they are. And assumptions and external perceptions are just as powerful as things like charters and laws and tax boundaries.

Yonkers is possibly in the sights somewhere. Other parts of Jersey could potentially get swallowed into New York. New York is this kind of huge amorphous entity in the minds of people who think about New York. Many of them don’t understand New York, and so because of that, New York is this kind of giant blob that covers the whole tristate area. All of it is fair game, as far as I’m concerned.

Constance Grady

Speaking of giant blobs, so much of this book is in conversation with H.P. Lovecraft and the tradition he was writing in. What is your relationship with those books?

N.K. Jemisin

I have read a little Lovecraft. I am not a fan. What I am engaging more with is Lovecraft’s legacy within science fiction and fantasy. One of the things that triggered this was the whole conversation that arose around the World Fantasy Award a few years ago. The actual award itself, the statue, was a little stylized head of H.P. Lovecraft.

Anyone that wants to can go back and take a look at the conversation triggered when the award was given to Nnedi Okorafor, who is another black writer, Nigerian American, who won for Who Fears Death. Great book. She won the award, and then she was like, “Uh, do you guys understand just how racist he is? And the fact that this person’s head I now have to have in my house, because I’ve put most of my other awards on display? You’ve given me this honor, but the honor consists of the head of a person who would have hated me.” And she pointed out just how racist Lovecraft was.

Honestly, I had not paid a lot of attention to Lovecraft before that, and I had not realized, before that conversation, just how bad he was. What shocked me during that conversation is that a lot of science fiction and fantasy readers were aware of how bad he was. Like, even for a “man of his time,” he was exceptionally racist. And a lot of people were perfectly aware of how bad he was, and were okay with that. Thought there was nothing wrong with honoring him by making him part of this award.

So that was the part that I was really engaging with, was the idea that our faves are problematic but we’re going to ignore the problem. There was a whole debate about, “Do we go with the author-is-dead interpretation? Do we ignore the part of his life that was racist and just focus on the work?” Well, you can’t, with him. Because when you look at his letters and how he describes people of color and people who lived in New York City, you realize that that is the basis for his fear of the other, his fear of the unknown.

And that shows itself in his artwork as well, most prominently in his short story “The Horror at Red Hook.” Which is actually set in New York, and which actually does talk about the inherent degeneracy and scariness of people in Brooklyn.

I wanted to engage with that. I wanted to engage with the fact that his perception of the scariness of the diversity of New York and the complexity of New York — he found that terrifying, and he used it as the basis of horror. I find it fascinating, and I wanted to use it as the basis of power.

Constance Grady

And one of the things that’s so interesting about the reveal that the Woman in White is R’lyeh is that a lot of the things that made that city scary to Lovecraft — that it has non-Euclidean geometry, that it’s a city at all, that the creature inside of it is mostly worshipped by brown people — those are things that you have been deconstructing throughout the book and talking about why they’re not actually scary. So is there a possibility that there’s something going on with her that is more than what we currently know?

N.K. Jemisin

Yes, and I can’t talk about that without going into books two and three, which are still currently forming in my head. I’ve started writing book two, but I don’t like talking about works that are still in progress.

Most definitely there’s more to her, but really I just wanted to get at the idea that cities are inherently terrifying. Cities are harmful. In real life, cities change weather systems around them. They’re a massive environmental hazard. When you find ancient cities and you dig down a little, you realize they did things like change the water table nearby. There have been studies of cities that show how they change the climate, how weather systems change and twist when they pass through a city.

Cities are powerful, and inherently kind of harmful to bare nature. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that those cities are evil. That’s really just the nature of having a large agglomeration of human beings in one place.

I really just wanted to play with the inherent scariness of the city. And the forces that R’lyeh represents in my fiction versus what they do in Lovecraft’s fiction — I’m not scared of people of color and their strange non-Euclidean math. I’m not scared of math! Anymore. When I was a kid it was a different story. So I decided to make R’lyeh representative of what actually does scare me, which is homogenization, assimilation, being scared of math, that kind of thing. I just wanted to play with the concept of it.

It’s not going to be Lovecraft’s R’lyeh. There’s no tentacle monster sleeping in it, it’s obviously not stuck under the ocean. But I am still playing with the idea of it as a city that is still somehow inherently inimical.

“New York is not a city of young people.”

Constance Grady

One audience member says, “I thought the decision to have four of the five boroughs represented by women was really interesting, especially in light of New York’s male avatar. I would love to hear more about these gender decisions and what drove them.”

N.K. Jemisin

This is going to sound kind of woo-woo, but I literally just sat back and let the ethers tell me what each avatar needed to be, and then the avatars formed in my head. I did not make conscious choices in those cases.

When I originally started tossing around this concept in expanding the short story that this originated from, my first thought had been that because I was trying to do a sendup of sentai — sentai, for those of you who don’t know: Power Rangers. Five people wearing colored costumes who form like Voltron into a giant robot to fight evil. It’s the same concept that you see in like 9,000 superhero comics on this side of the pond and elsewhere around the world. Anyway. When I initially thought of making this a sendup of a sentai show, I initially thought that I would make them all teenagers, because that’s what sentai shows do. Sometimes you see really good parody shows where the sentais are all middle-aged office workers.

But then I started tossing around the idea with my editor, and she pointed out that New York is not a city of young people. It is not a city even primarily of young people. It attracts young people, but it attracts dreamers and visionaries as well, of all ages. And there are the people who are born and bred here, who will die here, as well. So I needed to complicate it away from my parody thoughts.

And then as I started to consider what each energy flavor of the city would be, the characters formed in my head. I didn’t make a choice about Bronca. That just became a thing.

“A single event had these ripple effects.”

Constance Grady

Another audience member asks, “Did you learn anything cool or new about New York during the writing process?”

N.K. Jemisin

I wasn’t so much interested in the history of New York as I was in the power dynamics of New York. That was something that I found more useful and fascinating. I’ve actually been listening to a really great history podcast of New York called School Colors; it’s talking about the 1968 teachers’ strike of New York, which I had never heard of, which was apparently the biggest teachers’ strike in the nation. It’s incredibly in-depth in talking about how this strike literally changed the city for the next generation. A single event had these ripple effects that were so powerful that it impacts how gentrification is playing out today. These are the kinds of things that I needed to understand.

I knew a lot of basic facts about New York. What I needed to understand was how they form like Voltron to impact how the city reacts to things, even now.

"['Emily Vanderwerff', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'May']",2020-05-01,The Parks and Rec reunion special was pretty good. Please don’t let it be the future of TV.,"The Parks and Recreation reunion special — in which the entirety of the show’s regular cast (sans poor Mark Brendanawicz) and a healthy portion of its recurring guest stars collaborated to film a new episode of the show while in quarantine — was so, so, so much better than I ever could have expected it to be.

It was also pretty significant proof that American scripted television production can’t be consistently and dynamically made during the Covid-19 pandemic. The special was a fun experiment that showed the absolute limitations of such an experiment. (I have somewhat high hopes for the upcoming One Day at a Time animated special, but it’s not like that’s a pivot the show can make on an ongoing basis.)

I did not tune into Parks and Rec’s special excited to see my favorite characters again. Though I liked the show, I’m happy enough to leave it in the past, where it feels increasingly like a weird relic of the Obama era.

But I was excited to see how some of the smartest minds in TV writing, led by showrunner Michael Schur, would tackle the problem of presenting an entire episode of television like a Zoom conference call and making it engaging and interesting.

To tell you the truth, they mostly didn’t. The special was frequently amusing, and I couldn’t help but feel warmth toward its charitable goals. (It was created to raise money for Feeding America.) But it never solved its central issue: how to tell a story in this format. And if some of the best minds in all of TV can’t solve that, how can anyone else be expected to do so?

The Parks and Recreation special takes its cues from a somewhat unexpected source

The central idea of this special is that Leslie Knope, feeling isolated from her friends in a time of social distancing, is making sure everyone reaches out to each other every day in a video chat phone tree. (In a sweet gesture, the characters speak frequently of the mental health strain of people having to be cut off from each other for so long.)

As Leslie calls Ron, and Ron calls April and Andy, and so on and so forth, the special both makes lemonade out of the “we had to shoot all of this without high-grade equipment” lemons and allows for everyone in the well-known cast — including movie star Chris Pratt — to appear onscreen. Each actor shows up for maybe five minutes, tops. It’s easy to see how the special was pulled together so quickly.

It also seems to have taken inspiration from a somewhat unlikely source: the recent duo of Saturday Night Live episodes produced with the cast sequestered at home. In and of itself, this isn’t remarkable. SNL is the highest-profile program to have produced any new episodes since quarantine began, and Schur is an SNL veteran himself. But what’s interesting is the way the special seems to have taken structural cues from the sketch comedy.

If you look at the special as an episode of a sitcom, it mostly falls flat. The story, such as it is, barely exists, and its big moment of emotional catharsis involves all of the characters performing a song from the show’s best season, in an ending the special doesn’t remotely earn. But if you think of the special as a collection of comedic sketches starring the Parks and Rec characters, it hangs together much better.

I think that’s why many of my favorite moments came from the assorted fake advertisements and news programs featuring some of the show’s many recurring players. The return of Perd Hapley (Jay Jackson) was exactly the burst of weirdo energy the special needed, and I even found myself enjoying characters I didn’t like all that much on the series. Jon Glaser’s Jeremy Jamm dominated some of my least favorite scenes of the show, but when he turned up in the special for a quick joke about offering a dental delivery service, it played more like something out of an offbeat comedy sketch than anything more substantial. And as a throwaway, it worked.

It’s a canny acknowledgment that when you’re telling stories via the limited cinematic capabilities of (simulated, I assume) video-conferencing software, you kind of have to go big and broad and not worry about storytelling nuance. (I was reminded, throughout, of multi-camera sitcoms, which have a similar relationship to a more limited cinematic palette.) Every character is their most self, and all of the gags are gags you remember liking when the show was still on, which is not all that dissimilar from how SNL operates — big and broad and full of callbacks.

But this special is also a big reminder that much of what made Parks and Rec work was the chemistry between the members of its ensemble, chemistry that necessarily cannot exist in a world where they’re all far away from each other. The special takes great pains to explain why its many different couples are not quarantined together, in ways that mostly make sense. But hearing those explanations just made me remember how much I liked watching Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt work together. TV is built atop actor chemistry, and the special was an inadvertent reminder of just how difficult it can be to sustain viewers’ interest when that chemistry isn’t there.

Will other shows do anything similar? I don’t know. I’d love to see a few of them try. I feel like Community — a sitcom that always turned limitations into strengths — would thrive in this format, and I think it would be fun to see the It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia gang turned loose on Zoom. (They’d almost certainly become the world’s most incompetent porn bombers.) But I don’t want to see too many more shows produced in this fashion. The Parks and Rec special was a lot of fun as an experiment. I don’t want to see it become the new normal.

"['Alexa Lee', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Megan Thee Stallion’s “Hot Girl Summer” is the dark horse song of quarantine,"Against the backdrop of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Megan Thee Stallion’s 2019 anthem “Hot Girl Summer” has been in heavy rotation on my Spotify account. The song has become an essential part of my personal quarantine soundtrack, and I think it should be part of yours, too. Don’t let the fact that it’s not summer, or that you don’t feel like your best “hot girl” self, or that you haven’t attended anything remotely resembling a party in months stop you from enjoying this song for a second longer.

Let me explain.

A quick refresher on where you may already know “Hot Girl Summer” from, in case you have completely forgotten anything that preceded the pandemic: “Hot Girl Summer” the song was predated by the hot girl summer movement, whose origins can also be traced back to Megan Thee Stallion. A self-proclaimed “hot girl coach,” Megan championed the victories of hot girls everywhere on her May 2019 album Fever and laid the foundation for “hot girl summer” to take the internet by storm.

Quickly brought to life online by black women and then adopted by everyone else on Twitter and beyond, hot girl summer was built on a bedrock of breezy confidence. As Megan Thee Stallion herself sagely noted in a July 17 tweet, “Being a Hot Girl is about being unapologetically YOU, having fun, being confident, living YOUR truth, being the life of the party etc.” Inspired by her fans’ hot girl enthusiasm, Megan Thee Stallion collaborated with artists Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign to release “Hot Girl Summer” in August 2019, capping off a season-long celebration of all things hot.

As Vox’s Rebecca Jennings wrote last year, the hot girl summer trend “[provided] a template against which people can perform the realities of their life.” Many months after the summer of 2019, “Hot Girl Summer” still reminds of the inclusive opportunity for people to live out the hot girl ethos and be “that bitch.”

The celebratory message of “Hot Girl Summer” hits differently in quarantine

I am a lot of things. Sadly, “that bitch” has never been one of them. This unfortunate reality, however, has not stopped me from soaking up “Hot Girl Summer” like it’s the last patch of sunlight in a rapidly darkening sky.

For one thing, the song is a smash. Megan’s signature flow is punchy and forthright, and her verses on “Hot Girl Summer” are no exception. She raps effortlessly about the joys of being sexy, rich, and beloved, pausing to take a breath only when it’s Nicki’s turn to rap about the joys of being sexy, rich, and beloved. And while Ty Dolla $ign’s presence on a song by and for hot girls is perplexing, his chorus acts as a pleasantly mellow bridge between Nicki and Megan’s energetic verses.

But as potent as the sheer bop power of “Hot Girl Summer” is on its own, the song has taken on newfound significance in the context of the novel coronavirus quarantine. It’s hard not to listen to “Hot Girl Summer” right now and feel as though its central themes — partying, celebrating yourself, being “on your bullshit” for bullshit’s sake — are relics of a pre-pandemic past.

Despite being less than a year old, “Hot Girl Summer” already seems imbued with the nostalgic glamour of a different era. It’s three minutes of jubilant escapism, wrapped in a Juicy J beat. The song recalls a time when I wasn’t glued to my phone’s disturbing news updates or half-heartedly stirring lentils in an apartment that I’m afraid to leave.

This isn’t to say that last summer was a utopian vacuum of poolside parties and “real hot girl shit.” On the contrary: Many of the systemic failures currently exacerbating the coronavirus crisis gained critical momentum over the course of last summer. In 2019, the Trump administration enacted a climate plan that was proven to increase air pollution levels and cause more premature deaths. Reproductive health care access dwindled rapidly in several states. ICE detained a record-breaking number of people in its facilities. The idea of hot girl summer was possibly as illusory then as it is now.

Still, as life under quarantine oscillates between stifling monotony and horror, revisiting Megan Thee Stallion’s 2019 song of the summer feels like a rose-colored look back at a better timeline. At its core, “Hot Girl Summer” preaches a message of fun self-determination. It promises that when you know your worth, summer is yours for the taking. And as incompatible as this attitude feels with the ongoing health crisis, it feels good to bask in Megan’s relentless hot girl optimism. Even if it’s only for a moment.

"['Constance Grady', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Book recommendations for when you want to change your perspective but can’t travel,"Welcome to the latest installment of Vox’s Ask a Book Critic, in which I, Vox book critic Constance Grady, provide book recommendations to suit your very specific mood: either how you’re feeling right now, or how you’d like to be feeling instead.

I’ve been slowly easing myself back into work reading, which is always fun, but it also means I rarely get to choose my book by mood. These are the downsides of getting to read for a living: You might be craving something about complicated female friendships but instead find yourself frantically binge-reading a political thriller about a pandemic.

But you, gentle reader, are under no such obligation. You can choose to read whatever you see fit. And I’m here to make sure you find your way to the book that suits you best. Let’s go.

The recommendation requests below, submitted to me via email and on Twitter, have been edited for length and clarity.

I’m looking for a book about an adventure at sea, preferably something sci-fi or fantasy. It would be awesome if it’s queer as well, but it doesn’t have to be.

The Lady’s Guide to Petticoats and Piracy by Mackenzi Lee is just what you need — pirates, magic, ace heroine exploring the question of whether she might be homoromantic, lots of adventure, and discussion of different modes of femininity. It’s technically a sequel, but it can stand on its own, and the banter is so much fun.

Since I can’t travel right now, I want to experience the world through my reading. In particular, I want a book that opens my eyes and changes the way I see the world.

Try Freshwater by Akwaeke Emezi, a semi-autobiographical debut novel from a genderqueer Nigerian author. The main character, Ada, is ogbanje, the term in Igbo cosmology for a child who holds an evil spirit in her body and is born to plague her mother by dying. The ogbanje narrates most of the book as Ada struggles with depression and her gender identity experience, and the voice Emezi creates for them is just electric.

Related Freshwater is an electric debut novel from a major new talent

I have found myself revisiting some of my old favorites from Dickens. I’d love an author that can introduce me to characters (dare I call them friends?) in our own age.

Donna Tartt is the author people usually call our modern-day Dickens, but I don’t know if she’s what you’re looking for; her characters are a little darker than Dickens’s usually are. Instead, you might like Pachinko, by Min Jin Lee. It’s a multi-generational novel about a Korean family that immigrates to Japan just before World War II, and it heavily references both A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations. It’s a very rich book, with beautifully drawn and specific characters.

If I were looking for a crossroads of Kelly Link’s uncanny slipstream wit, Angela Carter’s delicious diction, and Boccaccio’s layered narratives, where would I turn?

Ooh, a tall order! You might like Helen Oyeyemi, who writes very elegant and twisty stories that often riff off folklore. I’d start with Mr. Fox for her, and then move to either Boy Snow Bird or the short stories in What Is Yours Is Not Yours. Also check out Carmen Maria Machado’s story collection, Her Body and Other Parties, which is very modern-day Angela Carter. Finally, try Mary Toft; Or, the Rabbit Queen by Dexter Palmer. It’s based on a true story about a woman in 18th-century England said to have given birth to a rabbit, and Kelly Link gave it a nice blurb.

Because life is so strange right now, I’ve found myself drawn to books in which ridiculous things happen, but the author tells it straight. I’m looking for books with manic, maybe delusional but nonetheless weirdly life-affirming energy, rather than the dark grimness we usually associate with absurdism.

Fun and tricky! Okay, let’s see what we can do here.

I think Nell Zink might be your girl, maybe starting with Nicotine. Zink has an extremely deadpan voice, and when ridiculous things happen in her books, she always tells it straight. Lincoln in the Bardo is not exactly absurdist, but it has elements of absurdism (a ghost with a permanent erection), and it’s got a lovely affirmational ending.

If you’d like me to recommend a book for you, email me at constance.grady@vox.com with the subject line “Ask a Book Critic.” The more specific your mood, the better!

"['Constance Grady', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Lawrence Wright’s new pandemic thriller is infuriating to read,"Almost any novel about a pandemic would feel unnervingly prescient right now. But the new thriller The End of October, by Lawrence Wright, feels more prescient than most.

Wright is a writer for the New Yorker who won a Pulitzer for his 2007 nonfiction book The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11. In The End of October, out this week, he puts his reporting background to use as he imagines what would happen if a novel virus were to spread across the globe. And the scenario he conjures is eerily close to the one we’re currently living through.

The End of October is not a good book if we’re talking about sheer storytelling craft. The plot hums along ably enough, but the characters are flat, the women exist mostly to be sexually assaulted and/or die, and the prose is workmanlike at best. You’re not reading this book to experience a beautiful work of art.

Under normal circumstances, it would be an airport thriller, the kind of book you buy on a whim when your flight is delayed and leave on the plane when you’re done. But under our particular circumstances, in which I deeply hope you are not engaging in any kind of nonessential travel whatsoever, things are different.

What makes The End of October compelling to read right now is that Wright researched the hell out of what kind of infrastructure the US would need to survive a pandemic. He concluded that we did not have it. And then he drew on his formidable knowledge of domestic and international politics to imagine what would ensue.

He got disconcertingly close to reality.

In The End of October, social distancing helps stave off the worst of a pandemic. Then social distancing ends and things get really bad.

The second time I put down The End of October and said, “Oh god, too soon,” was when Wright’s unresponsive president — never named — puts his callow vice president in charge of the pandemic response team.

The pandemic in this case is the result of a novel influenza virus, one quickly dubbed the Kongoli flu. (The World Health Organization’s new guidelines against naming illnesses after places haven’t filtered through to the world of this book.) It’s a hemorrhagic fever that first emerges in an Indonesian refugee camp among a group of immunocompromised HIV-positive refugees. But when Wright’s hero, a WHO microbiologist named Henry Parsons, visits the camp to investigate the new disease, he accidentally exposes his driver to infection. And the infected driver, carrying the disease asymptomatically, proceeds to make the pilgrimage to Mecca.

The driver dies. Henry, who realized the danger he was in only too late, manages to talk Saudi Arabian officials into putting Mecca under quarantine, but not for long. Plus, he knows he’s only buying time for scientists to begin planning a global crisis response, anyway: The disease is carried by birds, which means it will inevitably spread across the world.

Rating: 3 out of 5 vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark

Meanwhile, the quarantine in Mecca inflames existing global tensions. Iran attacks Saudia Arabia, claiming that it is holding Iranian citizens without cause. Russia and the US use the ensuing conflict to begin a proxy war, with each superpower blaming the other for the spread of the virus. In strategic meetings, White House officials dismiss the virus as a distraction. It may or may not ever reach the US, they reason, but the threat of war with Russia is absolutely concrete.

The first time I put down the book and said, “Oh god, too soon,” came during one of those early strategic meetings. A public health service officer is trying to explain to the National Security Council Deputies Committee exactly why they should be worried about a pandemic.

First, she says, there’s the issue of the timeline. “With luck on our side, we could have an experimental vaccine for small-scale testing in six months,” the officer says. “This all takes time, especially scaling up to millions of doses. But we don’t have time.” The virus is already spreading, and it will arrive in the US well before a vaccine will be ready.

The deputy secretary of state begins to grow “very impatient” with this lecture. “We don’t really need a lesson on flu,” she observes. She wants to talk about war with Russia.

But it isn’t a normal flu, the public health officer explains. There’s no immunity within the general population. Unless the government takes urgent measures, nearly everyone will catch it. And many of them will die.

Moreover, once news of the pandemic gets out, there will be the problem of managing public fear. “There will be runs on the stores,” the public health officer says. “Pharmaceuticals, groceries, batteries, gas, guns, you name it. Hospitals will be overwhelmed, not just with sick people but with the worried well.”

It would be best, she concludes, if the population could just be encouraged to shelter in place: “borders closed, sports and entertainment facilities shuttered, nonemergency cases discharged from hospitals, schools closed, public meetings postponed, and the government shut down.”

In response, “The deputies simply stared at her.”

I wanted to reach through my Kindle screen and strangle them.

Despite misgivings from government officials, the US does eventually begin to implement social distancing measures, with stores and other businesses shutting their doors. And those measures are successful. The virus is quickly contained. Not that many people die: The death toll is “within the parameters,” Lawrence writes, “of what people thought was an ordinary flu season.” And so, responding to mounting political pressure to “let the economy breathe,” the US drops its measures. That’s when things get really bad.

Hospitals run out of ventilators, along with masks, gloves, and diagnostic test kits. India and China are no longer able to produce essential medicines because they are fighting the pandemic within their own borders, and the US has no stockpiles of those medicines. The fabric of society begins to crumple. The CDC predicts that another wave of the disease will arrive within six months, by the end of October.

The End of October is a pulpy book. I resent it for coming true.

At this point in the book, things also start to get pulpy. Or, to put it more accurately, the part of The End of October’s already-pulpy plot that has not ended up unexpectedly coming true starts to make itself known. Russia takes advantage of the global mayhem to attack the US’s infrastructure, knocking out the electric grid. And the mounting conspiracy theory that the virus was manmade turns out to have some truth to it.

But even this plot twist has some unnerving resonances with our own reality. One of Wright’s major suspects for the question of who designed the virus turns out to be a team of ecofascists, and their rhetoric about how it is the rest of the world that must be saved from human beings is awfully close to the “we are the virus” meme that’s all over the internet in the real world.

As I read The End of October, I found myself resenting it. It was such a silly potboiler of a novel, with such unbelievable characters, such leaden sentences, such infuriatingly clumsy dialogue. How dare the world in which I am actually living so closely resemble a fucking airport thriller?

Wright is undoubtedly a gifted reporter and observer of the world, and the fact that he was able to so clearly see where the existing fault lines in our social fabric lay and how they could be exacerbated by a pandemic shows real skill on his part. But the fact that Wright got so many of his details overwhelmingly right is also a reminder that this pandemic did not come out of nowhere. It was not difficult to predict. It was, in fact, something that we were told was coming over and over again, something that the people we elected to protect us from such a pandemic chose to willfully ignore.

This pandemic should not have caught us off our guard. It should have been as easy to see coming as the final twist in a cheap thriller.

"['Charles Bramesco', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,"As unemployment skyrockets, the new film Sorry We Missed You couldn’t be more relevant","The coronavirus pandemic has thrown every American into a state of emergency — if not in the immediate medical or financial sense then in the indirect economic one, as joblessness skyrockets to record highs. Freelancers typing away at home and gig workers risking exposure out in the field have felt the strain more harshly than most, with many left in a no man’s land between diminished rates of incoming work and ineligibility for unemployment benefits.

Enter the CARES Act, sweeping new legislation designed in part to toss a life raft in the direction of the gig economy. The bill’s most eye-catching stipulation involves a $600-per-week stimulus accessible to anyone dealing with professional hardship, on top of unemployment benefits specified by their individual states.

It’s a huge boon to those in need, and it’s been pilloried by the bootstrap-pullers of the world as mollycoddling. But the age-old narrative of handouts breeding a poor work ethic has received a sorely needed rejoinder in one of the films recently released to the American public via the new “virtual cinema” system. Ken Loach’s Sorry We Missed You has finally been made available in the US following a world premiere at Cannes last year, a run in its native Britain, and a scuttled theatrical release in the US. And it arrives on our shores not a moment too soon, putting a human face on the talking points of the gig economy debate. By looking closer at one struggling family in the working-class Newcastle region, Loach exposes the human stakes of our identical crisis across the Atlantic.

The film has come to American viewers at a pivotal time for gig economy workers, acting as a meticulous beat-by-beat walkthrough of the injustices they face on the job. The number of real-world people coping with the same unenviable situation depicted onscreen continues to grow, and they get a sympathetic surrogate in Loach’s protagonist. His many tribulations lay bare just how dire making ends meet can be when working for the likes of companies like Amazon, Instacart, and others that rely on contract employees who aren’t entitled to the same benefits or protections as full-time ones.

Sorry We Missed You puts a human face on the hardships of gig economy work

We learn early on in Sorry We Missed You that the Turner clan — workhorse Ricky (Kris Hitchen), supportive wife Abbie (Debbie Honeywood), teenage son Seb (Rhys Stone) and moppet 11-year-old Liza Jane (Katie Proctor) — has been living lean since the financial downturn of 2007-2008. In the job interview that opens the film, Ricky articulates the salient points of his circumstances and personality, both of which sound lamentably familiar to any news-reading American: He believes in the virtue of labor, taking pride in never accepting government assistance. Having spent most of his life as a landscaper, he can no longer keep up with the backbreaking physical strain as he gets older. He figures that a contract job driving for Parcels Delivered Fast! — a package delivery service all but named Schmamazon — would be a good career pivot. Eager for an opportunity to be his own boss and make some real money, he’s ruled an ideal candidate and hired on the spot.

Except he’s not “hired,” he’s “onboarded.” Loach raises the first red flag about three exchanges into Ricky’s orientation, when his supervisor starts using pointed, loaded language. He makes the crucial distinction that Ricky will not work “for” PDF, but “with” them. Ricky doesn’t earn wages; he’s instead charging PDF fees. He’s not an employee — he’s a one-man franchise. The jargon makes normal old servitude sound fresh and new. “Master of your own destiny,” growls PDF overseer Maloney (Ross Brewster). “Sloughs the fuckin’ losers from the warriors.” Ricky cannot afford to let this unsettling messaging give him pause, and he takes the job.

He learns all too soon that these words contain traps into which he’s already fallen. Every aspect of PDF’s corporate doctrine shifts responsibility from the company to the individual, forming a parallel with the New York Times’ blockbuster 2019 exposé on Amazon’s business practices. That story began with the shocking case study of an overtaxed driver who caused a child’s death in an on-the-job car crash, only to find herself solely liable for any legal recompense while Amazon shrugged its shoulders. Ricky finds himself holding the bill again and again in the same fashion, albeit for less extreme incidents, his first being a parking ticket that comes out of his pay. His every misstep ends with him kicking money back to the people paying him, whether those missteps involve the slightest delay in razor-thin one-hour delivery windows or his vehicle itself.

The matter of transportation first introduces the grim domino effect through which Sorry We Missed You traces Ricky’s decline. Like all of Amazon’s “delivery service partners,” he must provide his own up-to-code van to haul the day’s packages, and a PDF representative presents him with the options to rent or buy one from the company. (Though the script never directly invokes the A-word, the one-to-one comparisons leave little to the imagination.) He rightly reasons that he’ll gain more in the long run by buying, but like many members of his socioeconomic strata, he has to make sacrifices to scrounge up the cost. His family agrees to sell their own car, leaving Abbie to take the bus to the houses of the patients she cares for as a home nurse. Her mobility issues make fulfilling her duties at her own job more complicated, while Ricky can barely finish his daily list of deliveries. Their day-to-day difficulties keep compounding.

In the Turners’ two-pronged battle to remain solvent, Loach does what a news report can’t by vividly rendering the emotional and psychological ramifications of their inhumane working conditions. Both Abbie and Ricky cherish the face-to-face element of their occupations; an early scene illustrates her tender bedside manner with her patients, while Ricky mentions in his initial interview with PDF that meeting new people was his favorite aspect of his old nine-to-five. He fancies himself something of the jolly neighborhood mailman, chatting up the recipients of his assorted packages. Maloney sets him straight at the end of his first day, telling him that he’ll never make all his dropoffs unless he briskly moves from one house to the next. The mounting demands of Ricky and Abbie’s work leave them no time for the pleasantries that make any job survivable.

The trouble follows them home as well, where Ricky and Abbie’s forced workaholic schedules take a toll on their kids. With a lack of parental guidance and no exemplar of an adult life worth pursuing, Seb acts out and runs afoul of the local cops. Ricky’s constant exhaustion makes him edgy at the dinner table and greatly exacerbates the inevitable fights with his son, which culminate in a smack that only sends Seb out to cause more havoc. In the film’s most heartrending moment, Liza Jane hides her father’s keys so he’ll have no choice but to spend a little more time with them. Loach painstakingly shows that the companies enforcing these overtaxing standards have a holistic negative effect on the individual, indirectly making every part of their life more stressful. Ricky’s job wears on the whole family, even if they’re not personally clocking in.

Sorry We Missed You — titled for the phrase of hollow politeness printed on the slips that PDF sticks on absent customers’ doors — rejects any resolution for Ricky’s ever-increasing debt to the corporation utterly disinterested in the obstacles it’s deliberately laid for him. A rough mugging results in fines for lost parcels, fines for missing deliveries, and then one last fine for the scanner his assailants smash, totaling upward of one thousand pounds. He can only return to work and get back on the hamster wheel that goes nowhere.

The film positions itself in a hot-button debate that concerns all Americans

Ricky and the thousands of real people living his nightmare generally exist in the abstract for the pundits and commentators weighing what their fate ought to be. When the CARES Act was detailed, think-tank types wasted no time doing the math on whether the benefits would be paltry enough to keep the working class motivated. This ideological bloc posits that providing too much assistance makes unemployment a more appealing prospect than work, somehow seeing that scenario as proof that aid is too great and not that wages are too low. Loach’s film does the work of putting their theories into practice, showing how policy decisions made in isolation ripple out into tragedy once they’re enacted.

In an op-ed at The Hill published in March, economist and Trump campaign adviser Stephen Moore and conservative super PAC official Phil Kerpen restated the right’s favored criticisms of public aid programs. From the opening salvo that “public policies should reward productive behavior rather than punish it,” they denigrated the proposed $2 trillion relief stimulus as a possible “back door scheme by Democrats to greatly raise the minimum wage.” A report from CNBC painted a decidedly different picture, raising the point that “often in a downturn, clients delay paying freelancers for work already done, leaving them with little or no income for extended periods of time.”

CNBC cited Freelancers Union executive director Rafael Espinal as declaring the CARES Act “an amazing win” for gig economy workers and freelancers heretofore uncovered. Sorry We Missed You fits squarely into the argument he’s making, using the mechanisms of narrative to carry it out to its logical conclusion. Loach shows the dark failure of public aid, what happens when the people a government should be caring for fall through the cracks.

Loach’s film was made in a pre-coronavirus world, but recent developments have only served to underscore the points he makes. Ricky lives from check to precarious check, an existence known all too well to freelancers, including this one. And like the average pen for hire, he discovers that putting in the work won’t necessarily free him from a Kafkaesque maze of small-print doublespeak and Catch-22s. He’s playing a losing game, one that CARES makes somewhat more winnable. But that doesn’t change the fact that everyone working is still playing, and even if we may have better odds, the house always wins.

"['Alex Abad-Santos', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Gyms in some states are starting to reopen. Is it actually safe to go?,"At this point in the coronavirus pandemic, fantasies about life after it are in full force. Some dream of the first restaurant they’ll go to again once restaurants reopen. Others think about the bars or parties they’ll go to with friends. Those who haven’t had the chance to go to the beach yet dream of summer outside. And many of us around the country, your humble correspondent included, can’t wait to get back into a gym.

Gyms and boutique fitness classes, from yoga to cycling to more intensive workouts like Barry’s Bootcamp, are forms of exercise, sure. They also function as a form of therapy, a mental health benefit, a hobby, and stress-relief outlets for the people that love them. Gyms and studios have been shut down due to the particular health risks they pose — what with potentially contaminated surfaces, lack of social distancing, heavy breathing, and on and on.

On May 1, states like Georgia and Oklahoma will make the first steps toward bringing gyms back into the fold, despite criticism of reopening plans from some health experts. And experts warn that it actually might be more dangerous to work out at gyms now than before. There’s good reason to continue to avoid them, even if they are open.

The coronavirus risk of going to the gym

Back in the early stages of the pandemic, health experts I spoke to explained that social distancing and cleanliness are particularly difficult to maintain at fitness locations, making particularly risky places to visit during the Covid-19 outbreak. Those same experts I spoke to tell me now those risk factors still apply, and gyms may even be more dangerous to patronize now for anyone vulnerable to the illness.

One problem with gyms is that the equipment is shared between all members. Every piece of equipment you touch has likely been touched by someone else. That “someone else” could potentially not know they have Covid-19 and coughed on their hand, or they touched a different piece of contaminated equipment and didn’t properly sanitize it before or after. Gyms know this and employ people to clean equipment, but that doesn’t mean every yoga mat or dumbbell or pull-up bar gets thoroughly cleaned.

The other factor is the lack of social distancing.

Prior to their closings across the country, fitness classes were in initial phases of instituting increased cleaning and social distancing measures. Barry’s Bootcamp, for example, was booking classes at half-capacity before deciding that shutting down its live, in-person classes was safer for the public. Many franchise gyms, on the other hand, had not limited their capacity numbers, only promising that they’d upped their cleaning regimens.

Choosing not to dramatically decrease the number of people using a gym at a time makes it difficult to keep the recommended 6 feet of distance away from each other. But many studios don’t have the luxury of free space or of minimizing how many members they can serve at a time.

“Gyms can be difficult places to maintain social distancing and the volume of high-touch surfaces and objects makes them uniquely challenging for infection prevention efforts,” Dr. Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist and biodefense researcher, told me. “Moreover, in those environments where social distancing is difficult, the CDC has recommended masks, which you can’t really do when working out.”

And since the start of the pandemic’s outbreak across the United States, there’s a new factor that Americans now have to deal with: the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus has gone up all over the country.

“Especially in Georgia, cases are increasing, so you have even more potentially infected people now than you did a month ago,” Dr. Tara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University in Ohio, told me over email. “This makes going to a gym even more risky.”

Hong Kong has been celebrated for halting its outbreak. It still won’t open gyms.

As the coronavirus pandemic has played out, certain cities and countries have been lauded as models in tackling the disease and reducing infection rates. One of those places is Hong Kong, which used a combination of social distancing, travel restrictions, and contact tracing measures to stamp out the virus. Around mid-March, reports said that the country had contained the virus, and since then, Hong Kong has seemingly squashed a second wave of the virus.

On April 20, Hong Kong reported zero new cases of coronavirus — a huge milestone. And in the face of that achievement, the government announced that its social distancing measures, including shutting down gyms, would be extended for at least another two weeks. In South Korea, another shining example of how to best handle the outbreak, gyms had been shut down too, and restrictions are only loosening this week.

In contrast, the United States has surpassed 1 million confirmed cases and over 55,000 deaths. Georgia alone, according to its health department, currently has over 24,000 confirmed cases.

“One of my biggest concerns is gyms opening in states like Georgia, where there is continued community transmission but the governor has pushed to reopen,” Popescu said. “My hope is that gym owners are exceedingly cautious to reopen and set in place stringent infection control measures to ensure the safety of their patrons.”

Gyms in Georgia will take some precautions upon their reopening, like restricting capacity in the gym itself and group fitness classes, according to USA Today. But there are some less consistent measures. Some independent gyms have said they’ll ask their patrons to wear masks while others won’t, and some facilities will undertake phasing-in measures like moving equipment to comply with social distancing, while others are just limiting the number of people who can be using the equipment at a time.

Both experts I spoke to encouraged alternatives like working out from home (perhaps through online training or fitness classes), or working out outside, where the chances of making direct contact with contaminated material are relatively lower. This could change if gyms and fitness classes implement and adhere to disinfecting and social distancing measures, and if the disease outbreak subsides. But given the unpredictability of the current situation, gym-goers are advised to hold off on returning for a while longer.

“In areas with continued/increasing community transmission but opening gyms, I would discourage going to the gym and focus on what you can do at home or outside,” Popescu said.

Smith agreed.

“As much as I’d love to get in a workout, I’m not chancing it immediately when our gyms open back up here, and I’d urge caution to others.”

"['Constance Grady Aja Romano Alex Abad-Santos', 'Constance Grady', 'Aja Romano', 'Alex Abad-Santos', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-27,Sunday’s virtual Sondheim concert was the most cathartic experience of quarantine so far,"On Sunday night, stars of stage and screen gathered in their homes to put on a virtual concert in celebration of legendary Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim’s 90th birthday. The concert, hosted by Raúl Esparza, was an intimate Zoom celebration. The party was periodically plagued by technical glitches — it started more than an hour late, after a long period in which no sound was audible — but in the end, it didn’t matter. The whole experience turned out to be perfect for this moment in time, whether or not you’re a musical theater devotee. Sondheim is our great bard of loneliness and alienation, and his birthday concert, officially titled “Take Me to the World,” makes a strong argument that he’s the de facto poet laureate of this social distancing moment.

Sondheim’s birthday was actually March 22, but Sunday night was a good time to celebrate nonetheless: April 26 also marked the 50th anniversary of the opening of Company, one of Sondheim’s most beloved shows. Company was on the cusp of a gender-bent revival on Broadway until the pandemic shut down the entire theater season; you could find its planned stars, Katrina Lenk and Patti LuPone, in Sunday’s tribute instead.

The full concert is nearly two and a half hours long, but it’s well worth watching on YouTube: You get to see Jake Gyllenhaal belting his way through a love duet with Annaleigh Ashford, Melissa Errico doing a stripped-down and lovely take on “Children and Art,” and Jason Alexander telling the story of how Sondheim wrote one of the songs in Merrily We Roll Along purely to mess with the actor. But if you don’t have a spare two and a half hours to spend today, we’ve assembled 12 highlights for you.

Pour yourself a glass of something, settle in, and prepare to feel some very cathartic feelings. As it turns out, no one is alone.

“Johanna” from Sweeney Todd — Katrina Lenk

here’s the full vid of katrina lenk singing johanna pic.twitter.com/mY9HaKO2Gm — jw jpw talk to eabc other (@LITTLESONGBlRD) April 27, 2020

“Johanna” is from Sondheim’s creepy, pulpy, pitch-black tragicomedy Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. The musical itself features murder, cannibalism, and a very horny, rape-y judge. “Johanna” is a song about Todd’s estranged daughter, who’s now the ward of said judge, Judge Turpin. Turpin keeps Johanna locked up, in a scenario that’s more like a kidnapper keeping his victim captive than a fairy-tale princess in a castle.

Lenk’s performance, particularly in her vocals and inflections (she also plays the guitar!), divorced the song from its original context, removing the horror and generally unnerving tone. In doing so, Lenk made me appreciate how Sondheim acutely wrote this song about longing and love, and how fine the line is between those feelings and the darkness of obsessive lust. Sondheim was so aware of that threshold and tension throughout his work, but he best used it to create the surreal tragedy of Sweeney Todd and “Johanna.” —Alex Abad-Santos

“It Takes Two” from Into the Woods — Beanie Feldstein and Ben Platt

It’s become déclassé among Sondheim fans to express too much affection for the fairy-tale musical Into the Woods, arguably the most mainstream and commercially successful of all his work. But Into the Woods featured heavily in his 90th birthday concert, and the songs themselves made the case for why. “It Takes Two” is ostensibly about a husband and wife team trying to collect four magical items in three days’ time so they can feed a cow to heal a witch to get a baby, and — look, it’s complicated. But the song is really about the wonderful surprise of falling in love all over again with someone you thought you knew.

“It Takes Two” is so exuberant that you barely even have to sing it to sell it, but Feldstein and Platt sing the heck out of it and look like they’re having a blast. It’s a great moment that reminds us of the reason for Into the Wood’s relative commercial success: It’s vibrant, singable fun. For all we talk about Sondheim’s complexity, social themes, and cultural importance, there’s true joy, humor, and love behind everything he writes. —Aja Romano

Sunday in the Park with George takes place across two generations. The first act is about the 19th-century pointillism artist George Seurat, while the second act follows George’s great-grandson, also an artist and also named George. “Lesson #8” is from the second act, and it comes after 20th-century George’s grandmother dies.

In the song, George is going through his great-grandmother’s old French-to-English lesson book — hence “Lesson #8” — and he’s thinking about how he misses his grandmother and how he’s having trouble making art. And so I’ve always thought of it as a song about being artistically blocked and the depression that comes with it, about losing faith in one’s ability to see beauty in the world.

But I don’t think I’ll ever be able to hear this song now without thinking about Mandy Patinkin standing in his backyard with his dog, near tears as he sings a cappella, “Where are the people out strolling on Sunday?” Patinkin made it a song about loneliness and isolation, which is to say he made it a song about this particular moment in time. It’s an enormously warm and vulnerable performance, and right now, it’s incredibly cathartic to watch. —Constance Grady

One of the most effective moments of the evening was the hard cut to Lea Salonga — Broadway legend, owner of the world’s most perfect voice, and objectively the best Disney princess — singing “Loving You” from 1994’s Passion. Passion is perhaps Sondheim’s most challenging show within a long career of challenging shows. In Passion, a manipulative woman falls in love with a young soldier and proceeds to slowly pry him away from his current, passionate love affair. It’s a portrait of love as dark, ugly, possessive, jealous, bitter, and unapologetically intense, all accompanied by some of Sondheim’s most lush and soaring music.

Donna Murphy originated the difficult onstage role of Sondheim’s obsessive antihero, but in this moment, Salonga owns the song. Her tremulous warble and the dark edge she gives to wryly simplistic lines — like “loving you is not a choice and not much reason to rejoice” — embody both her mesmerizing talent as an actress and Sondheim’s genius at manifesting characters through their songs. “Loving You” sounds like a simple love song, until you look more closely and realize the singer is grimly vowing to stalk the object of their affection until they die. By the time you get to the line, “Loving you is not in my control,” you realize that “love” in this framing is dangerous and sober. Salonga sells it with quiet determination, and it’s enthralling. —AR

The title of Sondheim’s birthday show was “Take Me to the World.” Not only is the title itself apt for quarantine, but so is the show from which it came. Few people outside of Sondheim obsessives know about Evening Primrose, the 1966 television musical Sondheim wrote starring his bestie Anthony Perkins as a poet who becomes trapped in a department store overnight and discovers a commune of people hiding from the world there. If you want to know more about it, the full version and numerous clips are scattered across YouTube, featuring the many great songs this hour of TV gave us, including “Take Me to the World.”

The Evening Primrose story and its theme of trapped refugees longing for the larger world made for an unexpectedly sweet refrain throughout the evening. Of the multiple Evening Primrose performances, Benanti’s haunting, melancholic performance of “I Remember Sky”— sung flawlessly while leaning against her bathtub, no less — made us yearn for the lost art of going outside. —AR

“No More” comes during Into the Woods’s darker, heavier second half, as the fairy-tale frolic of the first act is starting to fall apart. It’s the cri de coeur of the Baker, the show’s protagonist, as he realizes that life is full of terrible obstacles from which there is no escape — and if he tries to run away, he will lose the good things in his life as well as the bad.

Chip Zien, who originated the role of the Baker on Broadway in 1987, knows how to go straight to the meat of the song just as well now as he did 33 years ago. And in the final moments of his performance, he added a lovely and tender grace note when he picked up the hat he wore to play the Baker on Broadway. It’s a nod both to his own show and to Sondheim’s other iconic James Lapine collaboration: Look, he saved the hat. —CG

“The Flag Song,” cut from Assassins — Brian Stokes Mitchell

Assassins is perhaps Sondheim’s best and most upsetting musical — a devastating postmodern critique on the hollowness of the American dream, explored through the lives of the oft-marginalized men and women who have tried or succeeded at killing US presidents. With its nonlinear narrative and mix of the blackly comedic with the too-close-for-comfort — one character delivers a drunken rant while dressed as Santa Claus before flying a plane into Nixon’s White House — Assassins offers such a sharp condemnation of American politics that it took three tries to bring the show to Broadway. The first attempt, its original 1990 off-Broadway outing, was stymied by the advent of the Gulf War. The second attempt was originally slated to open on Broadway in September 2001. It finally opened there at last in 2004.

Assassins remains a very necessary show, and the scathing “Flag Song,” the show’s original opening number, shows us why. Its narrator wryly breaks down the lure of the American Dream: “You think, ‘Why try?’ and you want to cry / Then that flag goes by, and you think, ‘That’s why: ’cause of that idea, that incredible idea.’” In the hands of national treasure Brian Stokes Mitchell, it practically becomes a cautionary tale delivered by Uncle Sam himself — of the glamour, and the danger, of America as a construct. —AR

“Finishing the Hat” is perhaps Sondheim’s most emblematic song, so the question wasn’t whether or not it would appear in this concert — it was who would get to sing it. And somewhat surprisingly, it went not to Mandy Patinkin, who originated the role of George on Broadway in 1984. It went to Michael Cerveris instead.

Cerveris has played George before, in an Illinois revival in 2004, but his best-known Sondheim collaborations are his work as John Wilkes Booth in Assassins on Broadway in 2004 and as Sweeney Todd in the 2005 Broadway revival. In many ways, he’s an ideal Sondheim actor: His voice is so velvety and rich, you feel as though you could wrap yourself up in it. But he’s also able to make his presence chilly and isolated in a way that’s perfect for Sondheim’s lonely, withholding heroes.

Here, gazing out of a window and staunchly refusing to make eye contact with the camera, Cerveris finds the aching loneliness that hides below George’s cold exterior. He’s isolated even from us — but look, he made a hat, where there never was a hat. —CG

“Someone in a Tree” from Pacific Overtures — Ann Harada, Austin Ku, Kelvin Moon Loh, and Thom Sesma

Sondheim once famously said that “Someone in a Tree,” from his 1976 flop Pacific Overtures, was the best song he ever wrote, and it’s hard to argue with him. The lush ensemble number, performed here by cast members of the 2017 Classic Stage Company production, takes the dry subject of the 1854 Treaty of Kanagawa between Commodore Perry and the Japanese shogunate and, instead of recapping it, turns the moment into a rich treatise on memory and historicity itself. Through the disjointed perspectives and fading recollections of a few unrelated bystanders to the event, the song explores the fragmentation of memory, showing us that the power of an event is often much more about the feeling and the spirit of the moment rather than the actual things taking place.

“Someone in a Tree” is also a beautiful look at the experimental range of much of Sondheim’s work. It’s a mini-version of Pacific Overtures itself: a very postmodern, meta-textual study of time and culture and the way that history gains meaning through incremental individual moments. It was a theme Sondheim and his librettist for the show, John Weidman, would return to again for his much darker 1990 show Assassins. And while both shows were challenging and controversial, each went on to become cult favorites and are now widely considered to be among Sondheim’s best musicals. When he was writing the libretto for Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda consulted Weidman specifically to gain insight into how to write such unreliable yet relatable narration into his own work. “Someone in a Tree” is a short master class in how satisfying such an unsatisfying form can be. —AR

“Send In the Clowns” is my favorite Sondheim song because of its ability to somehow tell the entire story of someone’s life in just four minutes. Sondheim wrote the song specifically for Glynis Johns, who portrayed Desiree in A Little Night Music on Broadway. It’s about a woman reflecting on the regret and disappointments of her life and realizing the painful truth of it all: If she had done something differently back then (in Desiree’s case, realizing she was truly in love with a man she previously rebuffed), they would be in a much more contented present.

“Send In the Clowns” isn’t meant to be splashy or a showstopper. It’s meant to be a quiet contemplation of a better life. And while she’s not Glynis Johns, Donna Murphy gave it the touching, somber dignity it deserved. —AAS

“Ladies Who Lunch” from Company — Christine Baranski, Meryl Streep, and Audra McDonald

Is there a more iconic quarantine mood than Christine Baranski, Meryl Streep, and Audra McDonald, all wearing white bathrobes and clutching enormous bottles of their alcohol of choice, slur-belting their way through “Ladies Who Lunch”? Of course there isn’t. We stan these three icons, and we hope and pray this means Audra and her immaculate range will be joining Christine and Meryl in Mamma Mia 3. —CG

“No One Is Alone” is Bernadette Peters’s traditional concert closer, and it’s only fitting that it brings this virtual Sondheim concert to an end, too. Like her Sunday in the Park co-star Mandy Patinkin, Peters chose to go a cappella, sitting alone in her apartment and appearing to blink back tears now and then. “I thought this might just be the perfect song right now,” Peters says earnestly as she finishes up, and she’s right.

Hard to see the light now. Just don’t let it go. —CG

"['Zeeshan Aleem', 'Alex Ward', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-26,SNL cold open: Brad Pitt plays an unusually candid Dr. Anthony Fauci,"In April 25’s Saturday Night Live opening sketch, Brad Pitt played an unusually candid Dr. Anthony Fauci, reacting to and translating several of President Donald Trump’s incorrect statements about the coronavirus pandemic.

Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and regularly appears on television alongside Trump during White House coronavirus briefings. In an appearance on CNN’s New Day in early April, Fauci jokingly said he’d like to have Pitt portray him on SNL — and Saturday, that came to pass.

In the cold open, Pitt’s Fauci sits at a desk in a study, sharing what he thinks Trump is really saying when he talks about the virus.

Pitt begins by saying he’d like to “thank all the older women in America who have sent me supportive, inspiring, and sometimes graphic emails.”

Then he starts to review Trump clips, beginning with one of a real-life Trump saying the vaccine for coronavirus will be coming out “relatively soon.” Pitt’s Fauci describes it as ... a bit misleading.

“Relative to the entire history of Earth? Sure, the vaccine is gonna come real fast,” Pitt says. “But if you were to tell a friend, ‘I’ll be over relatively soon,’ and then showed up a year and a half later, then your friend may be relatively pissed off.”

Another real Trump clip plays in which the president says: “We have done an incredible job ... It’s going to disappear one day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

Pitt’s Fauci is not convinced that this is a wise policy to bank on: “A miracle would be great. But miracles shouldn’t be Plan A. Even Sully tried to land at the airport first,” he says.

Pitt then reacts to a clip of Trump saying, “Anybody that needs a test gets a test ... and the tests are beautiful.”

“I don’t know if I would describe the test as beautiful, unless your idea of beauty is having a cotton swab tickle your brain,” Pitt says. “Also when he said everyone can get a test, what he meant was: almost no one.”

When a recent clip plays of Trump floating the idea of curing coronavirus by injecting disinfectant into the body, Pitt’s Fauci simply responds with a blank, slack-jawed face, before predicting that he’ll be fired because Trump promised that he wouldn’t fire him.

The sketch ends with Pitt taking off his wig — and breaking character, he sincerely thanks Fauci for his “calm” and “clarity” and thanks all medical professionals on the front lines of the pandemic response.

"['Constance Grady', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-25,"If you need quick comfort, try reading a cookbook like it’s a novel","Welcome to Vox’s weekly book link roundup, a curated selection of the internet’s best writing on books and related subjects.

We made it through another week! It’s time for a break. Here is the internet’s best writing on books and related subjects for the week of April 19, 2020.

The emergency Artist Relief fund has released its first round of 200 $5,000 grants to artists in financial need, Publishers Weekly reports. The fund plans to continue for an additional four rounds.

The US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this week that literacy is a fundamental protected right, one that public schools are obligated to fulfill. We next have to see if that ruling can survive the Supreme Court.

At Atlas Obscura, Isaac Schultz introduces us to the team of chemists who figured out how to recreate a lost medieval blue ink:

The team ventured into the southern, bleached-white town of Monsaraz to collect the fruit as per the manuscript’s instructions. The hairy plant’s fruit—about the size of a walnut—yielded a blue mixture. Careful not to crush the seeds, which the team realized jeopardized the quality of the ink, they identified the chemical compound that made the mixture, confirming folium’s identity on the molecular scale. It turns out folium is up with anthocyanins—the blue chemicals found in berries.

At JStor Daily, Matthew Wills recommends Marguerite Young’s enormous 1965 novel Miss MacIntosh, My Darling:

Perhaps fittingly for a cult success of the late 1960s, the book is a trip, literally and figuratively. The narrator, Vera Cartwright, journeys by bus across the Midwest, toward the hometown of her beloved nursemaid, the titular Miss MacIntosh. That town, the wonderfully named What Cheer, is in fact a real place in Iowa (pop. 646 in the 2010 census). King says that the novel, now almost forgotten, is “one of America’s most eccentric, incontrovertibly visionary, and incontestably original masterpieces,” akin to the work of an “outsider artist or art brut painter.”

Carol Ann Duffy has launched an international poetry project that seeks to create a “living record” of the pandemic, the Guardian reports. Here is one of the resulting poems, called “Garden,” by Andrew McMillan:

in the beginning

the dead like the first flowers

for Adam were few enough to name them

but soon they grew too many

the vast fields of them

At LitHub, Jason Boog delves into the ways writers survived the Great Depression, plus the recession of 2008:

The Crisis Generation. That phrase guided me through the next few years. I paid 50 dollars to get a copy of Newhouse’s out-of-print novel so I could show it to everybody I knew. Like some misguided missionary, I’d show it to people and say, “See? See? He’s talking about us!” His book felt like a bomb with a busted timer that had stalled back in the 1930s and had been stuck on a dusty shelf for 80 years, losing none of its dangerous potency. I wanted to fix the timer and blow something up all over again.

At the Guardian, Geoff Dyer has a nicely obscure list of funny books:

“Hysteria of cruel fun” is also an apt description of the bonkers world of Ivy Compton-Burnett. In scope (English upper-class households between the wars) and form (almost entirely dialogue), novels such as A House and Its Head and Manservant and Maidservant get by on the most meagre of narrative rations. Imagine the Wodehouse books, with Jeeves and Wooster stranded at the precise moment, in Gaspar Noé’s Climax, when the cast begin to notice that the punch has been spiked. Since this dread realisation can be expressed only within the clipped register of class and period, a tightly repressed mania holds sway. Relief takes the form of howls of laughter from the reader.

At Bon Appetit, Amanda Shapiro recommends reading your cookbooks straight through like regular books, and you know what, she’s right:

I flipped to a random page and read a sidebar: “15 Thirty-Second Ways to Jazz Up Plain Rice.” (“1. Stir in a tablespoon or more butter.”) Further down the page, I read a section called The Basics of Rice Pilaf. It was boring, but I found myself taking deeper breaths. On the next page, I read a recipe for Chicken Paella. (“Sometimes perceived as a major production, paella is nothing more than a combination of rice and something else.”) I read another sidebar, “17 Grain Dishes That Make Good Leftovers.” I flipped to one of the recipes: Stuck-Pot Rice with Potato Crust. I read the recipe and Bittman’s suggested variation (swap the potato for pita). I had no desire to make it, but I felt oddly calm.

And here’s the week in books at Vox:

"['Allegra Frank', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,This weekend's coolest concert is happening in Fortnite,"In 2020, you likely either play Fortnite or you don’t. The expansive multiplayer shooter video game attracted massive media attention in 2018 for its popularity with more than 250 million players of all ages.

All those eyes on Fortnite helped the game grab the attention of people with more clout than the average teen. Celebrities like Joe Jonas, Josh Hart, and Drake got in on the Fortnite craze, livestreaming with some of the most popular players in the game’s community.

Eventually, developer Epic Games started incorporating some of its famous fans into Fortnite itself, hosting live concerts and album listening parties inside different areas of the game’s world. Most memorably, DJ Marshmello’s live concert in Fortnite set the record for the highest number of people playing at the same time, with almost 11 million people checking it out in February 2019.

Travis Scott’s live Fortnite shows, however, are very different from the previous musical experiences the game’s had to offer. The rapper, also known as Kylie Jenner’s partner, is a big fan of Fortnite, and he’s celebrating the release of a new single. With everyone stuck inside right now, he’s probably been playing a lot more Fortnite than usual lately. So why not combine the music drop with the game?

Scott has hooked up with Epic Games for a unique virtual concert tour within the game. Since the night of Thursday, April 23, and through the night of Saturday, April 25, a giant avatar based on Scott is appearing in one of Fortnite’s areas (called “Sweaty Springs”) to perform his newest song, “The Scotts,” and a few hits from 2018’s album Astroworld. (Yes, everyone’s favorite, “Sicko Mode” was on the setlist.)

Travis Scott’s Fortnite concert experience is 10 minutes of beautiful surrealism

The event is billed as Astronomical, probably both in reference to Astroworld and the size of Scott’s avatar in-game. He towers over any player who gets the chance to enter the Sweaty Springs area to watch his character lip sync to the songs as psychedelic visuals play. (It’s good to note here that Epic Games temporarily removed the ability for players to kill each other or cause damage to the “concert venue” during the show.)

Anyone who shows up is treated to a surreal, 10-minute show, where Giant Travis Scott suddenly gains godlike powers to fling players into outer space, underwater, and a colorful series of dimensions. Fortnite fully becomes an Astroworld of its own during this special show, and it looks beautifully and shockingly immersive. And for every Fortnite fan who gets to see it in-game together at the same time, it seems like quite the unforgettable event.

All of these visuals are timed to the music, so Scott isn’t actually playing his songs live. But players who tuned in during his first show Thursday night could watch Scott experience his Fortnite show at the same time as everyone else over Instagram Live. (His 2-year-old daughter, Stormi, even briefly interrupted the stream.)

Fortnite is a free-to-play game that’s available on all computer and smart device operating systems, as well as every video game console. So if you’re a Travis Scott fan but also a Fortnite newbie, you should still be able to check out the show. A lot of people have already made the effort to turn out, with the first show setting the new all-time player record, as 12.3 million players logged on to watch the Travis Scott experience inside Fortnite.

But what’s most fascinating about Scott’s Astronomical experience in Fortnite is how it contributes to the growing genre of virtual, live “quarantine concerts.” Musical artists are unable to play live shows or embark upon planned tours due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, so they’ve been finding creative ways to bring their music to fans. Instagram Live and YouTube have both been popular streaming platforms, but musicians are increasingly turning to multiplayer games to host a special type of live show. There was a music festival in Minecraft, a listening party in Club Penguin, and now a show in Fortnite with visuals rivaling the trippiest Cirque Du Soleil performance.

There are just a few more chances to check out Travis Scott’s Astronomical show. The remaining dates and times are listed below — as is an archive of the first performance.

April 25 — Midnight ET

April 25 — 11 am ET

April 25 — 6 pm ET

"['Alex Abad-Santos', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,Americans tend to see disease as a personal failure. That’s a terrible way of thinking about it.,"For the last month or so, I’ve been reading about and following every pandemic precaution that health officials have prescribed — from wearing a mask and washing my hands multiple times a day to getting groceries delivered and staying six feet apart from everyone I see.

I’m a natural hypochondriac and live in a constant state of overreaction. But I also operate with the mentality that as long as I follow all these rules, I won’t get sick. And that’s a mentality I’ve recently learned can be helpful in protecting yourself from the coronavirus, but can also be counterproductive if sickness is thought about as a punishment for not following said rules.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, I’ve been talking to Anna Muldoon, a former science policy adviser at the US Department of Health and Human Services and current PhD candidate researching infectious disease and social crises at Arizona State University.

While our conversations have mostly covered lighter topics like sex and dating, they’ve all touched on one shared theme of blame, and the tendency so many of us have to view disease as a personal failure. It’s the inverse of the “follow all the rules and you won’t get sick” mindset: If you get sick, it’s your own fault for not protecting yourself the way you should have.

That mindset can be exhausting and mentally draining. But as Muldoon explains, American history, time and again, has shown that it can also be devastating when it’s used to justify ignoring communities like gay men during the AIDS crisis, or when it’s weaponized against immigrants and racial minorities — stories of Asian Americans facing racist attacks have risen during the pandemic. Approaching disease as a blame game or personal failure can be as harmful as the disease itself.

Alex Abad-Santos

So, disease as punishment or failure — sorry to be so bleak. Where do we start?

Anna Muldoon

I mean, here’s the horrifying thing. I would say that the idea of sickness as divine punishment goes way back. You can find that in discussions of the plague in Europe. It’s a really old conception.

Alex Abad-Santos

I mean, look no further than the Bible.

Anna Muldoon

Exactly. The plagues in Egypt are punishment for Pharaoh and for the Egyptians. And so, I think that is pretty embedded in a lot of Western cultures. I think some have moved further from it than others, but the fact that we had a National Day of Prayer [for Americans affected by the pandemic] indicates that at least some large portion of the US still sees disease that way. And Fred Phelps [the Westboro Baptist Church pastor who died in 2014] exists, and blamed homosexuality for AIDS, and said that AIDS is punishment for immorality within the country.

I’m dividing this history into two strands. One is the disease as punishment, and then the second one is individual behavior, because they intertwine in horrible ways, but they’re separate things that then twist themselves together.

Alex Abad-Santos

So if we’re talking about the US, specifically, and the idea of disease as punishment and something worthy of blame, what does that history look like?

Anna Muldoon

So, that idea has been present for a very long time, and you see it in the 1721 Boston [smallpox epidemic]. There are debates about whether you should inoculate people for smallpox because it’s divine punishment. You see it in New York in the 1830s and 1850s around cholera, with people asking, “Is cholera punishment for immigrant immorality?” — which obviously is also political, because immigrants become the people that they’re blaming for the entry of cholera, and also then blaming for their own illness for not behaving like the uptight Puritan leaders of the city — technically they were Dutch Reform, not Puritan by then. Just as uptight, though!

In the 19th century, really, you start to get this shift from punishment of a community to this idea of the early version of what we all call behaviorism.

Alex Abad-Santos

And that’s more about blaming sickness on behavior? And also thinking about getting sick as a personal failure.

Anna Muldoon

Right. It’s the behavioral turn in health discussions that begins to identify, in some cases helpfully, causes of disease that are controllable: heavy drinking leading to liver problems, stuff like that. But it’s also really focused on the idea that if people led good, clean, upstanding lives, they would never get sick. And that idea has really continued in America in ways that are sometimes useful: like smoking or eating food that isn’t good for us.

Alex Abad-Santos

In some ways, we’re not that far off than the way people throughout history have used gods and goddesses and folktales to explain stuff they didn’t quite understand. Do you think it’s so that people can put their faith in something like behavior, or the idea of divine punishment, as a coping mechanism? Do you think that behaviorism, in a sense, might make stuff easier to compartmentalize and cope with stressful or bleak stuff?

Anna Muldoon

Absolutely. So, I think in a lot of ways it is incredibly difficult for people to understand and cope with the ways in which a lot of diseases are random. Some diseases, like infectious disease, you come in contact with a person or an object that you get the disease from. Something like cancer is so often random, not always true with breast cancer — there are genetics there and with some forms of cancer, there are genetic predispositions — but a lot of cancers are effectively random to the best of our knowledge. And randomness is incredibly hard for people to cope with.

For example, when my stepmother had cancer, people sent her all of these things about how her high-stress lifestyle, or having anxiety, could cause stomach cancer. None of that is true. But they were very much like, “If you’re sick, you must have done something. There’s something in your life [that you can change].”

Alex Abad-Santos

That seems like it comes from a good place, but also yikes! But isn’t that our cultural mindset? “If you follow these rules, you won’t get sick.” And that fits a pattern with American culture in general: If you follow the rules then you will succeed, or be desirable, or be a good parent, or yeah, not get sick.

Anna Muldoon

There’s a book called The Protestant Ethic by Max Weber that talks about the ways that early Protestantism encourages this division of self from community, but also encourages a form of life where everything is controllable. I mean, there’s also weird stuff going on there where, like, man is supposed to control everything and yet predestination is real. So it’s complicated.

Alex Abad-Santos

It all just seems to go back to coping mechanisms. We all have our different ways, and all of history has had its different way, of coping with stuff that’s not easily explained. It’s easier to cope with something if you accept the idea that it’s something “I” did.

Anna Muldoon

Also, disease is frightening. It’s much easier if you can look at the other person and say, “They must have done something wrong. I don’t do that thing, so I’ll be safe.”

This logic is, of course, also used to stigmatize groups that have particular illnesses or have a particular disease. It has been used historically against Chinese Americans, against African Americans, against both originally gay communities and later African American communities with AIDS, against immigrant communities with cholera that were mostly Irish and Italian Catholic immigrants. There were all these stories about how communion wine causes cholera, because people are crazy.

Alex Abad-Santos

From a young age, my mom told me to stay away from communion wine. She’d give my siblings and me a look that said, “No. Don’t even try that. That’s so gross.”

Anna Muldoon

She’s totally right.

Alex Abad-Santos

Back to the behavior aspect. It can come from a place of good intentions, like getting people to wash their hands or live healthier lives, but it also seems to fuel some truly awful outcomes.

Anna Muldoon

Right. It has also been a tool for a lot of really, really ugly things. And it’s worth us having a cultural conversation about the ways that we blame people who get whatever disease for something that may or may not be within their control, and particularly for diseases that are seen as STDs.

AIDS is the classic example of all of this, and probably the most well-studied. A lot of the country was perfectly willing to completely ignore AIDS until hemophiliac children started getting it. And then it was a thing.

Alex Abad-Santos

I think I remember reading about Ryan White (a hemophiliac 13-year-old who was diagnosed with AIDS following a blood transfusion) when I was in grade school. I was Catholic, and that was the story we were allowed to read about AIDS. It wasn’t until later in college that I learned about the extent of the devastation.

Anna Muldoon

When I went to high school in New Jersey, we still had worksheets that had GRID [Gay-Related Immune Deficiency, the original name for AIDS] crossed out at the top with AIDS handwritten underneath it in the mid-‘90s, which was really horrifying, because we’re close enough to New York that most of us knew someone that had died of AIDS.

AIDS erased entire communities and worlds. The stigma of AIDS was so intense, and it was used as a tool to further marginalize gay communities, in particular, early in its discovery and its identification.

I’m saying gay, not LGBT, because it was in particular gay men that people went after during the AIDS crisis. So when AIDS became a thing in the public consciousness, it was attached to a community that was already stigmatized. And that made it in some ways very easy for people to make it a disease full of blame.

Alex Abad-Santos

I think when we talk about blame we often think about actions that are worthy of blame. But blame-worthy actions can even be a passive thing, like ignoring people who need help. There are probably some schools, like the ones I went to, where the AIDS crisis is glossed over. That shows the damage this mindset can do. What are we seeing so far with Covid-19?

Anna Muldoon

It’s important to remember that right now, Covid-19 stigma is a major problem and a growing one, but it is not being used in quite the same ways that it was during AIDS to fire people and stigmatize entire communities.

Alex Abad-Santos

Yeah. It’s very different in that it’s not as weaponized. But it’s still part of a xenophobic and racist dog whistle. The whole idea of calling it the “Chinese flu” or the “Wuhan flu” places blame for its existence on Chinese or Asian people.

Anna Muldoon

Absolutely. And I mean, early on [in the pandemic], out of pure happenstance, I had just been reading about and starting to write about the quarantine of Chinatown in 1905 in San Francisco, and how horrifying it was.

And I think it is important to remember, as we talk, the ways that Covid-19 is being used to stigmatize, exclude, and attack Chinese American communities, and of course, all Asian American communities.

The US has a long history of nastiness around diseases, in particular with the Chinese. This goes back to 19th-century views of Asia in general, but China in particular, and this strange fear that emerges at the end of the 19th century that there are so many Chinese people that they’re going to take over the world. There are all of these horrific novels [about that happening]. As a genre it’s called yellow peril literature.

But that kind of fear gets used to justify restrictions on the movement of Chinese Americans on the West Coast, and the Chinese Exclusion Act, and public health laws that target them. And then eventually, the quarantine of Chinatown, where they basically locked thousands of people into Chinatown with no access to jobs or food.

Alex Abad-Santos

I’m not that well-versed in American history and public health, but it seems like the common thread here is a blind spot. The history of just how hostile America has been to Chinese people, to gay people, to immigrants — we aren’t really taught this. And these actions are hard to conceptualize, I guess, if they aren’t directly affecting you or your community.

Anna Muldoon

It’s pretty much just been erased and people have forgotten. And I think that there are a lot of ways in which that is directly linked to the ways that America wants to pretend that racism is over and everything’s fine right now. And so they’ve erased the ways that public health and medical systems have discriminated against anyone, basically, that isn’t a white Protestant, for a very long time.

One of the things we do, a disservice to our current generations, and in ways of honoring the dead, is that we don’t talk about the ways these things have been horrible before, and that lets us forget them and make a happier story of America in a way that obviously excludes all the people that have been harmed.

But also, in some ways, that means we forget the lessons that we should have taken from those things, that we should be looking at those moments and saying, “We will never do things like this again. It is crucial that we build our systems and build a culture and build a national awareness in ways that no one could ever stomach that again.” You live in America right now, and you know that we have not managed to do that.

Alex Abad-Santos

Right now there’s a push in some states to open things up again — beaches, salons, restaurants, and other businesses. Do you think in these cases there’s a mentality that what’s affecting other people can’t affect me, because those people who got sick didn’t take the right precautions? Are people, again, ignoring the people this is affecting?

Anna Muldoon

In America, we tend to assign individual blame to avoid looking at structural issues. So by blaming the individual, or blaming the community, we avoid having to look at the ways our social structures, our economic structures, put people at risk and trap them in positions that make them more likely to get sick. Blaming those structural problems on the individual is a way to avoid having to acknowledge the structural problems.

One of the things that has been making me yell at the news recently is the discussion of how many black and Hispanic people have died from Covid-19, and the ways in which many of those articles are not acknowledging that these are long-term structural phenomena.

[Black and Hispanic death rates] are not [as high as they are] because those people are more susceptible, or because they’re doing anything wrong. That is because those folks have been historically excluded and discriminated against, and therefore are more likely, unfortunately, to be in positions where they still have to go out and work.

Long-term discrimination — whether it’s economic, social, medical — means that those communities are being put at greater risk by our social systems. And yet so many of those articles just hand-wave all of that away. And they’re like, “Well, maybe they’re more susceptible.” And that is not what’s going on.

Alex Abad-Santos

I was reading someone who tweeted, “Oh, maybe there’s more pollution in urban areas where these people live.”

Anna Muldoon

Seriously, the answer is long-term structural racism that has forced these communities into a situation where they are getting sick. And I think that in general, America does a lot of pointing at the individual to avoid having to look at ourselves and our national structures and our national values, and the ways in which they harm people and create danger for the people that are excluded. True for AIDS, true for any of the diseases that we’ve talked about, and true for Covid-19.

Alex Abad-Santos

So, I want to get to the bright side of this, to what you call “a culture of care and resilience.” What can we do today, on a personal level, to change the way we think about disease?

Anna Muldoon

I mean, obvious things that need to be said that I have no idea how to fix, like fight racism and fight for less structurally unequal systems. Those things have to happen in order for these differences in death rates [xenophobic attacks] not to exist. We have to fix our structures. If I knew how to do that, I would be doing it. I don’t know. I wish I did.

But I think that the first steps are, any time you see disease statistics where the death rates are different, try to dig into why that is. Don’t just say, “Oh, those people die more.”

Try to look at why and challenge your politicians, your reporters, your public health agencies to actually explain and look at what the reasons are, rather than doing the hand-waving away, whatever is going on at that moment. I think that’s crucial.

At the same time, cultural change has to happen both at the individual and at the structural level. So it is on every one of us to make sure that we’re taking care of the people around us, to make sure that we’re actually hearing them. And in this moment, that can mean taking care of the people in your house, taking care of the people in your community, making sure that if they can’t go outside, you help them. I think that real cultures of resilience and real cultures of care have to include building tightly knit communities.

Alex Abad-Santos

For me, it seems the issue is how damaging fear can be and then just how deeply it’s entrenched in our culture. And if we look at what that’s gotten us, there’s more to lose if we keep thinking like this.

Anna Muldoon

There’s more to lose.

Disease in some ways is a great leveler. Infectious disease can take anyone. The question is, does our society put some people on the front lines where the disease is more likely to get to them? Infectious diseases have killed everyone from kings to paupers. No one is magically safe. But that should mean that we’re interested in building a society where we have social and economic and health care structures that make all of us as strong and resilient as possible, rather than ones that only protect some of the population.

I have great hope that the social change that comes out of this will be an acknowledgment of the structural problems that we have in our society, because I think Covid-19 has made them really, really apparent. I can hope, right?

Alex Abad-Santos

I mean, you can hope. We can all hope, right? It’s just history tells us differently.

Anna Muldoon

Yeah, sometimes. After every infectious disease outbreak, there are some social changes, right?

Sometimes they’re good and sometimes they’re bad. But I think that if we all understand that social changes come out of situations like this pretty consistently, it gives us an opportunity to think about what this pandemic makes obvious to us, and what we need to push for to be ready for the next one.

"['Ezra Klein', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,"Madeline Miller on myth, nostalgia, and how power corrupts","Madeline Miller has written some of my favorite novels of the past few years. Her books — the Orange Prize-winning Song of Achilles and the New York Times No. 1 bestseller Circe, soon to be an HBO series — are brilliant reimaginings of some of the most revered texts in the Western canon. Miller’s also a trained classicist, a Shakespeare director, a Latin teacher, and a Greek mythology obsessive.

This conversation on The Ezra Klein Show is about story and myth, about how our conceptions of godliness and human nature have changed, about the difficulty of translation, and the resonance of superheroes. We debate whether Achilles is the worst and agree that anyone who loves language should read Sandra Boynton. Miller reveals how to train yourself to write a beautiful sentence and how to steel yourself to tell the stories you burn to see but that the canon has wiped out. And we discuss what character from the Greek canon most resembles President Donald Trump.

This one was a tonic for me. Hopefully, it will be for you, too.

Here’s a lightly edited transcript of part of our conversation, which we released this week on The Ezra Klein Show.

Ezra Klein

What makes The Odyssey worth reading today? Given that we can read all this current and modern literature, why should we read something written by Homer thousands of years ago?

Madeline Miller

What draws me to these stories is how incredibly fresh and vibrant they still feel. Technology has changed and culture has changed, but human beings and the things that we struggle with, the things that we love and fear, are all still with us.

When I look at The Odyssey, I see at one level the story of an exhausted war veteran who is desperate to get home to his family. And when he finally gets home to his family, he discovers that it’s much harder to re-enter his old life than he thought it would be. I think that’s a story that can echo down through the generations.

But I think we can even go a step further than that and say this is a story about longing for home. The Greek word for homecoming, which is what Odysseus yearns for through the whole Odyssey — is “nostos.” It’s where we get the English word “nostalgia.” It’s the pain you feel when you miss home. And I think we’ve all felt that way. We’ve all had those moments where we feel lost on the waves and surrounded by monsters and wishing for safe harbor. I just see so many universal human experiences. So it speaks down through the centuries.

Ezra Klein

Something I always find very affecting about the Odysseus story is that homecoming isn’t great. He spends all these years trying to get home, but in the end, it’s tragic anyway.

I think that speaks to the idea that you can spend all your life trying to achieve this one thing, and you think when you have it, you’ll be happy. But then the person you became to achieve it means you’re a person who can no longer be happy with it. You become so good at striving that even once you have achieved your goal, you can’t stop striving — and you just become more and more dissatisfied.

That bit of tragedy has always struck me as deeply wise.

Madeline Miller

Absolutely. Odysseus comes home, and I think he experiences both this sort of rush of being home but also alienation and dislocation. I always think about how sad it is that he misses his son’s entire childhood and young adulthood. When he leaves, his son is an infant and when he comes back, his son is 21. He’s missed out on all those years of his marriage. His mother has died while he was away. His father has gotten quite old and infirm.

So now, you’re back with the people you love, but can you connect with them? Odysseus was honored as “best of the Greeks,” the man who was the architect of the fall of Troy, who was honored and treated as this almost God on Earth. Then he was thrown from that into these years of suffering and then brought home again to a place completely different than the one he left. So I think it makes sense to me why he kind of loses it at the end.

Ezra Klein

This is going to be a bold generalization, but here it goes. When I think of the stories we are told in our culture, the modal story is “What if you finally got what you always wanted? Wouldn’t that be great?” And ancient Greek stories more like “What if you finally got what you always wanted, and what if it were terrible?”

There’s something really interesting in the difference between a culture that believes getting what we want will be the path to happiness and one that thinks it’s a lot more complicated than that.

Madeline Miller

One of the things about Greek mythology that’s so interesting is just how horrible the gods are. The gods are really not exemplars. You might aspire to have the kind of power that they have, but, for the most part, they aren’t virtuous. They’re petty and selfish. The fact that they have achieved this ideal situation of having all the power, eternal life, the ability to fulfill every desire has not made them good people. If anything, it has done the opposite.

That was something that I really wanted to explore in Circe: this idea of when you do get everything you want, when you do have absolutely everything, it doesn’t make you a good person, actually. It makes you kind of a terrible person.

Psychological studies have proved that that is, in fact, correct: When human beings are given ultimate privilege and ultimate power, unless they actively fight against it, [their] empathy immediately starts dropping. You start assuming that if I’m way up here, I must have gotten here because I deserve it. And therefore, everybody who’s down there, they don’t deserve it. So I’m better than they are, and therefore I can treat them terribly if I want to.

I think it’s so interesting that the human brain goes there and that the Greeks knew that, and they manifested that in their mythology.

"['Aja Romano', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,Now is the perfect time to discover children’s fantasy author Frances Hardinge,"There’s no better time than the surreal moment we’re living in to sample the works of one of my favorite writers, British children’s author Frances Hardinge — and particularly her eerily on-point 2012 novel A Face Like Glass.

In it, a girl with a dangerous ability explores a cavernous underground world without exit routes, filled with people wearing masks. The more she learns about her mysterious surroundings, the more she realizes that it may be up to her to wake up an entire civilization — for, as one character warns her, “It is dangerous to lock oneself away and lose track of what is happening outside.”

It’s a strange, surreal story with a wild child at its center — and like all of Hardinge’s novels, it’s a little wild itself. Since publishing her debut novel in 2005, Hardinge has received wide acclaim in her native country. She’s roundly praised for her lush writing style, unique story ideas, meticulous world-building, and, perhaps most of all, her irascible, addictive heroines. But outside of Britain, Hardinge is still rather obscure, maybe because most people still equate children’s fantasy with the behemoth Harry Potter and nothing more.

Hardinge’s fantasies, however, are sophisticated, intelligent, and wildly original, and many adults as well as children love them. The magical elements don’t announce themselves — rather, they thread through the background, deepening the landscapes of stories that feel very familiar. Hardinge’s novels are really about societies wrestling with huge questions of politics, rebellion, and social change. Best of all, they’re usually told through the viewpoint of the best sort of protagonist — an angry, obstinate girl.

This type of surly preteen rebel usually makes for a highly unreliable narrator — not because she’s deliberately keeping things from us, but because there’s just so much she doesn’t know about the larger workings of the fantastical world she’s in.

Neverfell, the heroine of Face Like Glass, is one of the strongest examples of Hardinge’s classic type of heroine. Her 2012 novel is the fifth of her nine middle-grade fantasies, and it is in many ways the weirdest of the lot. It’s also one of her most memorable, and in these times of quarantine, I’ve found myself returning to it and enjoying its odd allegorical fable more than ever.

A Face Like Glass is about privilege, power, and fomenting rebellions

A Face Like Glass is set within an underground society, Caverna, whose inhabitants are skilled artisans but who all lack the ability to display their emotions. To compensate, they depend upon the talents of Facesmiths, mask-makers who create highly ornate masks that display a wide range of human expressions.

In such a society, the ability to own numerous masks to display a range of emotions is a luxury shared by the privileged few. Meanwhile, the rest of the populace is known as “drudges,” members of a destitute and downtrodden workforce who can only afford one or two masks — meaning they can only display a very small range of expressions at all times. That makes communicating how they truly feel not only difficult but also dangerous.

Into this odd society tumbles the human Neverfell, wearing the unthinkable: a naturally animated face that reveals her every emotion. Worried her mask-less face could put her in danger, a master craftsman named Grandible takes her in and makes her his apprentice, keeping her away from the rest of Caverna. Neverfell grows up sequestered for most of her young life, with no memory of her life before Caverna, understanding only that her face is somehow different from everyone else’s — a terrible abomination.

To hide it, Grandible gives her a mask of her own. But he can’t keep her hidden away forever, and when she finally finds her way out of his caves and into the rest of Caverna (by following a white rabbit, no less), she topples a complicated, intricate series of dominos. Desperate to figure out who she is, Neverfell finds herself embroiled in political schemes, murderous plots, and a populist uprising, as she becomes the unwitting “face” of the outside world to a people who’ve nearly forgotten the outside world exists.

Hardinge’s books always lead to unexpected places, and the journey there is always stunning

If all this sounds like a preposterous premise, consider that Hardinge isn’t the only recent writer to play around with the idea of an underground world whose people are forced to mimic regular human emotions. In fact, Face Like Glass and Jordan Peele’s 2019 horror hit Us have more than a few things in common: They each posit an underground world inhabited by a class of slaves who are eventually shaken into revolt by the coming of a girl from aboveground. Her presence, and her ability to remember and communicate the freedom of the outside world, catalyzes their revolt and attempt to seek access to the world above.

Of course, Peele’s film is an allegorical horror movie built on the United States’ specific fraught relationship to slavery, while Hardinge’s novel is molded in the tradition of British children’s fantasy, where magic is a casual fact of the world. The focus is on children coming of age in an often savage and highly complex social system. Within this much different genre, Hardinge’s underground becomes an allegory for class inequality and the social conditioning of the oppressed. Take, for instance, the way she describes Caverna itself.

“Ordinary maps cannot work in Caverna, and that is not just because the city is not flat. Directions do not always work as they should. Compasses spin uncontrollably or shiver into fragments.” ... “I hope not,” whispered Neverfell, “because if I’m sane, then there’s something wrong with Caverna, something horrible and sick, and nobody else has noticed. If I’m sane, then we shouldn’t be sitting around talking — we should all be clawing our way out as fast as we can.” “Oh, I don’t think she’d like that,” the Kleptomancer remarked, with a hint of affection in his voice. “She needs us. Without us, there is no her, after all. She is the city, not the tunnels, and so she does everything she can to keep us down here. Sometimes I even wonder whether it is only possible to create True Delicacies here because she gives them their power, as a bribe to stop us leaving. When the Grand Steward declared that nobody was allowed to enter or leave the city, I believe he became her chosen beloved. I will tell you something else, though I cannot prove it. The city grows, and not just through the effort of pick and shovel. She has been stretching, spreading and contorting to make room for us all, and I think that is why geography no longer makes sense.”

It makes perfect sense to me that this novel has lingered in my mind during the time of the coronavirus. But my praising of Face Like Glass is also an excuse for me to pitch all of Hardinge’s many marvelous books. She likes to toss improbable story elements at the walls of her genre’s conventions to see if they’ll break or hold — and due to her ability to construct entire worlds around the strangest ideas, they nearly always remain intact. I’ve never read a writer more skilled at weaving unlikely, startling, or wholly bonkers plot threads together into beautiful allegorical tapestries. And I’ve rarely read a writer more clever at delivering stories packed with feral girls:

If you like Face Like Glass, consider also the superb duology Fly by Night and Twilight Robbery, a middle-grade historical fantasy bursting at the seams with wit and wordplay and revolutionary spirit. I’m also partial to the intricate horror fantasy Cuckoo Song. Or try The Lie Tree, perhaps the most critically acclaimed of all Hardinge’s books.

But regardless of where you start, please do yourself a favor and read Frances Hardinge. In an uncertain time, you deserve small certainties, and I’ve rarely been more certain that an author will find their way into your heart.

"['Eleanor Cummins', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Celebrity quarantine posts are inflaming tensions between the haves and have-nots,"In recent weeks, Anatasia Army, 33, has kept tabs on celebrity social media exploits from the safety of her Brooklyn apartment. She saw when billionaire David Geffen shared his hope that “everyone is staying safe” in an Instagram post uploaded from his $590 million superyacht. And when comedian Ellen DeGeneres compared quarantine to “being in jail.” Most recently, she watched House Speaker Nancy Pelosi inadvertently reveal in a TV segment that she owns two industrial refrigerators, each reportedly worth $12,000.

“As soon as I saw that number, I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, I could live on that,’” Army, a babysitter, says. While public displays of wealth have often elicited backlash, the coronavirus pandemic has changed the context almost overnight. A luxury kitchen appliance, Army says, “takes on a new tenor” when lines for food banks stretch for half a mile and the nonprofit hunger relief organization Feeding America estimates that an additional 17.1 million Americans may soon be struggling to eat.

The internet has provided many of us with a much-needed tether to other people and places in the midst of the pandemic, but social media is also playing another role: It has become a catalyst for anger as it exposes the growing chasm between the haves and have-nots. For every video call with a loved one, there’s accumulating evidence of unfairness as people in quarantine reveal their starkly different isolation experiences.

The quarantine is really canceling a lot of celebrities. They don’t know how to act! Rihanna, Lady Gaga and Cardi B are the templates. Just donate, have some fun on IG and quit acting like you’re uniquely suffering in your mansions. — Stephanie! (@qsteph) April 8, 2020

Amid a nationwide shortage of tests and personal protective equipment such as masks and respirators, some have used their privilege to their advantage — and flaunted the results on social media. As health care workers across the country resort to using ski goggles as eye shields and average Americans apply DIY mask patterns to old T-shirts, models like Bella Hadid and Naomi Campbell are posting photos in protective equipment that’s nearly impossible to procure.

Others, such as Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashian empire, have been tested for the coronavirus even without showing symptoms, while in other parts of Los Angeles, officials refused tests to people whose loved ones had died of Covid-19. Some fans are unfazed (“You are still freaking beautiful with a mask on,” someone posted on Gwyneth Paltrow’s selfie in a device that looked even more complex than the coveted N95), but comments sections reveal growing frustration. “[Y]ou better be donating any of the extra masks you have to nurses,” one commenter wrote on actress Kate Hudson’s photo in a surgical cover.

This is unconscionable, especially while people are literally dying of covid because they are in jail @TheEllenShow https://t.co/89zeafzOf4 — ‍♀️ Chanda #COLA4ALL Prescod-Weinstein ‍♀️ (@IBJIYONGI) April 8, 2020

The divide became more literal in recent weeks when wealthy out-of-towners began to inundate rural areas and vacation destinations, which typically have the least capacity for the intensive care beds many coronavirus patients require.

Idaho’s growing coronavirus hot spot emerged not in cities such as Boise, but in the sparsely populated Blaine County, courtesy of skiers from across the country who continued to flock to the slopes into March. That month, Airbnb reported a $280 million increase in year-over-year revenue in rural areas, while revenue in urban areas dropped by $75 million. Locals have pushed back on the influx of potentially infectious outsiders: Hawaiians begged mainlanders to stay away from the archipelago, and full-time Cape Cod residents tried to ban coronavirus carpetbaggers from viral “hot spots,” but it didn’t dampen anyone’s desire for escape.

Instagram influencers such as Naomi Davis have put faces to the phenomenon: Davis and her husband decided to “head out west” in an RV with their five kids after spending two weeks in their Manhattan apartment — and chronicled the choice on Instagram. But fans criticized Davis’s decision to prioritize her family over the public good. “This is not about you,” one stated plainly. “It’s choices like these that will continue to cost other people their LIVES, and make the rest of us who are actually following the rules stay locked in for longer. Not cool,” another commented.

Smaller disparities are manifesting on social media, too. As people score kettlebells and Nintendo Switch gaming consoles, both of which are sold out for the foreseeable future, they can’t help but share their good luck online. But even the basics, like the ability to stream Netflix’s Tiger King or log on to a Zoom dinner party, are out of reach for the roughly 42.8 million Americans who don’t have reliable high-speed internet. These adults have struggled to work from home — if their employers even afford them the choice — and their children have been effectively barred from continuing their education as school moved online overnight.

Inequalities like these have persisted for decades. But Covid-19 has quickly clarified the economic and social challenges millions of Americans face. Whether they’re Instacart workers on strike for better protections or Instagram users vocally disavowing the influencers they used to admire, people are no longer satisfied with luck, hope, or some future opportunity — they’re demanding a collective response to the crisis now.

“Everyone agrees that this is a moment of extraordinary social transformation, but no one knows what direction it will go in,” says Amber Wutich, an anthropology professor and director of the Center for Global Health at Arizona State University. But she thinks this digital class warfare, while ostensibly centered on tie-dye quarantine sweatsuits and sourdough starters, could be the harbinger of a more serious shift in how we see celebrities — and each other.

Diseases are often described as a great equalizer — they don’t discriminate. But “it’s not equal,” says Nükhet Varlik, an associate professor of history at the University of South Carolina and a historian of the plagues of the Ottoman Empire. Whether it’s the Black Death or the current coronavirus, infection rates and subsequent deaths vary along class and racial lines. While the wealthy could still succumb to infection, they can employ avoidance strategies the masses can’t. “There’s always this sense of inequality in disease,” Varlik says.

People with the means to leave have fled, often successfully, from disease. In ancient Rome, the wealthy retreated to their mountain homes each summer to escape malaria in crowded cities. During the 1665 Great Plague of London, King Charles II and his courtiers made haste for Oxford, which was otherwise closed to outsiders. And in 1854, three-fourths of London’s Broad Street residents deserted the area within a week of a cholera outbreak; only the poor remained.

Whether it’s the Black Death or the current coronavirus, infection rates and subsequent deaths vary along class and racial lines

Now the rich are headed to the Hamptons. “That’s a very, very long tradition, so it’s not at all surprising that it would happen this way,” says Walter Scheidel, a professor of classics and history at Stanford University. “It hasn’t really changed at all.”

But these inequities can seem especially stark in the social media era. “Creators and influencers in many ways have been made for this moment,” says David Craig, an associate professor of communication at the University of Southern California. “They have built careers over time by building fan communities and interacting with them in a way that not only gets them to hang out and spend time on these platforms, but to support them economically, through many different business models.”

How celebrities and influencers have approached their fan communities in the midst of a global crisis has differed wildly. Some people, like the singer Pink, who tested positive for Covid-19 and agonized over her son’s prolonged symptoms, and fitness influencer Amanda Kloots, whose husband was hospitalized with the virus, have worked to encourage fans to comply with isolation measures. The “bad boys” of the internet, like Logan and Jake Paul and PewDiePie, have simmered down, perhaps aware of everyone’s low tolerance for offensive or outlandish antics at present.

“And then you’re having a couple of examples where there are creators falling out of line with their community because they’re doing something that is considered deadly, and they’re being rightfully called out,” Craig says.

Arielle Charnas, an influencer with about 1.3 million Instagram followers, was at the center of one such storm. In March, Charnas called a doctor friend and, despite widespread shortages and strict testing criteria, was able to procure a Covid-19 test. It came back positive. Instead of quarantining in her Manhattan apartment, Charnas and her family moved to the Hamptons, carrying the virus with her to the coastal community. The public was vociferous in its disapproval.

“I truly hope you take a step back for a considerable amount of time and think of some fundamental changes you need to make,” one person commented on Charnas’s website. “You posting your cute little Instagram COVID19 adventure with your #volvo #sponsored is beyond TONE DEAF.”

The backlash that public figures like Davis, reality TV star Kristin Cavallari, and Charnas have faced could be dismissed as “cancel culture.” But Wutich, the anthropologist, says holding each other accountable on social media can be productive, whether the subject is racial or gender inequality or social isolation strategies. “We’re seeing [this] on steroids right now during the pandemic, but it’s always the case that those interventions on social norms have the ultimate goal of saving lives,” she says.

And, she notes, “Gen Z and millennials have learned that in a situation where they have relatively low social power, they can use collective action through social media to push back against social norms they find unacceptable.”

Some governments have exercised their power to enforce social distancing. In Norway, for example, citizens were banned from visiting their cabins so they wouldn’t place an undue burden on rural health care providers. Anyone who didn’t return to their primary residence would be subject to fines or imprisonment. But many places, including parts of the United States, have shifted “the responsibility for human health from the community, including the government, to the individual,” Wutich says. Now people are “running up against the fundamental insufficiency of this way of protecting health.”

The resulting angst is exacerbated by social media evidence of how dependent we are on each other — and, in particular, how dependent the privileged are on the poor. Megyn Kelly, evidently unaccustomed to cooking for herself, burned six pieces of chicken to a crisp and tweeted the results. Real Housewives star Ramona Singer, left to her own devices, used a toilet brush to clean the outside of her toilet bowl, as depicted in a video her daughter filmed from their Boca Raton quarantine. And Charnas was criticized, in particular, for bringing her nanny to the Hamptons, potentially exposing her to the virus. Charnas eventually issued a written apology and filmed a teary-eyed Instagram story. “We’re not bad people,” she pleaded.

The growing sense of economic precarity doesn’t help the sense of class warfare brewing online, either. Americans typically like to think of success as random, says Lisa Nakamura, director of the Digital Studies Institute at the University of Michigan. Other people flaunting their wealth on social media hasn’t typically made us angry because it’s viewed as aspirational content — we believe we could be the next one to strike it rich.

“But this [pandemic] showed that is never going to happen,” Nakamura says. When you see an influencer’s toned body, she says “You could think, I can get that body. When you see their clothes, you think, I can buy those clothes. But when you see their capacity to live wherever she wants, while other people are stuck at home, it’s ridiculous. And that’s not aspirational, because you don’t want to aspire to that.”

If the internet has been our portal to immersive digital environments, the pandemic itself may be a portal to a new way of living in the real world. In his book The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century, Scheidel argues that disasters such as war and plague have traditionally caused inequality to shrink, at least temporarily.

“There’s a lot of inertia, generally, in society,” he says. “You really need some kind of unexpected disruption to make people want to do something about it.” The coronavirus could offer such an opportunity. But sometimes disasters can result in the exact opposite outcome, says Ann Carmichael, an associate professor emerita at Indiana University and a plague scholar. “From the Black Death on, including the influenza of 1918, there is a powerful energy placed into making sure the people who were in power before the plague are the people in power after the plague,” she says.

No one is sure how the current pandemic and the resulting financial fallout will play out. The government may be able to suppress an economic tailspin. “But if for some reason [the recovery] turns out not to work, that would surely shatter people’s confidence in the system. or people’s sense of resignation that nothing could ever change,” Scheidel says.

Thanks to social media, that change may already be happening. While Army worries that “eventually people are going to probably hide these [luxuries] a little bit more” on social media, even as the real disparities persist, Scheidel sees the potential for substantive change. It’s easy to dismiss the antics of fashion influencers and celebrities — even the most off-putting posts are quickly lost in a rapacious news cycle — but Scheidel says the accumulating evidence of the enormous gap between the haves and have-nots could have real-world consequences. “There are real ramifications when people say, ‘Wait a minute, why can’t we have those things, too?’”

"['Sarah Khan', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,The era of peak travel is over,"Part of the Pandemic Issue of The Highlight, our home for ambitious stories that explain our world.

For years, I’ve perfected my personal travel routine: scrubbing my tray table, seatbelt, armrests, and screen before I triumphantly sink into a sterilized seat. I typically fly more than 100,000 miles a year, and I’ve come to attribute a lot of my general good health on the road to this fastidious in-flight choreography — so what if it’s placebo effect at play? When Naomi Campbell went viral last year for her far more meticulous approach to airplane sanitation, the internet responded with mirth and mockery. I responded with admiration — and envy for the breadth of her arsenal. Why hadn’t I thought of masks and gloves?

Of course, now lots of us are thinking about masks and gloves.

Hardly any industry is untouched by the Covid-19 crisis, but travel was among the first to be affected and has been dealt a particularly brutal blow. Barely a month after worldwide lockdowns and border closures effectively sealed off entire countries from reach, many are already looking back fondly on the halcyon days of travel. Until February, the pressing existential crisis was too much of it, in fact: Booming economies and growing flight routes made the world more accessible than ever before, flooding destinations like Iceland, Barcelona, and Tulum with more tourists than they could handle. Now, the existential crisis is, well, the industry’s very existence.

“It’s going to take so long for the demand to even come close to what it was,” says Rafat Ali, chief executive and founder of travel industry news publication Skift. As recently as two months ago, he says, Skift was reporting heavily on overtourism; now, its coverage has shifted dramatically, to tracking the rapidly changing milieu for airlines, hotels, and all facets of the travel industry.

Barely a month after worldwide lockdowns, we’re already looking back fondly on the halcyon days of travel

We’re still deep in the trenches of the coronavirus pandemic, so it’s impossible to predict when or how travel might resume, let alone whether we’ll feel comfortable traipsing around the world again with the kind of carefree insouciance to which many of us have become accustomed. The UN World Tourism Organization counted 1.4 billion international tourist arrivals in 2018, and, well before this crisis, had predicted 1.8 billion arrivals by 2030. With virtually all travel halted, recovery will take time. Ali is taking what he calls the long view, expecting air travel to return to early 2020 levels in five years, taking into account that the airline industry took three years to recover post-9/11, and two years to return to pre-2008 revenues after the recession.

Travel will be back — it has to be back, for too many livelihoods and economies depend on it. More than 10 percent of the global workforce is employed by the tourism industry, and from farmers who supply hotels with produce to drivers who ferry tourists around between excursions and beyond, millions of people rely on business generated by travelers. But the way we travel will undergo a dramatic transformation.

Sure, travelers are likely to adopt a disinfecting regimen that falls somewhere in between my own and Naomi Campbell’s on the sanitation spectrum (in light of recent events, she has since upgraded to a hazmat suit). But before the masses feel comfortable taking to the skies again, the classic road trip will be resurrected.

“Personal space becomes important,” Ali says. “Never, ever will we look at people who we thought were crazy, who were cleaning seats — we had a few of those people in the company we used to make fun of. Never again!”

Industry experts say technology will be a key tool in the revival of travel, with electronic passports and IDs, boarding passes, medical screening, and robot cleaners being deployed widely to limit physical contact between people and surfaces. Hotels, airlines, and especially cruises will have to determine how to give travelers personal spaces they feel they can control. And in the short term, driveable local trips to vacation rentals can ease shell-shocked travelers back into adventure.

“Airbnb-type places that you can disinfect yourself, especially in a more remote setting: I think those would definitely be the first step for us traveling outside,” Ali says. “Fear of humans and crowded places will be etched in our hearts for the rest of our lives.”

Jessica Nabongo, founder of travel firm Jet Black, became the first black woman to travel to every UN-recognized country in the world in October; these days, she’s spending more time in her Detroit home than she has in years. She says she will likely start taking domestic trips before international travel is safe to resume. “I think road trips are going to become a huge thing, especially in the summer,” she says. Like Ali, she fears that “there’s going to be a bit of corona hangover, with people afraid of going to festivals, being in loud crowds, going to airports.”

The coronavirus-induced worldwide financial crisis will also be a key factor in keeping travelers close to home, at least in the short term. “The economic impact of coronavirus will leave many people with less money to do non-essential travel,” says influencer and travel host Oneika Raymond. “I do think that more people will travel domestically, because it’s a less scary prospect and also often cheaper than a trip to a faraway land.”

Instagram feeds that have lately been filled with nostalgic throwbacks to global adventures will slowly start to be peppered with new images from those regional trips. “I think international travel is going to open very slowly,” says Nabongo. She believes that before entry to some countries, travelers may have to show negative Covid-19 testing, probably within the past 24 hours. “And I think that Europeans and Americans, for the first time, are going to feel what it’s like to have an undesirable passport — for a while, some countries, even if they do open up, may not allow the entry of American citizens or European citizens.”

Whether some travelers will be outright banned from entry remains to be seen, but it’s certainly expected that the footloose jet-setting many have come to take for granted is over “pretty much until a vaccine comes in,” says Ali — a vaccine that is probably more than a year away. And after that hurdle, travelers may need to show some sort of Covid-19 pass, much like the yellow fever certificate I keep with me for certain parts of Africa or South America.

Government-mandated quarantines on arrival or reentry could become the norm — making international travel out of reach for people with limited vacation time. And in general, travelers are much more likely to spring for health insurance, read the fine print of their travel policies, and pay close attention to World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines as they plot their travels.

Influencers in the travel space, whose identities and businesses have come to be defined by their jet-setting adventures, are taking these unexpected hiatuses as a chance to take stock, though many are still unsure what the future holds. “I’m essentially unemployed at the moment, as there’s no travel happening,” says Lee Abbamonte, a travel influencer who has visited every country. “Plus, we don’t yet know the public’s appetite for travel moving forward, as so many are losing so much money and jobs.”

Raymond is also waiting before making any plans for the future. “I’m no stranger to the art of the pivot and know the importance of not putting all of your eggs into one basket,” she says. “With that said, it’s still early days with regards to how greatly the travel industry will be affected, so I’m reserving any big pivots until the dust settles.”

“I’ve never been so grateful and aware of what a privilege it has been to globetrot until now”

In the meantime, she’s looking back on her past travels with a sense of gratitude. “I will definitely be more appreciative of the ability to travel freely and safely,” she muses. “As someone who travels for a living, it’s been very easy to take this lifestyle for granted. I’ve never been so grateful and aware of what a privilege it has been to globetrot until now.”

As we wait and watch, travel destinations will recover at their own pace. While Italy has been one of the hardest-hit nations, its legion of die-hard fans might help it rebound as soon as they’re able to return. “Italy is a country that our travelers really have an emotional connection with,” says Andrea Grisdale, who is chief executive of the destination management company IC Bellagio, and based in the hard-hit Italian region of Lombardy.

“We’re seeing a lot of people saying, ‘The minute the planes are flying, I want to be the first person on.’” But even if tourists return in droves, Grisdale predicts that the rural countryside will be more of a draw than Milan or Rome — in keeping with what might be a universal tendency for travelers to gravitate toward remote, isolated destinations worldwide.

Countries such as India have yet to reach a coronavirus case peak, and the long term implications are unclear, but its population density might turn off some travelers. “India is populated; that’s always been there,” says Shoba Mohan, founder of RARE India, a consortium of boutique hotels and heritage villas across India. “They might go back to a place like Italy sooner, and they’ll probably take a couple more months before they open up to the idea of India.” Metropolises such as Delhi had been popular for three-night stays, but now inquiries to more isolated regions like Ladakh, a scenic mountainous region in the north, may increase.

“I think what we’re going to see is more tourism to Africa, because it wasn’t hit that hard,” predicts Nabongo, referring to early coronavirus numbers emerging from the continent, though cases are still on the rise. But while the idea of heading deep into the isolated bush for a safari might be appealing, it’s too soon to tell what sort of effect the current lack of tourism might have had on the endangered wildlife. Tourism is a critical aspect of conservation efforts on the continent, and a long shutdown means empty parks and the loss of park fees.

“Animals-wise, I believe they will have the best time of their lives: no disturbance from vehicles and people, which will change their behavior in a way that nothing is bothering them,” says Hamza Raza Visram, northern Tanzania head guide for safari company Asilia Africa. “Conservation-wise, people will lose their jobs and will have to find other means of survival, and this might increase the poaching for bushmeat.” South Africa and Botswana have already confirmed an increase in rhino poaching since their coronavirus-induced shutdowns began.

For the airlines, tour operators, and mom-and-pop businesses that survive this shutdown, operations will adapt and evolve. Take a popular activity like ziplining, for example. Would you want to share gloves and helmets with others again, and are you prepared to wait while the equipment is sanitized thoroughly before your turn? Aspiring zipliners will likely be asked to spring for their own gloves and helmets, and sanitation costs might be factored into the price tag.

“Flights are going to be cheap because they’re going to have to convince people to go on planes, but costs of some things are going to have to go up because of the necessity of more sanitation,” Nabongo says.

It’s not an overstatement to say things will look very different for years to come — virtual meeting technology is already making corporations question the need for business travel; borders are being more starkly defined; retirees looking forward to traveling the world will likely tread more cautiously; and even young, intrepid backpackers raring to set out as soon as possible might keep hitting walls in the form of travel restrictions until vaccines are widely available.

But the universal grounding of global travelers has already had a positive impact on a planet wracked by the effects of climate change, and when borders do reopen, a more mindful approach to travel will likely be top of mind: fewer trips, longer trips, more meaningful trips. As we emerge from months of social distancing, we might be craving human connections — cooking with nonnas in the Italian countryside, or meeting craftsmen in rural Rajasthan, or a family road trip to Niagara Falls. “People call it the great reset,” Mohan says. “It’s creating awareness for a better kind of travel.”

"['Stephanie Foo', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,"My PTSD can be a weight. But in this pandemic, it feels like a superpower.","I’m in line outside a grocery store. A woman plucks an apple from the sidewalk bins, then turns to us and asks, “What’s going on?”

“Only 10 people in the store at a time,” a gentleman wearing a mask responds.

Her face darkens in fury, and she hurls the apple back before storming off.

I am unsurprised. Everywhere I turn, I see expressions of anger, sadness, and fear. People skitter, paranoid, away from anyone who passes them on the sidewalk. Online, I witness a man unboxing 25 pounds of heirloom beans, while people who’ve lost their jobs sob about not being able to get through to the unemployment office. Even friends with jobs lament their inability to work, because does advertising or teaching or editing a video about cool cars mean anything anymore? My most seemingly well-adjusted friends show up to our Zoom calls in bed, puffy-eyed, obsessive about the future.

I recognize this behavior.

For the first time, it seems, the entire world knows what it’s like to live inside my head. I have complex post-traumatic stress disorder, a form of PTSD that occurs from being subjected to trauma over and over again for years. Symptoms include trouble regulating one’s emotions, difficulty trusting others, and bouts of aggression, anxiety, and depression.

It’s a weird flex, but even as everyone around me posts about their panic attacks, I’m strangely calm these days. Turns out I’m an old hand at dealing with world-collapsing terror. I’m not disappearing into food or Netflix binges. Things that used to bother me, like tersely worded work emails, don’t faze me at all. I’m looking at scary things in the face and processing them by deciding which parts are reasonable to be frightened about and which parts are okay to let go of. Then I go about my day. I’m actually being pretty productive.

And I am finding myself uniquely equipped to help others who are struggling. Because of all the hard work I’ve done over the years learning to deal with my fear, I’m shockingly emerging from this as a valuable resource. I used to think my complex PTSD was a disability. In crisis, I’m recognizing that it is a superpower.

Lots of people who’ve experienced mental illness and trauma are in excruciating pain right now, I want to be clear. Social distancing may be triggering them or distancing them from ways they were able to cope: with friends, exercise, even AA meetings or in-person therapy. I don’t want to minimize their real, legitimate pain. But other, usually tender individuals are marveling at their ability to cope with a pandemic with comparative grace.

Part of our odd success may be because we’re used to this. We’ve dealt with everyday terror in our brains and bodies for years, and we pushed through to hold down our jobs, go to back-to-school night, make birthday cakes. And part of it is something else, a feeling that is harder to name but deeply healing. It is a long-awaited respite from shame.

It’s the summer of 2018, and I am supposed to be having a meeting with a hotshot businessman, but he is running quite late. I should be sitting in the fancy cafe, which serves mostly coffee but still has cloth napkins and leather chairs. But instead I am pacing outside, calling my boyfriend over and over. I am convinced he has killed himself.

This is nuts. I know this is nuts. We had a small fight that morning, and now he isn’t picking up his phone. Not exactly indicators that he must be dead. And yet. He always picks up. So I call. And call. Eventually, I hear his disoriented voice on the line. “Hey, what’s up?” he says. “I was taking a nap.” Embarrassment floods me. Oh, it’s fine, nothing, I say, okay, and I hang up. I take a couple of big breaths, and the businessman shows up. I smile brightly and grasp his warm, dry hand.

That’s my C-PTSD in action. And even though an incident of this magnitude is rare, it does make me catastrophize over small things. For a long time, I thought this was everyday anxiety and depression. But when I was diagnosed with C-PTSD at 30, I recognized I had something much more, well, complex.

Complex PTSD can occur when people are exposed to repeated trauma. Those likely to be diagnosed include prisoners of war or people who’ve experienced domestic abuse — my case was caused by child abuse and neglect. After I was diagnosed, the symptom list I Googled read like a biography: the tendency to trust the wrong people, the dismal self-loathing, the unhealthy relationship with one’s abuser. Altogether, the textbook definition of C-PTSD conjured an image of a very specific kind of person — cruel and unpredictable, exhausting to care for. They are far more likely to have alcoholism or addiction. They often can’t hold down jobs, are violent and impulsive. One book I read actually called traumatized people “a burden to themselves and others” and “a minefield many would prefer to avoid.”

This explained everything. I thought about all the times I had freaked out about small things and texted or called or knocked on people’s office doors, looking to them to help soothe me. They were calm. I was the messy burden. Because I didn’t see the world correctly, the way everyone else did. Everywhere I looked, I saw threats and fear and conspiracy where everyone else saw shadows.

Desperate, I dedicated my life to healing. I did yoga, hallucinogens, EMDR, saw a psychiatrist and four different therapists, meditated, talked to scientists, and wrote about all of it. I became a better listener than I was before, better at self-regulation and relaxation. I summoned a foundational, rewarding trust for my loved ones I never knew I could possess. I was happier. Still, whenever I slipped up and snapped at someone or had an anxious spell, a blanket of shame weighed on me, pulling me down to square one.

“There’s a difference between pain and suffering,” my therapist, Jacob Ham, told me. “Pain is the legitimate, healthy feeling you should experience after a loss or a mistake. Suffering is the shame that you put on top of it, for feeling the pain in the first place.”

“Yeah, but now I know I’m not supposed to feel the suffering, I feel extra suffering for feeling the suffering,” I returned. He rolled his eyes at me.

And then Covid-19 happened.

The first thing I noticed was that I went to the store before anyone else, so early that the checkout lady gave me a strange look as I hauled beans and pasta onto the conveyer belt. I got toilet paper when it was still on the shelves (a moderate amount, don’t worry). I started educating everyone in my household about proper safety protocols and wiping down our door handles. My family members sighed at me skeptically when I filled the basement with frozen waffles and canned tomatoes. But a few weeks later, when the hospitals started to overflow in our neighborhood, they were fully on board, and maybe even a little grateful. They certainly appreciated the waffles when bread was out at the store.

My therapist used to tell me that PTSD is only a mental illness in times of peace. Our bodies and brains are consistently attuned to war, so we look paranoid or hypervigilant in peacetime. But in times of crisis, PTSD is an incredible survival mechanism that our genius bodies created to help us adapt.

So in pandemic times, I’m not hypervigilant. I’m responsibly vigilant. My C-PTSD is helping keep my household safe.

I’m not the only one who’s experiencing this. I kept hearing from friends who struggled with other conditions like anxiety or OCD, who told me they too were surprised by their own level of chill. So I reached out to Dr. Ham to ask him about it. “Some people thrive in this situation because their symptoms, which were previously maladaptive in a ‘normal’ world, suddenly become advantageous,” he replied. “If you’ve always been suspicious of strangers, and felt isolated from others in some deep psychological sense, well, now that can be adaptive; everyone else is doing it. If you’ve had a germ phobia that was maladaptive, well, there’s no limit to how adaptive it is now!”

But I’m not feeling more stable just because I have a panic response that’s functioning well. That would be selling myself short. I’m also doing well because I’ve worked extremely hard to tame that response over the past couple of years, and that work is finally paying off. I’m no longer the one calling my friends crying and asking for comfort. I’m the one teaching friends how to find a therapist to Zoom with. I’m the one validating their feelings and telling them to be gentle with themselves, explaining the brain’s panic response and how that relates to what they are experiencing. I’ve had a lot of practice. I’m learning that in my long journey to heal from C-PTSD, I obtained valuable resources that it’s my responsibility to share. Turns out, I’m not a burden. I’m not a bad person. I can be a rock.

I still have days when the news is overwhelming and I sit at my computer sobbing, wondering how to mourn a loss of this breadth. But now more than ever, I feel capable of applying that sensitivity and compassion to my feelings. It’s not weak to be upset about thousands of people dying all around me, I know. It’s not paranoid to worry about what the world will look like a few months from now. Which brings me to the number one reason that I think I’m feeling better during this pandemic: I’m feeling the pain, but I’m not feeling the suffering anymore. There is no extra layer of shame. Because everyone else knows exactly what I’m going through, too.

“It’s so lonely having C-PTSD, and usually the reasons why you have it are private, personal, and intense,” says Susan, 33, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy. “A big struggle my whole life is feeling alone in having these feelings.” Her parents struggled for years to understand her mental illness. But while being quarantined, they expressed feeling helpless, depressed, and panicked. Yeah, Susan told them, That’s what it’s like to be me all the time. And something clicked.

“Even though they don’t understand it entirely, they’ve come closer to understanding it. And that’s an experience I’ve struggled for decades to convey to them,” she says. “It’s not something I would’ve wished on anybody, but being able to articulate my past experience in ways where I feel understood — it reduces a lot of shame.”

Shame, self-punishment, and negative self-talk keeps us feeling isolated from others and elevates the brain’s already activated panic response. For me, the added layer of shame sometimes kept me triggered for days instead of hours. Without shame, C-PTSD is a force. Depressive moments are hurdles throughout my day, but I use calming techniques and clear them. Then I can see C-PTSD’s strengths: empathy, kindness, love, good advice, an ability to calm those in crisis.

So here’s my advice to the rest of you, those who find yourselves in our shoes for the first time: You’re not losing your mind. Your brain is simply trying to protect you. Fear floods your brain with stress chemicals, which prepare you to run or play dead or eat more. These also reduce activity in your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain that processes logical thinking, decision-making, and moderation. That’s why you may find yourself acting erratically, covered in Cheeto dust.

Basic mindfulness techniques can reduce the amount of stress chemicals your body produces and shut off the part of your brain that keeps repeating negative narratives. There’s evidence that shows that reading bad news exacerbates these responses, so if you can, limit your input. And reach out to others for help. Maybe even us. I’m happy to be able to say to you: Needing help doesn’t make you a burden.

People talk about “after this is all over,” if and when that ever is. After this is all over, we’re going to eat so much restaurant food. We’ll throw huge parties. And we won’t be alone and afraid anymore. Which means that people with mental illness might go back to being odd, jumpy ducks.

Of course, more of us might be anxious than before Covid-19 struck, because it may have triggered difficult things in many people. Suicide hotlines are overwhelmed. A study in China reported that up to half of health care workers were experiencing mental health issues. Essential workers probably have struggled as well. Domestic abuse cases have risen worldwide.

These traumas don’t just go away in the light of day. They’ll take time to heal.

So I hope that enduring this terror will allow society to empathize with what those who struggle with mental illness feel like. I hope it will allow us to destigmatize mental illness and see the value in mental health care. I hope it recognizes that overactive brains have value in trying times.

And I hope that some of us with anxiety, OCD, and PTSD remember a time when we were powerful. I hope that when we cure Covid-19, we are also able to finally cure our shame.

"['Brianna Provenzano', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,6 people on what it’s like to be unemployed right now,"No corner of the global economy has been left untouched by the coronavirus’s rapid spread.

In the United States, jobless claims have soared past 26 million, pushing the country to the brink of an economic crisis not seen since the Great Depression. Experts continue to warn that despite a valiant global effort to “flatten the curve,” the virus could reemerge with renewed vigor just in time for flu season in the fall. Without a vaccine, it seems increasingly likely that economies around the world will continue to stall, and workers are poised to bear the brunt.

In response to the economic ruination, US lawmakers passed the CARES Act — an economic stimulus package designed to offer badly needed relief to individuals, large corporations, and small businesses alike. But a rocky rollout of the benefits, coupled with an overwhelming surge of new applications choking unemployment offices around the country, has left millions of workers in the dark, unsure when or even if help is coming.

Many of the newly unemployed people that Vox spoke to said they would be willing to take up work deemed “essential” — checking out groceries, driving ride share, portering at hospitals — if it meant being able to keep up with their bills and sustain their livelihoods.

“If I do catch [the virus], it’s going to be a bit worse for me, with asthma, than others,” said Mark Deeks, a 35-year-old sports analyst living in England. “But I’ve thought about that and about whether that would limit what I would be prepared to do, and the reality is no.”

Others, like 49-year-old administrative professional Thomas Inskeep, stressed the toll sudden joblessness has taken on their mental health.

“Some days I’ll get in the car and drive for half an hour, just around the roads in my town, in my neighborhood,” he said. “It’s only a couple of miles, but at least that way I’m getting some fresh air, some sunlight.”

Below are some of the stories of the newly unemployed, condensed and edited for clarity.

“I’ve always been a very self-sufficient person, and maybe it’s just my pride, but I want to be able to take care of myself and others”

Haley, 23, barista living in Tampa, Florida

I’ve been laid off from the craft coffee shop where I work for about a month now, and I can’t really say I’m surprised; coffee is a luxury product, and it’s not like I’m an essential worker. This is the first time I’ve been unemployed since I was 18 and fresh out of high school. The coffee shop actually does have another location that’s still open, but they didn’t offer us any work there, so that hurt a little bit.

I’ve applied to over 70 jobs since then — I have experience in animal hospitals and I’m a pharmacy technician as well, and then just administrative stuff. Pretty much just anything I think I’d be pretty competent at doing I’ve tried for, and it’s just been rough.

It’s been pretty weird to be out of work; it gets to you slowly. I’ve always been a very self-sufficient person, and maybe it’s just my pride, but I want to be able to take care of myself and others. To have the rug pulled out from under you, to have to rely on others … it hurts.

Florida has a really shitty unemployment website, and I tried for over two weeks to get benefits online — waking up at 3 am, staying up until 5 am, doing it in the middle of the day. The website will constantly kick you out, so I ended up printing out the paper application and sending it in about a week and a half ago. The system is totally overloaded, and they’ve admitted to that.

I did get my stimulus check, so that helps a lot to make sure I can still pay for my car and car insurance, because I live in a state where that’s required, but realistically $1,200 will last me maybe a month between rent and bills. I actually moved in with my boyfriend to help reduce the cost of rent because of the pandemic. It was planned for down the line anyway, but it was just like, well, there’s no better time than now.

The coffee shop management also started a GoFundMe for employees, but it hasn’t gained too much traction. I have a lot of mixed feelings about it .... full disclosure, I don’t have a lot of trust in my employer, the company that I work for. They didn’t even initially tell us about the GoFundMe, we just looked online and were like oh, that’s weird, why would they start a GoFundMe without telling us about it? Some of us are worried that we’re not even going to get the funds they’ve raised.

“I occasionally have anxiety attacks and panic attacks”

Thomas Inskeep, 49, administrative professional living in Santa Cruz, California

It’s funny, in some ways I’m actually maybe better suited to deal with this because in the last few years I’ve actually dealt with quite a bit of unemployment. In 2017, I missed quite a bit of work because I was dealing with some pretty severe depression, and I was unemployed for parts of 2018 and 2019. That was really, really rough, and I ended up having to do a GoFundMe — no one wants to do that.

I had just started my most recent role through a temp agency at the end of February, an administrative role at a food distributor that sources organic food. I absolutely loved it. About a week and a half in, I was already getting a little nervous about going into work because since I have diabetes, I’m immunosuppressed, and they have an open-plan office. About the second week of March, they finally said they were moving to work from home, but I wasn’t able to perform my role from home because so much of it was dependent on me being physically in the office. At that point, no one was even wearing masks yet. So I said I didn’t feel like I could continue going in. I spoke with the temp agency and they were supportive and understanding and told me to apply for unemployment. So I did that, and my last day of work was March 13.

Through the additional unemployment benefits recently approved under the CARES Act, I’ll get an extra $600 each week through the end of July. So this week when I got unemployment, I actually got an additional $1,200, which is massive. I’m getting less than $300 a week in unemployment benefits because my last couple of jobs haven’t paid particularly well, so that money is an absolute lifeline to me. I wasn’t able to pay my bills before this.

I live in the Santa Cruz Mountains, not in a metro area, and I normally love it. But right now, it’s brutally isolating. Since I live with both depression and anxiety, I saw a psychiatrist through my old insurance who would prescribe me Xanax as needed — I occasionally have anxiety attacks and panic attacks. But I’m low on it now and I can’t get more because I’m not her patient anymore.

To be honest, for anxiety I’ve been self-medicating with booze. It’s funny, I’m not a huge drinker in general and I had basically quit drinking once I got diagnosed with diabetes, but I have done more drinking in the last month than I have at any time of my life since college. It’s kind of like, well, I have a very limited number of Xanax, so I need to reserve those for emergencies — like the last time I went to the grocery store and people weren’t social distancing. That requires a Xanax! But otherwise, I’m using liquor to cope.

“Packing up and moving in the midst of a lockdown is not easy to do, but I did it because I had to”

Mark Deeks, 35, NBA sports analyst living in England

I work in and around the NBA, which is very hard to do in the first place as an Englishman, and the NBA was one of the first dominos to fall in what’s turned out to be the closing of the entire world of sports, essentially.

I was mostly working for Sky Sports, the NBA partner in this country, which is our equivalent of ESPN, but only on a freelance basis. As soon as sports ended, they stopped all freelance contracts. It’s fair enough and I don’t begrudge them that, but due to the nature of zero-hour freelance contracts, I only get paid if I work, and there is no work.

I was living just outside of London, which is still one of the priciest areas in one of the world’s most expensive countries to live in. But I couldn’t afford to stay there, so in the midst of this lockdown, I’ve had to pack up and move to a place in the middle of absolute nowhere, a pensioner’s retirement village of all places. It’s the British equivalent of Florida, except without the sun.

Packing up and moving in the midst of a lockdown is not easy to do, but I did it because I had to — I haven’t got any income. We’ve got more in the way of a social safety net than the US does, to the point where it’s gotten very complicated and convoluted how many avenues there were to apply for assistance. They ended up consolidating them into one, something known as universal credit, and that’s essentially the unemployment benefit equivalent of less than 100 pounds a week. So those who have been furloughed, you get 80 percent of your salary, but that doesn’t apply to me because I wasn’t salaried.

The supermarkets have been hiring across the industry right now, driving — I would do anything for work right now, to be honest with you, and it’s not gone well so far. As an asthmatic, I’m a little bit worried about the virus, because if I do catch it, it’s going to be a bit worse for me than others, but I’ve thought about that and about whether that would limit what work I would be prepared to do, and the reality is no. If I can be of some use, I will do those things.

I wouldn’t say I’m riddled with anxiety, just because I’m a bit resigned to never having control — I’ve never had control over this career because it’s so stop-start, it’s so high turnover. The changing nature of the media landscape has affected me, and that is constantly anxiety-inducing, so it’s not dramatically different, in that respect. It’s always a struggle — you’re bouncing around from whoever will take you to whoever will take you, strike up a good relationship, but then things close down, someone leaves, it turns out the money isn’t there. It’s a difficult business that I’ve chosen.

“How can I pay for electricity or rent if I’m only making $81 a week?”

Aidan, 25, retail worker/custodian/cook, living in Missouri

I worked two part-time jobs that rolled around to be about full-time hours, one for a local charity that benefits abuse victims and one for a retail store at the mall. So I’ve had two experiences being furloughed!

The retail store very quickly took me off of the schedule about mid-March, and about a week later, the mall stores all started shutting down one by one. A week or two after that, I had to do a conference call with everybody in the district from that retail store. We were told that everybody was furloughed, en masse, from that call on. The company did pay us two weeks’ worth of money, but it averaged out to be only about $150.

I was also working at an abuse shelter that also ran a thrift store, where I would help out. I had been there for about three years, and suddenly I was furloughed — again, the reason was basically, “We don’t need you in, we have no foot traffic, we don’t need an extra person.” My boss told me that I could start cleaning the shelter as a janitor at the day care that the shelter operates, because it’s very important everything the kids use has to be sanitized. After about a week and a half to two weeks, they furloughed me from that, because they couldn’t keep paying a separate custodial position, even though it’s essential work.

Within the next few days I started the unemployment process. It was tricky for me; the directions were not clear. Before the CARES Act went into place, even though I was working two jobs, pretty much full time, it would say that I was only eligible for $81 a week. That stressed me out because I have bills, I have an apartment, and if I don’t have much of an income, how can I pay for electricity or rent if I’m only making $81 a week?

Then, through connections that I have in town, I heard that there was a cooking job opening up a couple of towns over, about 10 miles away, at a retirement home. That’s the new job I’ve picked up, and it’s of course completely different from the retail jobs and helping people at the abuse shelter that I was used to. They’re really understaffed and they badly needed the help.

At first, I was really just rolling with the punches, that’s the type of person I am; things happen and I adjust on the fly. But within the past week, starting a new job in a new field I’ve never done before, for very long hours, and thinking, “If I don’t have this job, I could be homeless, and I don’t think I can do this job” — I just broke down.

“A lot of DJs have been doing live sets on Instagram. ... It’s kind of fulfilling people creatively, but financially it hasn’t been the best”

Caleb, 24, DJ living in Brooklyn, New York

I’ve been DJing for, like, three years now, and for the past year it’s been pretty close to full time. I heard directly from some of the spots I play that they were closing down due to the virus, but to be honest, [New York Gov. Andrew] Cuomo shut down the bars and then there was kind of just a general understanding that the gigs weren’t going to go on. Some places reached out and said, “We’re shut down, we’ll let you know when we’re back,” but for the most part it was just unspoken.

I was very anxious. My initial reaction was to check my bank account to see how much money I’d saved up. I’ve been DJing more and more full time, so it’s completely what I rely on. I did file for state unemployment benefits, maybe the second week after everything got shut down, and I got approved for unemployment, but it was, like, $173 a week. It’s something, but it isn’t going to help very much. There was also a DJ email chain going around with a bunch of relief funds to apply for. I’m very grateful for the people setting up these funds, but it just seems like there’s not enough to go around. Between DJs and bands and musicians and comedians and actors, there are just so many creatives out of work that are trying to tap into these funds and get some help.

A lot of DJs have been doing live sets on Instagram, and I’ve done a couple of those and asked for donations, and I actually got a decent response. It’s kind of fulfilling people creatively, but financially it hasn’t been the best. I’m going to see what I can get from unemployment and from the government, and if it’s not enough I guess I’ll drive for Pizza Hut or do bike deliveries or work at a grocery store. I don’t mind too much, and I know people my age aren’t at high risk.

I worry about the community — DJs are a pretty big part of nightlife, but they’re an additional cost for bars, and I’m just thinking about some of the places that aren’t quite as profitable and can barely afford to book DJs as it is. What if it’s even harder to book us in the future? A place like Pianos in the Lower East Side should be fine, but a lot of the smaller bars, which are the gigs I’m doing a lot of the time, might not have enough income. I’m definitely worried about it and pretty uncertain about how it’s all going to pan out. I’m trying to keep high spirits, but it’s a little hard.

“I felt betrayed”

Vina Hutchinson, 63, researcher living in Maryland

Everybody on the DC team got an email asking us to log in to this remote meeting, but I did not foresee the termination coming. I worked as a researcher based at the Library of Congress, for a third-party company with clients that liked certain topics researched. They let the entire DC team go — five people — so it wasn’t just me. They did say that when we got out on the other side of this we were invited to reapply for our jobs, but you know, that’s no guarantee of a job. My degrees are in journalism and history, and those aren’t really fields that have a lot of job prospects.

My first reaction was that I felt betrayed. I’ve worked for this company for almost three years, I’ve worked really hard, I made sure I was diligent about working 40 hours a week, about meeting deadlines. … I get that they needed to temporarily let us go for business reasons, but to just terminate us outright, was, I think, a little unfair.

They offered us a pretty good severance package, and I’ve just been waiting to get that before I apply for unemployment. Unemployment only lasts for so long, you know, so if I have money in the bank, why would I apply for benefits now when I’m going to need those down the road?

I’ll be applying for government benefits for the first time this week. I’m a little apprehensive because you’re reading a lot online about people having difficulty navigating the system. Everybody online says to apply in the middle of the night because the unemployment websites are more likely to let people on then. I’m also taking the DMV approach — never go to the DMV on Monday or Friday; you have to go mid-week.

Between my severance and unemployment, I’ll probably be okay on rent until the end of July, possibly August, but I’m not sure after that. By August 1, my severance will have definitely run out, and the $600 weekly supplement from the federal government ends at the end of July, so if I don’t have full-time employment by then, I’m going to have to look at what my options are.

I live with my adult daughter. She’s been fine; she actually just finished a school program in December and was job-hunting when all of this hit. New graduates don’t really have the option of unemployment, so we’re both just taking things one day at a time and reminding ourselves that we’re in this together.

Right now, while I’m stuck at home waiting for things to open back up, I’m using it as a time to explore some of the other ideas I’ve wanted to do, like starting a history newsletter. It helps with not feeling anxious, it sort of takes your mind off of things — rather than sitting back and thinking, “Oh it’s a pandemic and it’s so horrible I’ve lost my job,” just sort of thinking, “Okay, that chapter of my life is over — what’s next here?”

"['Rebecca Jennings', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,My quarantine cat hates me,"I spent the majority of my first two weeks of quarantine, just like many of you, on Petfinder.com. This is not a presumption; I know because Petfinder told me that its traffic increased 43 percent and adoption inquiries jumped 116 percent in the second half of March. Remember March? It was right around the time many people were starting to realize they were about to be spending a lot more time at home, where it suddenly felt very empty.

I had always tortured my parents, who did not want a four-legged creature anywhere near our house, by begging for a cat, or a puppy, or anything more sentient than a plant. Ultimately, with no actual bargaining chips, I settled for a freshwater tank of 10 neon tetras, all named after famous ’90s figure skaters. When we moved, my dad flushed them down the toilet, to the great ice rink in the sky.

So when my boyfriend and I finally moved into our own Brooklyn apartment in early March, cat adoption was at the top of my to-do list, after “buy a couch” and “have a very frank and serious discussion about what counts as ‘clean.’”

We were not planning on spending the majority of the month quarantined there, but one of the benefits of working from home is that no one can see that you have 25 open tabs in your browser filled with pictures of Laurie, an “affectionate, attention-seeking seven month old kitten looking for her FUREVER home,” or a tortie called “Gorgeous May” described as “slightly shy at first but turns into a LOVEBUG before you know it!!!” (All online cat descriptions sound like this, it’s incredibly dorky and very charming.)

You know what happened next. Things started to get bad in New York, and then bad everywhere else in the country, and then really bad in New York. Suddenly I happened to be adopting a cat at a time when thousands of other people were looking for something to keep them company during a certain “uncertain time.”

It had become a rare gem of good news in 2020 — “Newest Shortage in New York: The City Is Running Out of Dogs to Foster,” read one of such Bloomberg headlines. Animal shelters across the country were suddenly overwhelmed by applications to foster and adopt cats and dogs, even in places with traditionally low human-to-pet ratios, like New York City. Now that animal shelters had limited hours, many even agreed to foster after just one virtual FaceTime or Zoom call (sometimes also called a “meow meet”; again, animal people are corny as hell).

“At any given time we have over 600 animals in our care and right now we have less than 100, if that’s any indication of how it’s going,” says Katy Hansen, communications director for the Animal Care Centers of NYC.

“We put a call out for fosters on March 13, when everything kind of was really starting to hit full steam,” she says. “All we knew was that we needed to get as many animals out as possible because we didn’t know how this would affect our staff. We thought we would get 50 applications. We got 5,000.”

Not everyone is suitable to take in a foster animal, of course. Hansen jokes that “4,999 of those applications were for teacup poodles that are hypoallergenic and get along with kids and cats,” but the organization was still able to place 280 animals in foster homes that week.

This isn’t how animal shelters expected the pandemic to go. “We thought people were going to bring their animals in and then run for the hills,” Hansen says. Instead, it opened up an entirely new demographic of potential pet fosters: “The people that were filling up the applications were primarily millennials who lived with roommates. That’s not a demographic that we usually see coming forward to foster, because they’re working and they live with three people.”

The ASPCA, meanwhile, has seen a 500 percent increase in applications through its New York and Los Angeles foster programs since March 15, according to president and CEO Matt Bershadker. In Kansas City, a good day for the KC Pet Project animal shelter is getting 10 pets placed in foster homes, but it received 250 applications in the span of just a few days. So many people applied to foster animals through the Wisconsin Humane Society that its website briefly crashed.

I submitted one such application to countless local animal shelters, but knew my chances of hearing back would be far lower than normal considering the circumstances. It was a few weeks into the search, though, that I came across an adorable tortoiseshell kitten named Aubrey on Adopt-a-Pet.com (where daily traffic has increased 60 percent and inquiries have doubled, according to the site).

After going through the now-familiar slog of confirming that, yes, my landlord was okay with pets, and no, I had never surrendered an animal, and here are two people that can attest to my ability to keep a small thing alive, the tiny mom-and-pop organization that had rescued Aubrey sent me the text I’d been waiting for: “Hello rebecca congratulations your adoption application has been approved pls let us know what evenings after 7 works for you to meet the cats thx.”

The rescue shelter had an extremely wonderful setup for anyone hoping to choose the best possible cat for them: I’d pick out eight of the available cats on its website and would get the chance to meet them all inside an adoption van. The following evening, I put on a face mask and met Luis (not his real name) in his driveway. I was at the home of a stranger, alone, at 9 pm, 20 minutes away from my apartment or anyone I knew, but it was the most exciting place I’d ever been. My cat was in here!

Lined up in little crates, all eight of them were perfect, but two were more perfect than the others: a white female with gray spots I silently named Edelgard, after a character in a video game I had become recently obsessed with, and Hubert, the tuxedo male next to her, named for Edelgard’s slightly evil and very goth second-in-command. (Luis told me that Edelgard had been recently returned because she had been kind of a nightmare, and so I took the hint.)

When I picked up Hubert, though, it was all over. Not only did he have the softest fur and the prettiest facial markings I’d ever seen on a cat, but he loved me. The other cats were cute, but Hubert was mine.

A few days later, he was. Luis arrived at our apartment with food, litter, and a giant cage that held Hubert. We let him out; we took pictures. I held him some more, my very own cat, the furry thing I had wanted for an entire life of settling for inch-long tropical fish and other people’s pets.

Then Luis left. I have been around stressed-out cats before; I know what they do. They hide — for a few days, sometimes. “Dogs love you, cats tolerate you” is a thing that dog people like to say as an insult and cat people like to say as a brag.

For the first few days, Hubie barely tolerated us. He finally ate and used the litter box after the third day, while we were asleep. From morning through the afternoons, he’d burrow on a small ledge behind the couch, where I’d sit and work to try to let him get used to the smells and sounds of a new apartment. It was normal in the beginning; it was normal for the first week, I kept telling myself.

“He’s broken,” joked my boyfriend, and then we got into a fight.

With each day I’d started to spend more and more time reading advice columns on websites with titles like “The Way of Cats” and “Cuteness.com,” all of which told me to be patient, and luckily, cat people tend to be the sort who love giving advice. The lady at my local pet store recommended a particular brand of treats; one of the dorky websites suggested playing classical music to drown out scary noises.

The Vox Media cats-specific Slack channel said to make sure he sees me filling his bowl every day so that he associates me with food. Perhaps the most useful piece of perspective came from one of my coworkers, who said, “Cats are fickle little bitches and we love them for it.”

For better or for worse, pets almost never turn out the way you expect them to, particularly in a time when adopting one is supposed to fill the giant hole in your heart where your social life used to be. In March, my best friend, a lifelong cat whisperer, agreed to take in four day-old kittens. She woke up each night to bottle-feed them every two hours, and two still died — a sad but inevitable outcome of many litters.

My friend’s little sister just adopted the world’s most photogenic Australian shepherd puppy and now it won’t stop biting everything. Another friend fostered a puppy at the beginning of quarantine and was so sad when he went to his forever home that they adopted his sister. I suspect I’m not the only one dealing with a terrified new cat: When I asked if my pet store had any calming pheromone spray, the clerk laughed and said they were “very out.”

The important thing, though, is that we continue to love our quarantine pets after things start to feel somewhat normal again. Katy Hansen of the NYACC says that they’re prepared for an increase in surrenders over the next few months, but not for the usual reasons. “As people lose their jobs, there’s going to be financial hardships,” she says. Animal shelters, too, are facing the same concerns as any small business right now. The ASPCA says it is still unclear on the pandemic’s impact on animal welfare, but that “in addition to the unprecedented challenges this crisis creates for people, it also puts animals at risk by straining essential owner and shelter resources.”

During our phone call, I told Hansen about Hubert, but she wasn’t worried. “They’re what we call spirit cats,” she says. “They just need some time, and then before you know it they’ll be crawling all over you!”

Hubie isn’t there yet, and that’s okay! We’ll get to know each other together — the treats he likes, the sounds he hates, the corners in the apartment he prefers to vomit. All that matters is that he’s home, just like the rest of us will be for the foreseeable future. It’s a scary time for everyone right now. Even cats.

"['Risa Kerslake', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,"“IVF cost me $55,000 to fix my fertility, and it was worth it”","Paying thousands of dollars for a chance at pregnancy is a little like playing Russian roulette. Either you’re going to be relieved when you find yourself still breathing at the end or your whole life will seemingly be over.

This is how I found myself flat on my back, feet in stirrups, as the doctor squirted two microscopic embryos into my uterus. I had been here before — four other times, actually — but I swore to myself that this was going to be the last time. I owed people a lot of money and was sick of injecting myself with hormones on a daily basis.

“Do you see them?” The nurse pointed as a little blip moved slowly across the monitor.

My husband squeezed my hand, but I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. This was it. This was the last chance for us, and all I could do was pray one or both of these babies stuck around.

IVF was never the plan. Pregnancy scares while I was still in nursing school, sure. Maybe a few months of wondering why it hadn’t happened yet when I finally did want it, complete with some ovulation kits — that I could see as a worst-case scenario. But not IVF. Not Follistim and Gonal-F, which both sound vaguely kinky but really are just hellishly expensive fertility medications. Not years of waiting, crying, and screaming into my pillow.

I was 24 when my husband and I thought seriously about my going off birth control. We hadn’t even been married for a year; it’s been so long now that I can no longer remember why we decided to toss the pills and try for a baby much earlier than we’d ever discussed. Perhaps it’s just that I’d always wanted to be a mom, and the time seemed right for us to get pregnant.

I figured if we started right after graduation, I could be established in my first nursing job by the time the baby was born. I’ve always been a planner, and I thought pregnancy would be no different because I was young and healthy. I thought I could practically schedule my due date on the calendar.

I thought I could practically schedule my due date on the calendar

As much as I assumed it was just going to happen because it happened for everyone else around me, it didn’t go that way. After 18 stressful months of my husband and me trying, we realized we were officially in uncharted territory. Regular, old-fashioned baby-making wasn’t getting us anywhere, so I spoke with my doctor and she recommended timing sex according to my cycle and using ovulation predictor tests to up our chances.

News flash: Having sex dictated by a smiling face on a pee stick or on a doctor’s schedule gets to be a chore quickly. Soon after, I found myself swallowing fertility drugs like candy — small white pills meant to help me ovulate, spread out over two years. When that wasn’t working, we threw in a fertility clinic a year later and three cycles of IUI (intrauterine insemination) to increase the odds of conceiving. IUI was meant to take the best sperm and shoot them right up where they were supposed to go.

I didn’t get pregnant. Instead, I started feeling like I was on some nightmare merry-go-round of endless fertility treatments. I think on some level, I knew the tame procedures we had been doing weren’t working. It was time to bring in the big guns.

That meant IVF: a hardcore, intense month of blood draws, doctor appointments, and multiple shots in my stomach daily. I had read a lot of infertility blogs at this point. I prepared myself for the egg retrieval, the emotional turmoil that is waiting to see how many embryos were growing, the transfer where you were officially deemed PUPO — pregnant until proven otherwise.

I read all these things, but nothing can truly prepare you for it. I remember swallowing hard at the price tag, but I had read about that too. It was like you were part of an exclusive club where you paid more than you could afford; still, you did it, because you believed it would be meaningful in the end.

We did three sessions in a span of 13 months. Ambitious, but probably foolish. I mixed powdered medications into syringes like the expert pharmacist I was not. I became hip with the IVF lingo while spreading my legs for yet another internal ultrasound. Changing diapers was still foreign to me — waiting on my embryo fertilization report felt safe and familiar even through the stress.

After our fourth round of IVF, in which we used donor eggs for the first time, had failed, I sat with my laptop open, thumbing through my phone as I added up numbers from our invoices. Each of our three IUIs averaged $400. Even with the insurance program at our clinic, we were responsible for $12,000 for three rounds of IVF. There was no further coverage for fertility treatments using our egg donor; that fourth cycle had cost us $15,800.

I turned to my husband, who was watching a docuseries next to me. “We’ve spent over $28,000 on this.” I didn’t have to explain what “this” was. I said a swear word and then I said it again louder. It was the moment I started wondering what we were doing. What was the point to all this? I’d said it would all be worth it if we could have a baby. But what if we couldn’t? What if we just kept spending money on treatment after treatment, racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars, for nothing? I wanted to throw my laptop.

We had already taken out one loan during our IVFs, and had just taken out a second to pay for our donor egg cycles. Living paycheck to paycheck while racking up credit card debt wasn’t supposed to be in our plan. Our careers had allowed us to comfortably afford kids — but being thousands of dollars in debt before we even had them gave me a sick feeling that we were being irresponsible.

I couldn’t fathom a life without kids, but we were barreling toward it at an alarming pace

Our situation came to a head one evening at our favorite restaurant, when the waiter had just brought our food. In a matter of weeks, we were heading back to our clinic for a final cycle. If that didn’t work, we would be done, because the money was dwindling and there was only a certain amount of loans we could take out. Five rounds of IVF was enough for anyone.

I was not a fragile person. I didn’t back down from challenges easily, but that night I was tired. I was angry. At 28, I was certainly not old, but the fun of trying to have a baby had worn off a long time ago. I couldn’t fathom a life without kids, but we were barreling toward it at an alarming pace.

I could have continued shooting fertility medications all the livelong day. It was, after all, the only life I knew. If it weren’t for the money, I could have kept going. Knowing this was the last attempt, solely because of money, broke me. I cried as I sat across the table from my husband and told him I didn’t see much of a life afterward if this didn’t work. I know it was probably depression talking; I know I was hurting him with my words. We had married each other not to have gobs of children, but to spend our lives together, and yet here I was telling him he wasn’t good enough on his own.

So when I was lying in that hospital bed a few weeks later for my fifth embryo transfer (and another $13,000 poorer), I concentrated on happy thoughts as the doctor concentrated between my sheeted legs. I tried really hard not to think this was all for nothing once again. It was hard to feel positive and optimistic and all the other upbeat feelings I thought I should have as I watched our embryos slide gently through the tube into my uterus, their home for the next nine months. I hoped.

Even when I saw the single beating heart on the ultrasound a few weeks later, I wanted so desperately to believe this was it, but experience had cautioned me not to let down my guard. My career as a health professional had given me a lot of insight into the medical world, and I was well-versed in everything that could possibly go wrong. I knew how precarious early pregnancy could be. I was well aware of how often miscarriages occur, especially early on. Since more than one of my friends had lost a baby well into the second and third trimester, I couldn’t let down my guard, even then. For the first time, I cringed at my medical expertise.

In fact, it wasn’t until my baby took her first breath and wailed that I even let myself believe I would ever hold her in my arms. It didn’t seem real. We had been trying for a baby for nine years, and suddenly we found ourselves parents to a newborn.

What was more, for the first time, there were leftover embryos. The final cycle really wasn’t the end for us, as we had assumed. Not only did I now need to adjust my worldview that we were going to have a baby after infertility, but there was the potential for more.

It’s a little-known secret that when you’ve struggled to have kids, and you’ve succeeded in getting one, you may have the longing for another. You feel greedy that you already have everything you’ve ever wanted and still wish for just one more. Because that’s exactly what infertility robs you of: the choice. The ability to get pregnant on your timeline, and the choice to decide how big or small your family is going to be.

I remember the herculean effort that came along with those last embryos, physically, mentally, and financially. I was a mom to a 3-year-old. I did mom things like play dates and reheating my coffee three times a day. I had found comfort in my normalcy. I had a life like everyone else: a kid, sleepless nights, discussions over potty training and fevers. There was a lot of denial during that time, and a sense of feeling pulled in two directions. I had a child, but I also had three frozen potential children waiting, ones that could only come by more fertility treatments.

I was so sick of being that infertile person, but we knew we were seeing this thing through to the end. Still, it didn’t negate the fact that there was more than a little bitterness as I went back to the ultrasounds, the medications, and the dictating by medical professionals. It was another $14,000 we ended up spending on the two frozen embryo transfers it took to bring our last daughter into the world, almost exactly four years from where we left off.

That’s exactly what infertility robs you of: the choice. The ability to get pregnant on your timeline, and the choice to decide how big or small your family is going to be.

Infertility is messy, and it can leave permanent scars; I’m still in therapy and working through the aftereffects. Still, now my 4-year-old is running around shooting imaginary ice pretending to be Elsa, and my 6-month-old only lets me sleep in three-hour increments. Out of those three frozen embryos, one little girl came out and was the perfect caboose to our family.

I can’t say for certain when I’m going to stop “feeling infertile,” but it helps that there will be no more treatments. I still feel slightly sucker-punched when I see a pregnancy announcement on social media. My two girls are my world, but I feel exhausted when I think back on the past 10 years trying to bring them into it.

There’s a part of me that feels sick to my stomach about how much we spent. I don’t have any regret — it’s not about that. Some people just have to work a lot harder to grow their family, and that’s okay. We had the option to pursue multiple fertility treatments — something a lot of people don’t get to do for a variety of reasons, but primarily financial. When I’m sitting on the floor building a Lego tower with my daughter while trying to bounce a fussy baby, I think back to that morning in the hospital bed, watching the grainy blip of light on the screen, and how everything was riding on that moment. There was fear and uncertainty and hope. Through it all, there was always hope.

"['Vox First Person', 'Apr']",2020-04-13,I was sent to be treated for Covid-19 at the Javits Center. Here’s what it’s like.,"Share All sharing options for: I was sent to be treated for Covid-19 at the Javits Center. Here’s what it’s like.

Vox spoke with a patient who was recently treated at the Javits Center in New York City. The convention hall had just been converted into a field hospital run by the military for Covid-19 patients due to concerns about the city’s medical facilities becoming overwhelmed. While Cuomo has said the center had an expected capacity of about 2,500 people, much lower numbers of patients have been admitted thus far.

The patient wishes to remain anonymous, as he is discussing his medical history. This as-told-to is a composite of several interviews.

The last time I was at the Javits Center — the giant convention hall on Manhattan’s West Side — it must have been the International Auto Show, or the boat show, or perhaps to stop by one of those engineering conferences.

After all, if you live in New York long enough, you’ll end up finding yourself here sooner or later, for some reason or another. Of course, what I never expected was returning just past midnight, strapped to a stretcher in the middle of a pandemic.

I’d been sick for more than two weeks, and had known that I was positive for Covid-19 for several days, after getting the results of a test I took at my local, walk-in urgent care. At home, I’d spent most of my time lying in bed, with frustrating body aches, a fever, and an unrelenting loss of appetite. But even as some of those symptoms started to abate, my energy hadn’t recovered and I still felt sick. Getting up even briefly left me winded and weak, and I spent most of my days horizontal, waiting to feel better.

I’m a man in my 70s with high blood pressure. So after persistent prodding from my family, I returned to urgent care, where I found out I had concerningly low oxygen levels. I was sent to the emergency room and admitted. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, given supplemental oxygen, and started on Zithromax and hydroxychloroquine, the two drugs that are so prominently mentioned.

I’m not sure anyone is particularly enthused by the idea of being sent to a field hospital, let alone the Javits Center. And I was worried because I didn’t know who would be taking care of me, as opposed to my regular family doctor and the local hospital that I was familiar with. I didn’t know how I’d be able to communicate with my family and friends, and how and when I’d get out. I was also scared of being caught in the bureaucracy of the military, which I had no real familiarity with.

But after being settled in at the Javits Center, my apprehension eased quickly. My improvised, tent-like cubicle was comfortable, and my doctors and nurses were caring and watchful. And, in a strange way, seeing that other New Yorkers were being treated in a hospital erected seemingly overnight gave me hope that Covid patients were being well-taken care of.

I ended up at Javitz after the floor I was on at my local hospital was being restored to a regular, non-Covid surgical floor. So one evening last week, two transport personnel arrived, transferred me to a stretcher, and loaded me into an ambulance. They told me they had driven the ambulance all the way from San Antonio to New York, under a contract from FEMA.

Seeing that other New Yorkers were being treated in a hospital erected seemingly overnight gave me hope that Covid patients were being well-taken care of

After a bouncy, somewhat nauseating ride through the city, while I was still receiving oxygen, I was taken out at a loading dock in the Javits Center. A specialist took my vitals, but some medical paperwork was missing, so I was put back in the ambulance to return to my old hospital. Lying on the stretcher, worried, I was apprehensive I wouldn’t be taken back at my old hospital or admitted to Javits.

We did the whole operation again — riding through the city and being unloaded at Javits — and I was finally accepted at the field hospital at what must have been close to 1:30 in the morning. My “room” was separated by about 8-foot-tall gray partitions and long beige curtains. There was a chair, an oxygen concentrator, and an adjustable cot. I was not in the intensive care section, but an area that seemed to be for monitoring less-severe patients. I was surrounded by active duty and reserve military doctors, some of whom are volunteers. Many were from a contingent from Fort Hood, Texas.

In a way, my cubicle felt like a hospital room. But when you lie down on your back, you remember that you are — in fact — in a convention center, staring up to sky-high ceilings of steel. At night, the lights are dimmed, but they’re never turned off. It’s never completely silent, either. There’s always a quiet murmur of conversation. You have your privacy, but you never feel alone; you can always stick your head out and see medical staff walking around.

When you’re sick, you spend most of your mental energy occupied with your own symptoms. For me, Covid-19 has become a fixation with the blood oxygen levels reported on an oximeter, a small device that clips to your finger. The percentage fluctuates, and it can drive me crazy. When it goes down, I feel deflated. When it — occasionally — shows a very high number, I suspiciously mutter, “Don’t fuck with me.”

When you can, you notice what’s around you. The toilet facilities are a few steps away, they’ve set up trailers with restrooms — inside the building — like the ones you might see at a carnival or state fair. If needed, you’re accompanied to the bathroom by a medical person with oxygen.

When I left my cot, I saw New Yorkers from all walks of life. I saw people much more ill than I was.

You know that the staff is largely from the military from their handwritten name tags. But — mostly clad in protective gear — they looked the same, and as busy, as any medical staff dealing with Covid-19. Do I give credit to Andrew Cuomo, Bill de Blasio, or Donald Trump? I’d rather give the credit to the professional people running this place.

Of course, we are at war in a way. But my experience was in some ways like any other hospital. You need to advocate for yourself as much as you can. You need to remember your medications, your allergies, and your preexisting conditions. You gotta be prepared to speak up if you think there’s something that’s not quite right.

You know, I’d say it’s better not to get Covid in the first place, and I understand why someone would be anxious about coming here. But when I looked around, everything seemed to be in order. And I think they all did a fine job.

"['Sarah-Vaughan Brakman', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-09,Social distancing isn’t a personal choice. It’s an ethical duty.,"Social distancing is inconvenient at best, truly burdensome at worst. What hasn’t helped matters is the confusing messaging of why we should social distance at all. We’ve been conditioned to think social distancing is only about us — lowering the risk to one’s self and one’s family. And yet we’ve also been told that this is something we need to do to protect others.

While not necessarily incorrect, both ways of thinking about it are not equal to the task before us. What we need is an exhortation to act that is grounded firmly in an ethical foundation, one that not only gets at the deeper purpose of social distancing, but that also lays the groundwork for a more resilient society on the other side of this crisis. We as a global society need to see social distancing as nothing less than an act of solidarity, an intentional choice that binds us in a common cause.

Some US leaders have started making this rhetorical shift. In one of his daily press briefings on the coronavirus, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) leaned into the message: “We are united, and when you are united there is nothing you can’t do.”

This echoed what former Vice President Joe Biden said after the Democratic primaries when calling for social distancing; this is “a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact what happens, make a big difference in the severity of this outbreak.”

Biden added, “It’s in moments like these we realize we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans. ... We are all in this together.”

Both statements implicitly appeal to solidarity. Last week, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) appealed to solidarity outright, embracing the claim that social distancing is another name for social solidarity, “because by staying apart we are actually coming closer together in common cause to defeat Covid-19.”

Cuomo, Biden, and Murphy are onto something: framing the need for social distancing as solidarity in action is much more meaningful and motivational than wonky (if accurate) discussions of “community mitigation strategies” and “flattening the curve.” Appealing to solidarity gives us a better chance of convincing people to practice social distancing. It is also the right move philosophically.

But what exactly do we mean by solidarity? In one sense, when we say we are in solidarity with others, we are foregrounding a common purpose and describing an empathetic response based on the recognition of mutual needs and shared identity. We are one human family, whatever our national, racial, ethnic, economic, and political differences. Inherent in human nature is not only our interdependence as finite beings but our need to form associations for emotional and economic welfare.

Appealing to solidarity in this sense is not novel. Not too long ago, Barack Obama called on people in the US to commit to mutual flourishing. In his farewell speech as president, he said that “democracy does not require uniformity.” However, he added, “democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity — the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.”

Cuomo hit this note when he said: “Black and white and brown and Asian and short and tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. ... And at the end of the day, my friends, even if it is a long day … love wins. Always. And it will win again through this virus.”

In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, the term gains even greater urgency. Solidarity becomes nothing less than an ethical stance. It speaks to a reorientation of an individual’s will to commit to doing what will protect and promote the common good (not to be confused with the greater good, a term from utilitarian philosophy that can call for the sacrifice of fundamental needs of some for the good of all).

Solidarity as an ethical virtue doesn’t just depend on feelings, but on a deeper sense of commitment to a cause bigger than yourself. By grounding social distancing in an ethical posture, we don’t just increase the likelihood of buy-in to deal with the present crisis — we cultivate a virtue that ensures we’ll stay the course.

The virtue of solidarity also includes a commitment to social justice. The vulnerable and marginalized among us need particular care and attention to make sure that the common good is being met. So when we ask people to practice social distancing for the good of those who are most likely to get seriously ill, we are asking them to see their social responsibility in light of the many overlapping communities to which they belong (families, friends, neighbors, New Yorkers, Americans, humans, etc.), and to appreciate that the vulnerable have a particular ethical claim on all of us to promote their well-being.

Why solidarity is an enduring basis for social distancing

Recent articles have discussed the ethics of social distancing, but in terms of altruism. By definition, altruistic acts typically entail personal sacrifices that are considered “above and beyond duty,” with no ulterior motivation or benefit.

But rooting social distancing in altruism isn’t as robust a motivation as you might think as framing it as an ethical duty. Social distancing really can save lives and protect long-term health. In other words, we really shouldn’t think of it as an optional act that we perform out of the kindness of our hearts. The downsides of not social distancing can be so severe that we need to think of it as an ethical duty to our fellow human beings.

Then there’s the second type of appeal: to our self-interest. We’ve been told to stay in for ourselves and for our families. While it’s not untrue that staying in will obviously redound to our and our families’ benefit, such appeals fail to get at the interconnected nature of the problem we face.

If we decide to take the risk of not sticking with social distancing, it’s not just ourselves we’re putting at risk — it is also our neighbors, our grandparents, our friends who might get hurt. We are seeing this with the tragic rise in numbers of sick and dying within extended families and within local communities. The health care system has been overwhelmed and the economy is suffering precisely because we are all vulnerable to each other.

Solidarity then is a more apt foundation for social distancing than either altruism or narrow self-interest. And the fact is the impulse of pulling together is already there — we just need to articulate it more explicitly. The reality of our shared fight and plight has drawn those of us practicing social distancing together, closer with loved ones, neighbors, and in many instances strangers, even as we are physically apart. We are finding alternative ways to connect to build and maintain our emotional and economic bonds.

In addition to social distancing, collaborative efforts to aid those who are in social isolation and the economically vulnerable are growing across the country. When we return from social distancing, it is up to us to make this inchoate commitment to our fellow human beings and the common good the new normal.

Some skepticism is certainly in order. Individualism is encoded in Americans’ national DNA. But solidarity is just as central to American identity as individualism. “Live Free or Die” co-existed with “Join or Die.”

When I was young, my grandfather shared stories of his experiences after the US entered World War II. One of the memories he shared was living through a period of gas shortages. The rubber supply for the US military was critically low.

Despite great pressure from the business sector, FDR in 1942 instituted strict gas rationing, meaning less driving and therefore less wear and tear on tires. It amounted to a de facto ban on pleasure driving, a popular leisure activity. Many Americans who are now over the age of 80 remember having to give up all the joys associated with pleasure-driving as part of the war effort. Efforts to increase public support included posters with messages such as “When you ride ALONE, you ride with Hitler! Join a Car Sharing Club TODAY!” (similar to today’s more encouraging #togetherathome and #stayhomesaveslives).

It wasn’t until the war was over when people could take to the open roads again. We were all in it together, my grandfather said, speaking to the sense of shared sacrifice and purpose that defined the time.

We face a common threat in Covid-19. Few of us will remain untouched. We are all in this together. Solidarity demands we do our part by holding each other accountable, as we hold each other dear (but not too near).

"['Kastalia Medrano', 'Apr']",2020-04-07,How to find a therapist during the Covid-19 pandemic,"The coronavirus pandemic has created a paradox in mental health care: Widespread social distancing means that more people are in need of support for anxiety and depression, and that more of those resources are harder to access in person. The past several weeks, though, have wrought a change in the national mental health care landscape — a big shift of services and social safety nets from face-to-face meetings to virtual ones.

Around the country, telehealth therapy platforms have exploded into sudden prominence. Support groups, too, have set up shop online. Mental health care services might be inaccessible through traditional means, but never before have they been so accessible through phones and computers.

“We realized by the second week of March it wasn’t going to be possible to offer many of our face-to-face meetings anymore,” said Bill Greer, president of recovery community SMART Recovery. “We’re scaling up very, very quickly [online] in response to the pandemic.”

If you’re one of the 59 million Americans covered by Medicare, new Covid-19 legislation has waived the long-standing restrictions on your use of telehealth services (for the duration of this public health emergency, that is). Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, restrictions on the use of phones to conduct telehealth visits have been lifted, meaning you can have your appointments over apps like FaceTime and Skype. And crucially, you can now meet with providers like this regardless of the distance between your physical locations, which used to just be an option for patients in rural areas that were basically therapy deserts.

To those who are very understandably feeling an increased mental or emotional strain brought on by the changes and the uncertainty of this pandemic, it’s valid to want to talk to someone about it. Very few of us want to process this alone. And whether you’re looking to move your therapy sessions online or just trying to figure out how to start therapy at all, you may find a lower barrier to entry than you’d likely face in non-pandemic times.

Here’s how to find a therapist or migrate from traditional therapy sessions to virtual ones.

If you’re new to therapy, don’t be intimidated. It just got more accessible.

A lot of people who might not have previously felt a need for mental health services are now finding themselves unsure of how to deal with the increased anxiety, uncertainty, and isolation this pandemic has brought. And while the thought of the bureaucratic nightmare that so often defines the search for a new health care provider — especially a mental health care provider — can often be intimidating to take on, this present moment is actually a good one for finding low-threshold access to care. You won’t have to trek from office to office, or face steep copays, or be limited to clinicians licensed to practice in your state. Therapy is more available than ever, and at a better price, too.

First, let’s figure out how you’re going to pay for it. If you don’t have insurance (or even if you do), there are resources available to you at no cost. Consider looking into Federally Qualified Health Centers, community-based centers that offer care including mental health and substance use services. They’re authorized to provide telehealth services even if you’ve never been a patient at one before; they have to prioritize patients who live inside their service areas, so search for one in your neighborhood here. An HRSA spokesperson told Vox that they’re encouraging health centers to provide telehealth counseling and that they’ve heard from many that are working to do so.

The national crisis text line allows you to connect with a crisis counselor for free simply by texting CRISIS to 741741 (you can also go through Facebook Messenger). It’s staffed by volunteer social workers and clinicians who reply within minutes and are available 24/7. They told me that their volume of incoming texts has roughly doubled in the past three weeks, with more than three out of four texters saying they’re experiencing anxiety related to the pandemic, and stressed that their volunteers will do what they can to help you. “If it’s a crisis to you, it’s a crisis to us,” said Ashley Womble, the organization’s head of communications. “Our conversations usually last around 30 to 45 minutes — it’s longer than you’d think.”

If you have private health insurance, a number of providers like Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield are currently waiving copays for telehealth visits, including those not related to Covid-19 symptoms. States like California and Arizona have ordered all insurers to cover telehealth services, too, and changes in other states could be coming.

Once you’ve figured out payment, it’s time to start looking for a therapist. This can feel daunting, but you have plenty of tools at your fingertips. If you have health insurance, your insurer’s website is likely the best resource to find covered telemedicine providers. If that is not an option, the most reputable and widely used websites that connect you with mental health professionals include Teladoc, Amwell, MDLive, and Doctor on Demand. Therapy Brands offers a directory that’s searchable by both region and specialty, and Psychology Today has a therapist directory that can be handy when you’re looking at price comparisons.

You can also find a therapist through “fast therapy” apps like TalkSpace, which connects you to a licensed therapist through not just video chat, but texting, too. Out-of-pocket TalkSpace subscriptions start at $260 per month — which sounds like a lot up front, but it gets you unlimited text, video, and audio access to a therapist five days a week. For comparison, IRL therapy might cost $200 per month in insurance copays for one 45-minute session once a week.

Once you’ve scheduled your first appointment, keep in mind that if you try a few sessions and don’t feel comfortable, it doesn’t mean therapy isn’t for you — it might just mean that therapist isn’t for you. It’s normal to meet with a few different people before you find someone you gel with, which you can now do in your pajamas rather than having to slog to a bunch of different offices across town.

Use video chat or phone for your appointments, and warn the people you live with that you need privacy

Even therapists who haven’t previously used telehealth services are pivoting to them now. Rather than Skype or FaceTime, many are using platforms like Zoom, Doxy, or thera-LINK, which have the advantage of being HIPAA-compliant, meaning your personal data is secure. In the week of March 25, thera-LINK’s parent company Therapy Brands saw a more than 4,000 percent spike in telehealth use compared to the week before.

“There have obviously been lots of [recent] changes,” said therapist and thera-LINK co-founder Carol Park. “I’ve done telehealth for years, but I moved my practice 100 percent online starting March 16. It’s been really seamless.”

If you’re encouraging your therapist to take their practice online, you might suggest thera-LINK’s Clients Plus for those who have been working at small offices, those at slightly bigger practices could try TheraNest, and those working through large firms can look to ShareNote. Therapy Brands also offers instructional videos, webinars, and customer service chats to help patients and providers navigate the logistics of moving their mental health care online.

When it’s time for your digital appointment, see if you can find a private space to conduct it. If you don’t live alone, consider shoring up your therapy appointments with a few boundaries — asking people not to disturb you during that hour, and maybe that they play something in their headphones or go on a (social distancing) walk outside to give you the peace of mind of privacy. You’re treating these video sessions as respectfully as you would traditional sessions; your family or roommates should, too.

Those in recovery from addiction can still find support and community online

This can be an incredibly isolating time for people dealing with substance use, but it’s possible to keep your support network digitally. Alcoholics Anonymous resources are accessible through a ton of sites like Online Intergroup, where you can find a directory of meetings taking place over Zoom as well as regular call-in numbers. Some, like Online Group AA, offer meetings via discussion boards. Others are primarily Skype-based. There are also a variety of AA-themed apps for download, many of them free.

Virtual Narcotics Anonymous offers meetings over the phone as well as online, and you can also search for meetings through Narcotics Anonymous here. Other digital options include Unity Recovery, Sober Grid, and In The Rooms, a free online recovery tool that serves 635,000 members and offers more than 100 different meetings a week, including AA and NA. In The Rooms’ livestream meetings usually top out around 100 people, but in recent weeks have swelled to as many as 550. “Everything started closing down and people were anxious, they said, ‘where do we go?’” said co-founder Ron Tannebaum. “It’s worked flawlessly so far. We’re so excited — we can even scale to larger meetings, maybe to 1,500.”

Encouragingly, the Drug Enforcement Administration has granted telehealth exemptions for doctors prescribing medication-assisted treatment to people with opioid use disorder, an area that’s normally subject to extraordinary regulatory oversight. And, as of March 31, people can get their buprenorphine, or opioid replacement, prescriptions refilled via telehealth platforms, too.

Support groups and fellowship programs like AA and NA aren’t regulated the way doctor-patient meetings are, and apps like Skype are subject to privacy concerns in a way that HIPAA-compliant platforms like thera-LINK are not. But online meetings do offer something crucial that one-to-one therapy or counseling does not: community.

“That familiarity is so important,” said Greer of SMART Recovery, which also offers online versions of local meetings, so you can attend a virtual meeting with the same folks you’d see in real life. “We’re trying to preserve as much of that as possible.”

This is a harrowing time for all of us. A recent study in The Lancet found that the psychological effects of social distancing can range from anger to fear to post-traumatic stress. But it also noted that there are benefits to focusing on the inherent altruism of sticking with quarantine guidelines, of limiting your contact with others and staying put. You can find some clarity and purpose in knowing that you’re helping protect people by moving your health care online. When you do, you’ll find a whole ecosystem of communities waiting to welcome you. Social distancing doesn’t have to mean we have to do everything alone.

"['Felisa Rosa Rogers', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-06,"Grocery, yeast, and toilet paper scarcity exposes rich to food insecurity of the poor","My friend Rhonda is eating a salad of iceberg lettuce and sardines. My cousin is on her last fresh tomato. My neighbor Nick has found a bread recipe that substitutes beer for baking yeast.

Watching relatively affluent people trying to cope with food shortages caused by the coronavirus crisis is interesting for those of us who have lived like this for years. So now you have some faint inkling of what it feels like, we think as we stare speculatively at the last onion.

According to a 2018 survey by the United States Department of Agriculture, 11.1 percent of American households could be described as “food insecure.” Until a few years ago, I was in that bottom 11 percent. My husband and I qualified as “low food security,” meaning that we were getting enough to eat but “the quality, variety, and desirability” of our diet was significantly reduced.

Poverty breeds creativity. I repurposed stale hot dog buns. I picked nettles and dandelion greens. I figured out how to cook without oil. I learned to love the foods that keep well and can be used in small quantities to brighten an otherwise grim meal: bacon, purple cabbage, red onion. And I learned to hate lentils because they are versatile, cheap, and quick, which meant that we ate bathtubs’ worth.

Food insecurity is vastly different from starvation, a condition that neither I nor many of my fellow Americans can speak to. This is because you are poor but not destitute. Food insecurity is not a dire emergency but rather a constant gnawing anxiety. You think about food all the time. Not in a hungry way, but in a calculating way. Which is much different from the disappointment my friends are experiencing when their Fresh Direct order is missing a few items.

I came to expect cold sweats when approaching the checkout line, that last panicked bout of mental math as you set the groceries on the conveyor belt. The bread is 2.99, the stewed tomatoes are 99 cents … if it’s too much, what will I send back? Telling the cashier I changed my mind about the sour cream and the sandwich meat and the orange juice always gave me a withering and inexplicable sense of shame.

The stigma of poverty is insidious and easy to internalize. If you’re experiencing anxiety about food shortages due to the Covid-19 crisis, take a moment to appreciate that no one is claiming that it’s your own damned fault and that maybe you shouldn’t have spent that money on a smartphone.

Obviously, this time of international food insecurity is more difficult for people who already suffer from income-based food insecurity. If you can’t afford to stock up, you have the reasonable fear that there will be nothing left by the time you can. In the absence of school lunch and breakfast programs, you’re suddenly faced with providing your kids three meals a day instead of one.

Meanwhile, food banks are struggling with dwindling volunteer teams, a sharp decrease in corporate contributions, a decline in food donations from grocery stores depleted by panic-buying, and a dramatic increase in the number of people lining up for boxes. So you can expect longer lines and a decrease in the quality and diversity of available food.

On the other hand, the chronically food insecure have developed useful skill sets. Among my lower-income friends and neighbors, there’s a certain confidence in our ability to survive, to weather economic and social hardship. There’s a sense of “We got this.” One friend told me, “I’ve been training my whole life for something like this.”

If you’ve been laid off due to Covid-19, you don’t necessarily have this advantage. It sounds strange to call chronic poverty an “advantage,” but in this case it might be. I was raised poor, and when my husband and I both got laid off in the economic crash of 2008, I already had the life skills I needed to live by the skin of my teeth. I knew what to expect and I knew how to go without. I feel for the people who are experiencing deprivation for the first time while simultaneously trying to cope with the other extreme stress factors we’re all facing.

As for me, I’m lucky now. I’m looking at a pantry full of cans, a freezer full of meat and vegetables, and a crisper with a few remaining carrots and greens. We’ll run out of onions tonight. But this is nothing. This feels positively luxurious compared to the time I inadvertently lost 30 pounds because I was trying to live on the cheapest diet I could figure: scrambled eggs, broccoli, and fortified cereal.

Meanwhile, my upper-middle-class friends are “anxiety baking” and complaining about having to wash so many dishes. I’m part of a Facebook group where people are documenting their quarantine cooking. There’s a sense of solidarity and camaraderie in deprivation and in substitution. But this shared experience is very different from the quiet struggle of people who are used to going without.

Income-based food insecurity doesn’t usually appear on social media. People aren’t humble-bragging on Instagram about having to feed the kids mayonnaise and ketchup sandwiches. Poor Americans suffer their food-based anxieties in silent shame.

This isn’t intended to belittle middle-class Americans for feeling anxious about running out of baking yeast, nor is it intended to shame anyone who is, on some level, enjoying the adventure of doing without. These are anxious times and we all need to make our fun where we can.

But if you’re new to this game, remember that your creative “quarantine cooking” or “eating out of the pantry” may actually look ridiculously sumptuous to people who suffer from chronic food insecurity. For one in 10 families, constant food-based problem-solving is just everyday life, and there’s no real hope that this gnawing anxiety will go away when the pandemic abates.

"['Alice Wong', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-04,I’m disabled and need a ventilator to live. Am I expendable during this pandemic?,"It is a strange time to be alive as an Asian American disabled person who uses a ventilator. The coronavirus pandemic in the United States has disrupted and destabilized individual lives and institutions. For many disabled, sick, and immunocompromised people like myself, we have always lived with uncertainty and are skilled in adapting to hostile circumstances in a world that was never designed for us in the first place. Want to avoid touching door handles by hitting the automatic door opener with your elbow? You can thank the Americans with Disabilities Act and the disabled people who made it happen.

Technology, accessibility, and a hardcore will to live shaped me into a cyborg oracle ready to spill some hot truths. I am tethered to and embedded with a number of things that keep me alive: a power wheelchair, a non-invasive ventilator that is connected to my chair’s battery, a mask that goes over my nose attached to a tube, metal rods fused to my spine. How I sound, move, and look elicits pity and discomfort by many in public. This is the norm.

My family and I have been sheltering in place for over three weeks in San Francisco. As news warnings of overcrowding in hospitals and scarce resources push hospitals to consider rationing care, I’m deeply concerned. Already, disability rights groups have filed complaints that some states, such as Alabama and Washington, are making triage recommendations that discriminate against people with disabilities. While the federal health department’s Office of Civil Rights released a bulletin on non-discrimination during the pandemic, I’m still worried. The ethical frameworks for rationing often put people like me at the bottom of the list.

Bioethicists and philosophers like Peter Singer, a utilitarian philosopher infamous in the disability community as someone who advocates for our erasure, have applied cool, rational, elegant arguments and thought exercises on who should live and die during crises like this. But where are the disabled doctors, bioethicists, and philosophers in this global conversation? They actually exist and need to be heard and involved, like Dr. Joseph A. Stramondo from San Diego State University, who wrote a blog post for The American Journal of Bioethics about triage and the coronavirus:

...there is a significant body of empirical evidence showing that there is a substantial gap between a disabled person’s self-assessment and how their quality of life is judged by folks that have never experienced their disability. Some prominent bioethicists even refer to this as the “disability paradox.” To me, there is little paradoxical about disabled people valuing their own life more than it is valued by non-disabled people making judgments based on stereotype and stigma. To conceptualize it as paradoxical is to wrongly assume that disability inevitably diminishes well-being.

Eugenics isn’t a relic from World War II; it’s alive today, embedded in our culture, policies, and practices. It is imperative that experts and decision-makers include and collaborate with communities disproportionately impacted by systemic medical racism, ageism, and ableism, among other biases.

The debates on health care rationing unveil how our society devalues vulnerable populations. Draft guidelines from various states and health systems identified people with dementia, cancer, intellectual disabilities, and many other pre-existing conditions as those who will not benefit from treatment compared to younger, healthier, non-disabled people. Dr. James Keany, an ER physician at Providence Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, California, was quoted recently in the Los Angeles Times: “As it stands in the US, if your family member is adamant that you would want everything done and you’re 90 years old, wearing a diaper, severely demented, you would get put on a ventilator ... Most countries consider that malpractice because what are you saving that person for?”

Everything is personal and political for me. I know people with cognitive and developmental disabilities. I use disposable briefs when needed and require total assistance with my personal care such as eating, dressing, and bathing. Were I to contract coronavirus, I imagine a doctor might read my chart, look at me, and think I’m a waste of their efforts and precious resources that never should have been in shortage to begin with. He might even take my ventilator for other patients who have a better shot at survival than me. All of these hard choices doctors have to make primarily hurt those hit hardest, not the people who present as worthy investments of scarce resources. Who gets to make these hard choices and who bears the brunt of them is a matter of inequality and discrimination toward protected classes.

Even the notion of “quality of life” as a measurable standard is based on assumptions that a “good” healthy life is one without disability, pain, and suffering. I live with all three intimately and I feel more vital than ever at this point in time, because of my experiences and relationships. Vulnerable “high-risk” people are some of the strongest, most interdependent, and most resilient people around. We may still face significant disparities in political power, which results in being left out of policymaking, but we know how to show up for each other. Disabled communities, queer communities, and communities of color have been hustling and providing mutual aid since time began. Many of us know the safety net has gaping holes and the state will not save us, so we’re going to save ourselves with abundance, wisdom, joy, and love.

Disabled people are not acceptable collateral damage in this pandemic. I want to believe that the future is not just mine, but ours. When one of us falls through the cracks, we all suffer and lose something. Time and ventilators are scarce, but we have the creativity, moral courage, and collective power to shape a world that has space for all of us.

"['Arghavan Salles Jessica Gold', 'Arghavan Salles', 'Jessica Gold', 'Apr']",2020-04-02,Health care workers aren’t just “heroes.” We’re also scared and exposed.,"“I wish I wasn’t a doctor. I wish I wasn’t terrified at what I may be asked to do. I wish I could self isolate,” Dr. Rebecca Lawrence, a consultant psychiatrist in addiction in Edinburgh, Scotland, wrote on Twitter last weekend.

As physicians ourselves, we find Lawrence’s sentiments understandable, her worries heartbreaking. All of it is tangible and real in the face of a pandemic that has already cost the lives of many health care workers, and poised to take even more.

But what is perhaps the most telling about her tweet is that she prefaced her comments by saying, “I’m going to say something unpopular,” and then ended it with an apology. It’s as though she felt like she should not, as a physician, express fear about this pandemic. She had to be a good doctor, stepping up to take care of others, without doubting her role and questioning the risk. It is as if she believed that physicians cannot be both heroes and human.

I’m going to say something unpopular



I wish I wasn’t a doctor

I wish I wasn’t terrified at what I may be asked to do

I wish I could self isolate



Sorry — Rebecca Lawrence T (@Rebecca99LT) March 28, 2020

This is a struggle we deal with daily. Just like everyone else, we have difficulties processing the new post-pandemic reality. We want to stand up for our colleagues to make sure those on the frontlines have the equipment they need to protect themselves, but doctors’ voices are being silenced all over the country. Hospital workers in New York are being told not to talk to the media, and some are being fired for questioning the safety of the personal protective equipment they are provided. This relays the message that our fears and concerns don’t really matter.

Meanwhile, we have anger, sadness, fear, and anxiety, immense feelings that seem to come out of nowhere, like a tidal wave, and scare us. We choke them down to just do our jobs. Because that is what doctors are supposed to do.

Most physicians are trained to put patients first. That ethos is drilled into us from the time we start medical school. Indeed, we have forsaken ourselves so frequently and for so long that the medical workforce suffers from burnout at higher rates than many other professions. And, while 80 percent of physicians say practicing self-care is “very important” to them, barely more than half of them practice it often. In other words, we do not practice what we preach.

This is especially the case with emotional expression. While patients have said they would be open to, or even appreciate seeing a physician cry, most physicians do not cry in front of patients and view it as inappropriate, unprofessional, or weak. For many, medical training is associated with a loss of empathy related to the immense distress and burnout trainees experience.

Physicians’ interest in the lives of our patients and connecting with them emotionally wanes over the course of our training as we are exposed to more trauma and role models that seem to pride themselves on their lack of emotion. Although there have been more conversations in recent years around how physicians cope with death and dying, expressing emotion is still not commonplace or expected.

Now add the stresses of a pandemic. Just imagine you are a physician right now. Your training taught you to put patients first and to show no emotions. You did that. But now you are under even more pressure than you ever thought you would experience. You are practicing medicine without adequate personal protective equipment to keep you from getting infected. You may be moving out of your home indefinitely in order to minimize risk of infecting your family. Your own health and the health of your colleagues are constantly at risk. And, you very likely will need to choose who gets a ventilator during rationed care and could even end up taking care of an intubated friend.

We have anger, sadness, fear, and anxiety, immense feelings that seem to come out of nowhere, like a tidal wave, and scare us

You might also be “redeployed,” a word that invokes military service with its very usage. In this context, however, being redeployed means being asked to practice a different type of medicine than the one you were trained to do. For example, a psychiatrist could be asked to cover internal medicine, or a surgeon could cover an intensive care unit. A physician might even be asked to go work in a different state. Like being a member of the military, being a doctor now means serving others regardless of your own needs.

This duty even supersedes graduations and retirements. In some states, medical students who have not yet graduated are being asked to start working as medical interns. Despite evidence suggesting older people are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, hundreds of retired physicians are also signing up to go back to work.

The willingness to serve others is a noble, beautiful thing about our workforce. But even for a profession that has historically always placed patient needs first, the degree of sacrifice being demanded of us now is unprecedented. Then, on top of all of these additional stressors, we still try to hold it in.

So what happens if you finally want to talk about — or, even, question — the demands placed on physicians? Early on in medical training, we learned that being a “good doctor” meant respecting the hierarchy, never expressing concern or doubt and always being a good “team player.” When things go seriously wrong in the care of patients, we analyze what happened. Just as is the case with every other failure we know about (for example, Chernobyl), when there have been adverse medical outcomes, there was often someone who could have spoken up but didn’t. This is a direct consequence of the strict hierarchy and culture of silence in medicine.

It’s no surprise, then, that Dr. Ming Lin was fired in Seattle after speaking up and asking for more personal protective equipment. Doctors are supposed to advocate for others but never for ourselves, lest we seem selfish or unappreciative. If it seems like we are exaggerating, keep in mind that doctors almost never take sick days because we don’t want to let down our patients or burden our colleagues. We also worry about parental leave for the same reason. If we don’t take adequate time for ourselves even when we have brought a new life into the world, can you imagine a doctor saying no to redeployment?

We can’t either. But that does not mean we should not talk about it and discuss and process the difficulties and emotions associated with all of these challenges. It does not mean we shouldn’t advocate for and support each other and even cry if we need to. Those of us who do cry or speak up, even publicly, are not worse doctors for it.

All over this country, doctors are putting on a brave face as they walk into hospitals knowing they might become infected. We know mental health outcomes in frontline providers are real and tangible, and happened at high prevalences in China, and we can only expect that to happen here. In private online groups and personal conversations, many are frightened and tearful, desperate to gain some control over their environment, trying to combat their inability to protect themselves and their loved ones.

So go ahead, clap and cheer for doctors — we need that right now. But also allow us space to be human. We need to cry, scream, and be able to tell the truth, too. We don’t want to end up crushing these medical professionals who are carrying too much weight as it is.

"['Nick Romeo', 'Mar']",2020-03-31,"The grim ethical dilemma of rationing medical care, explained","Evidence-based explanations of the coronavirus crisis, from how it started to how it might end to how to protect yourself and others.

With medical experts and politicians now predicting that coronavirus cases will dramatically exceed the capacities of hospitals across America, doctors and nurses face the prospect of picking which patients to prioritize for treatment. Though the term “triage” may conjure images of rough battlefield medicine and crude estimates of patients’ survival odds, excruciating decisions on whom to treat already confront doctors in some places and will likely soon be necessary in America.

In Italy, infections have skyrocketed so quickly that its fatalities have surpassed China’s, where the outbreak started, and doctors are already weighing whom to treat as sick patients overwhelm the hospital system. The published guidelines for an Italian intensive care unit noted that it may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care. Doctors are reportedly weeping in the hallways as they decide which patients to save. “If you have a 99-year-old male or a female patient, that’s a patient with a lot of diseases. And you have [a] young kid that need[s] to be intubated and you only have one ventilator, I mean, you’re not going to ... toss the coin,” a surgeon and oncologist in Rome named Carlo Vitelli told NPR last week.

The United States is likely not far behind, with the confirmed case count already above Italy’s, and the country may soon experience an equally severe scarcity crisis. In New York City, health care workers are reporting that their resources are or will soon be overwhelmed. “These decisions run counter to everything that we stand for and are incredibly painful,” tweeted Meredith Case, an internal medicine resident at Columbia/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, on March 25. “Our ICU is completely full with intubated Covid patients. … We are rapidly moving to expand capacity. We are nearly out of PPE. I anticipate we will begin rationing today.”

Guidelines for rationing scarce resources differ by state, though many assign rankings based on a patient’s odds of both short-term and long-term survival. The federal government has not yet released official recommendations for the Covid-19 pandemic.

But difficult moral questions about how to allocate scarce medical resources have received extensive consideration from both philosophers and doctors, and it’s been the subject of rigorous academic study among bioethicists. After Hurricane Katrina, professors at Stanford University developed a widely used framework to guide medical decision-making in situations of resource scarcity, such as pandemics and natural disasters. In an influential 2009 article in The Lancet, Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, and two co-authors gave a systemic analysis of moral principles of allocation and how doctors can use them. Some researchers have even developed mathematical models to help decide whom to treat first.

As the coronavirus sweeps across America, these ethical principles will collide with the messy realities of limited medical resources in dramatic ways. Despite the best efforts of philosophers and physicians, the results will inevitably be imperfect compromises that invite a thousand more questions on how to judge whose life is worth saving.

Deciding whom to treat comes down to an ethical dilemma

There are three theories of how to make ethical triage decisions, according to David Magnus, director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics: egalitarianism, utilitarianism, and prioritarianism.

Doctors and nurses aren’t philosophizing about these approaches as they make long rounds and rush to treat patients. Rather, these frameworks allow health care professionals to streamline decisions and focus on medical tasks, not be mired in moral questions or burdened by guilt after making hard decisions. “As much as possible, we want to move away from forcing clinicians to make bedside decisions and to have broader decision-making about these issues in advance,” said Magnus.

Each theory has its own moral logic. Egalitarianism seeks to treat patients equally; using a lottery system to select vaccine recipients is one example. Utilitarianism aims to maximize total benefit, generally measured by the remaining life years — or expected remaining high-quality years — that decisions will save. If a 20-year-old and an 80-year-old both required a ventilator, treating the 20-year-old would likely maximize life years. In a choice between two people of the same age, the quality of life that each could expect upon recovery would become relevant. Prioritarianism, or the “rule of rescue,” treats the sickest people first; emergency rooms operate on this principle, for example, choosing to treat the gunshot wound victim before the person with a broken leg.

“If you have a patient on a ventilator and they have to be taken off – that is probably the most horrible of all decisions for a doctor or nurse”

Though each of these appeals to certain moral intuitions, they all have serious problems. To treat patients equally, for example, is also to treat them indiscriminately — because egalitarianism does not distinguish between the age of patients or the severity of their conditions, it can easily seem like an arbitrary or wasteful use of resources.

Utilitarianism confronts the notorious difficulty of ranking quality of life and ignores the moral imperative of urgency. Imagine that the same medical resources could be used either to save one 75-year-old from coronavirus or perform a dozen hip replacements for 65-year-olds. While the latter might ultimately create more years of happy, healthy life, most would consider it the wrong choice, as the recent cancellations of elective surgeries around the country show.

Meanwhile, a rule to prioritize the sickest patients first can clash with the goal of helping the greatest number possible: Lavishing extensive resources on a single patient with only a small chance of surviving could mean refusing treatment to multiple patients who are less sick but more likely to live if treated.

While analyzing trade-offs among these principles is vexing in theory, making and implementing decisions in real time can be excruciatingly difficult. “If you have a patient on a ventilator and they have to be taken off — that is probably the most horrible of all decisions for a doctor or nurse,” said Emanuel. “Vaccines are not always life-and-death. But if someone who doesn’t have a ventilator is going to die, having to withdraw that person is incredibly psychologically traumatic, and this is likely to happen.”

And the nature of medicine makes some ambiguities inevitable. There’s space for individual judgment, for instance, about what constitutes an urgent versus elective surgery, or when respiratory failure is irreversible. If an older patient with coronavirus and a short life expectancy required CPR, it could be difficult to decide whether saving the patient justified exposing health care workers to significant risk.

In normal circumstances, many patients on ventilators in America have only a very small chance of survival, Magnus explained. Family members often insist on continued treatment even when loved ones will almost certainly not recover. “In our society, the ICU often becomes a place for grieving and prolonging the dying process. It’s not obvious that this is a good use of resources even in normal circumstances, but it’s just not going to be possible now,” he said.

What makes one life more worth saving than another?

The ethical dilemmas posed by the coronavirus are real-world examples of deep moral questions philosophers have studied for centuries. Princeton’s Peter Singer, probably the world’s most famous living utilitarian philosopher and a vocal proponent of effective altruism, told Vox, “There’s always a scarcity of resources in medicine, but situations like this make it particularly clear.”

Singer said he favors a utilitarian approach that considers multiple factors: the life expectancy of patients, some types of adjustment for quality of life, and perhaps the patient’s ability to help others. He gave the example of a patient with severe dementia or terminal cancer with a six-month life expectancy as cases where it might be reasonable to prioritize other patients. Attempts to rank quality of life are controversial, particularly in cases of disability, but they are also already widely used.

In the United Kingdom, quality-adjusted life year, or QALY, scores are a crucial factor in health care decision-making and are calculated by multiplying years of life by quality of life. If a given medical treatment would allow a patient one year with full quality of life, the patient would have a quality score of 1. If the same treatment would produce a year of life with only half of the normal quality of life, they would have a quality score of 0.5.

Numerical scores might give the illusion of objectivity, but the complexities of actual life inevitably complicate such decisions. Mental health, family size, income, temperament, pain tolerance, and professional, personal, and relationship satisfaction — a vast array of factors that escape quantification still influence the quality of one’s life but are not accounted for in current equations.

These are incredibly challenging and controversial decisions to make. In particular, people with disabilities have spoken up about their concerns that they will be left behind whenever triage decisions are made. “People with disabilities deserve to have equal access to scarce medical resources,” wrote the American Association of People With Disabilities in a letter to Congress, “and should not be subject to resource allocation discrimination when needs exceed supply...we believe that during this difficult period it is especially important to protect patients with disabilities from discrimination.”

The Office for Civil Rights at the US Department of Health and Human Services has also announced that it is investigating states rationing plans to ensure that they are compliant with civil rights law. As Alice Wong of the Disability Visibility Project told the New York Times, “I deserve the same treatments as any patient. As a disabled person, I’ve been clawing my way into existence ever since I was born. I will not apologize for my needs.”

“The only way to solve this is through massive social collaboration”

For a utilitarian, prioritizing those who can benefit others is a defensible choice. “The classic case might be the Army doctor whose treatment is prioritized because he will be able to treat others,” Singer said. “I suppose in the current situation maybe it’s possible to make a case that certain doctors would be in a similar position, but of course you would want to be careful that you were not just prioritizing the health of your colleagues.” In fact, prioritizing medical workers is one of the suggestions made by Emanuel in an article recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine making recommendations for triage in the Covid-19 pandemic.

But defining what constitutes a benefit to others is also difficult and controversial. Elizabeth Anderson, a MacArthur “genius” grant winner and philosophy professor at the University of Michigan, cautioned against thinking in too “ruthlessly consequentialist” a manner. “In strictly consequentialist terms, you might ask who are the most valuable workers, but actually, that’s not the right way to think about it,” she told Vox. “In reality, if the CEO of a major corporation had a heart attack, they are actually more replaceable than the parent of young children, who need specific individuals to be there for them and have a very personal relationship with their parents. It’s an argument for prioritizing caretakers,” she said.

One factor that doctors and philosophers agree should not be relevant is the wealth of patients. But it’s also an undeniable reality of American health care that wealth improves quality of care. “It’s a huge flaw in the American system compared to any other affluent society,” Singer said. Emanuel imagined a scenario in which a scarce supply of coronavirus vaccines became available on the open market. “You don’t want a vaccine that only the rich can buy,” he said, adding that some form of random selection like a lottery would be preferable. “There is no moral framework in which wealth plays a role.”

As the number of cases continues to spike, American health care workers will likely face agonizing decisions on how to ration care — and soon. That’s why for now, self-quarantining and social distancing are themselves moral decisions we can all make that can have significant impacts. “How bad the triage will be depends enormously on the behavior of ordinary people now,” Anderson said. “The only way to solve this is through massive social collaboration.”

Taking collective action to decrease the scale of infections will ultimately reduce the suffering not only of patients but of nurses and doctors. “Triage is awful — it’s traumatizing,” said Anderson. “Doctors who have dedicated their careers to helping people now have to turn people away. It’s dreadful. It’s really on all of us to pull together so that we don’t force these horrible triage choices.”

"['Michael Waters', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-28,5 people on what it feels like to have Covid-19,"Shortness of breath, chest pains, fatigue, aches, coughs, fever — these are all common symptoms that people who have tested positive for Covid-19 are reporting.

While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has listed fever, cough, and shortness of breath as the three major indicators of Covid-19, some front-line doctors, including the American Academy of Otolaryngology, suggest that a wider set of symptoms might signal a Covid-19 infection — and that the intensity of the illness can vary wildly depending on the case. Some patients report losing their sense of taste or smell, for instance, and while some report only mild coughs, others say they struggled to breathe. While not necessarily diagnostic for Covid-19, the CDC also designates other experiences — like trouble breathing, pain or pressure in the chest, or bluish lips — as emergency warning signs that require immediate medical attention.

To understand how people who have received positive Covid-19 diagnoses are experiencing the disease, especially in light of overcrowding hospitals and a testing system that remains inaccessible, I spoke to several Covid-19 patients from across the US. Some had mild symptoms, like coughs and chills; others had to cancel scheduled phone interviews with me because they were feeling too weak to talk. Several reported multiple instances in which they couldn’t breathe. But all had the same message: This disease is serious, and we need to stay home as much as possible to keep it from spreading to more people.

These interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.

“The desperation I felt when I couldn’t breathe was a horrendous feeling”

Luis Mancheno, 33, immigration attorney in Brooklyn

I stayed at home on a Friday morning two weeks ago because I had a lot of fatigue and body aches. Mid-morning, I started feeling chills and the body aches worsened. I took my temperature and I had a fever of about 101 degrees. For two days, I was unable to do anything. Finally the fever broke and the body aches almost ended.

Almost like clockwork, a dry cough started. Having read a lot about Covid-19, I messaged my doctor and let them know I had Covid-19 symptoms. My doctor said that there was not much I could do and that I just needed to stay home because testing was very limited and a positive test wouldn’t make a difference anyway.

By that Monday morning [March 16], I woke up not being able to breathe well. I couldn’t think or talk well because I was putting all of my energy toward breathing. There was also a really hard pressure on my chest that would not go away. That night, I went to the ER because my difficulty breathing worsened. The hospital staff immediately took me in and plugged me into an oxygen machine.

The ER doctor examined me and gave me the test for Covid-19. She also tested me for the regular flu and other viruses. They all came back negative. I was at the hospital for about four hours, after which the doctor told me I could go home. She let me know that they couldn’t keep me there because they needed the space for patients with more urgent cases. She warned me that I needed to come back to the ER, however, if I had difficulty breathing again.

On Wednesday night, right about before going to bed, I felt I could not breathe anymore. This time it was worse; I couldn’t really think clearly. I became extremely dizzy and I had difficulty walking. For the first time since my symptoms started, I became afraid for my life. My husband got me ready, packed me a bag up, and took me to the ER. It took us about 40 minutes, and luckily, by the time I got there, my breathing improved. I saw a doctor at the ER who confirmed that it was likely I had Covid-19 and who told me to go home because there was nothing else they could do for me.

On Saturday morning, as I started feeling a bit better finally, I received a call from the hospital to let me know I had tested positive for Covid-19.

It has been two weeks since my first symptoms appeared. I am finally feeling better. The breathing difficulty is almost gone, and my body is regaining strength. Covid-19 luckily only caused me temporary injuries, but it gave me a really big scare. The desperation I felt when I couldn’t breathe was a horrendous feeling I don’t wish for anybody.

“As a health care provider, I felt this weird moral failure of ‘what did I do wrong to get infected’”

Laura, 26, nurse in Philadelphia

I first noticed a headache that seemed to originate behind my eyes and through my temples [on March 16]. I had a dry cough and difficulty breathing that I only noticed when I exerted myself, like when I was running up the stairs, when I was playing with my dog, or when I tried to work out from home. I felt achy and had the chills. This only really happened in the morning the first day, and by the late afternoon I felt fine. When I woke up with the symptoms the next day, I decided to get tested.

Because I am a nurse and I was set to work in an outpatient clinic one week later, I needed to know if I should tell my boss to take me off the schedule. I ended up texting my friend who is an emergency medicine doctor. As a health care provider, I felt this weird moral failure of “how did this happen to me?” and “what did I do wrong to get infected?” My emergency medicine friend reassured me that it wasn’t my fault and that what is important now is that I take the proper precautions. She let me know of a drive-through Covid testing site at Penn Medicine that opened at 10 am that day. I quickly got in the car with my fiancé and he took me there.

I needed a referral from my primary care provider, but since I do not currently have one, I was able to get a referral from the doctor on site and make an appointment on my phone to get a place in line. The whole process took around 45 minutes.

I was told I would get a call in three to five days if I was positive and would get a text in up to 10 days if I was negative. My symptoms got progressively worse. I ended up losing my taste and smell with no noticeable congestion, along with additional gastrointestinal symptoms and overall fatigue. These symptoms would come in waves, and there were some afternoons where I would feel completely fine and others where I felt completely exhausted and immobilized. On day five, I got a call saying I tested positive.

I have been symptomatic for over a week now. Not much has changed. I am getting virtual check-ins twice a day to monitor my symptoms via Penn Medicine’s automatic texting program. I feel guilty not being able to help, as so many of my fellow nurses are on the front lines, struggling to take care of our loved ones amid a PPE [personal protective equipment] shortage, but I am happy I was able to get tested early to prevent the spread.

The most frustrating symptom has been not being able to smell or taste anything on top of having GI symptoms. It makes it really hard to eat. Other than that, I feel lucky for all the people who are doing all they can to keep people like me safe and healthy.

“They did X-rays and determined my lungs were filling up with fluid”

Mike, 57, IT worker in Seattle

I honestly thought I had the flu, a really bad flu. I was feeling very weak and achy. I felt short of breath. I had a fever that came and went. [On Monday, March 16,] I went to urgent care wearing a mask and hunkered in the corner of the waiting room. I continued to have a difficult time breathing. Tests for the flu were administered, and while they were awaiting the results, the doctor decided to do a chest X-ray due to the cough and breathing issues.

The flu tests came back negative, so they decided to administer the Covid-19 test. That test is not performed on site so it had to be sent into a lab. Also, the chest X-ray came back showing that I had pneumonia.

I received a positive result to the Covid-19 test Thursday afternoon [March 19]. That day was the worst day so far. I went to the ER, but of course the hospital was not equipped to handle patients that were positive for Covid-19. Basically, they were containing me until a bed could be found in another hospital. They did X-rays and determined my lungs were filling up with fluid. You feel like your lungs are going to explode. Fourteen hours of hell later, a bed was found.

At 2:30 am on Saturday, I was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital. I was given a big injection of antibiotics, which made me immediately vomit. I was also put on hydroxychloroquine and another antibiotic twice a day. I started feeling better later that day, but still had heavy coughing fits. By the end of the day, the fluid was going down in my lungs.

On Sunday the same week, I was able to get the doctor to let me go home to finish recovering because it didn’t look like I needed a ventilator and there were plenty of other patients that could use the room. My oxygen saturation was good.

Since then, the coughing fits have been horrible and extremely painful. I was sent home with a rescue inhaler and the meds to finish off. I have gone all day today [Thursday, March 26] without a heavy coughing fit. I have been careful in my movements — climbing stairs and standing up from a chair — to try and not aggravate my lungs.

I have heard that there are some out there that feel this is really just like the flu. But it’s not at all. I had the flu pretty bad once that put me down for 10 days. It’s nothing compared to this.

“Friends and family leave everything I need on my doorstep”

Tina, 52, stay-at-home mom in Buckeye, Arizona

I first noticed my symptoms a few days after going to Disneyland. I woke with a sore throat and a little cough. It felt like an annoying tickle. Day two, the fever set in, the cough got worse, the sore throat was worse, and it began to be uncomfortable to take a deep breath. By the time I got back home to Arizona at the end of day two, I thought for sure I had gotten a bad cold or maybe the flu.

It gradually got worse every day. I started feeling very weak, having bad headaches. My neck hurt. I was nauseous. I couldn’t take a deep breath. My chest hurt, my ribs were sore, it hurt to breathe. After a few days, I called the nurse line, explained my symptoms, and was told to go to the emergency room right away. She called ahead to tell them I was coming. When I got there, they guided me through an entirely different entrance. They all wore head masks and robes and wore double gloves. I didn’t see one other patient the entire time I was there.

I was put in a room and kept isolated. They ran tests and X-rays, and I was told I had the virus and had to be on home quarantine for at least 14 days with no contact with anyone. Since then, my cough has gotten worse; I haven’t been able to control my fever. My body feels weak and tired all the time and is just sore. I still have the sore throat, and it hurts to swallow. I haven’t left my house. Friends and family leave everything I need on my doorstep.

I haven’t gone back to the hospital just for the fact that they have no cure and they can’t do much more there except put me on a breathing machine, which I don’t need yet. I pray each day that it will get better and the breathing doesn’t get worse and the fever will finally stay down. It’s a very scary position to be in. There’s no one to ask questions to because nobody knows any answers. Just hoping tomorrow will be better.

“Just felt exhausted the whole week”

Chuck Armstrong, 38, tech worker and theater producer in Brooklyn

I woke up on Tuesday, [March 10,] feeling sick. It was very minor — usually once a year I get a cold or a very minor flu. It’s usually just a 36-hour thing. I had some aches and chills but nothing that I thought would hamper my day-to-day at all.

Then Thursday, I start to get worse. I have a noticeable fever, I’m very tired, so I locked myself down. That was when I watched Tombstone (Val Kilmer deserved the Oscar). The next day I feel worse. My fever gets up to 102 but I never had a bad cough. My fever always got worse at night and better in the morning, from 99 to a high of 102. I’d been taking Advil PM to kill the fever, and that didn’t help. I still had the fever for another couple of days.

When I woke up on Sunday the 15th, the fever was gone. The cough and the aches, chills, fatigue persisted for the next week. I talked to my doctor the following day, but his office had set up a teleconferencing situation. He said, “You should try to get tested.” I live in Brooklyn, so I went to my nearest urgent care on Tuesday, and the urgent care did not have any tests. I went to CityMD, a walk-in clinic, and they were hesitant to give me one because I’m in my 30s and don’t have prior health conditions. I told them how long it had been going, and they gave me the test. They said treat it like you have coronavirus, stay home, socially isolate as much as possible.

I no longer had a fever, but I did have the persistent cough and really bad fatigue. I was sleeping 10, 11 hours a night, no problem. No loss of appetite, no nausea or anything, just felt exhausted the whole week. I found out on Friday [the 20th] that the test came back positive.",vox,https://www.vox.com/first-person/2020/3/28/21197480/coronavirus-symptoms-covid-19
"['Louise Aronson', 'Mar']",2020-03-27,Coronavirus reveals just how little compassion we have for older people,"Pre-dawn on the first day of San Francisco’s shelter-in-place mandate, which went into effect March 16, the city sidewalks were empty. By midday, when crowds and chaos are the norm, the city remained eerily quiet. A few joggers took advantage of the open roadways, and I passed a half dozen other people who, like me, were walking dogs.

It is possible that more of us were out than should have been, given recent reports showing very low death rates in an Italian city that instituted a quarantine, and tragically high numbers of deaths in a nearby city that did not. It also seemed clear that most San Franciscans were being good citizens and staying home. That’s why one particular category of city stroller that day surprised me: people who were clearly in their 60s, 70s, and 80s, and probably even in their 90s — the highest risk group for Covid-19. Could they all have been on their way to “provide or receive essential services,” those scant activities allowed under the mandate? I suspected not. It seemed far more likely that they had ignored the pleas from public officials and the medical community that “vulnerable populations” must stay at home.

As a human being, I have a range of reactions to their defiance: concern, frustration, and compassion. As a doctor whose specialty is geriatrics, I try to weigh the many, complicated reasons an older person might be out with the significant reasons they — and all of us — should reconsider going outside. In these unprecedented times, individual liberties are at odds with the well-being of our species, and for most people, old and young, our present is pitted against our future.

Each of the first few days San Franciscans were supposed to stay at home, I passed older adults in uniforms or suits, apparently coming from or headed to work. Others went into our local pharmacy — maybe they live across the digital divide or can’t see well enough to order online. One couple’s location and tense facial expressions made me wonder whether they were going to a doctor’s appointment, worried a new cancer might not get the attention it would have a few weeks earlier — something we doctors worry about, too. Many were also carrying groceries or looked to be out for a walk on a sunny spring day, activities essential for human health and well-being.

As I passed a Starbucks, something caught my attention. Inside were three servers and six customers. All appeared to be in their 20s or early 30s, and I was convinced that I just stumbled upon a certain sort of conversation between them that is also prominent online: “If we get coronavirus, so what? We might not even notice. It’s those old people who will die.”

Then it hit me: those old people. They meant me.

Maybe I am crazy to be out given my age, the dog’s basic needs notwithstanding. I am in my 50s, and one Covid-19 death in my state was a man just one year my junior, albeit far less healthy. My risk, though lower than his, is real. Besides, we know with absolute certainty that both during the 1918 flu pandemic and in recent weeks, places where seemingly draconian social distancing measures were imposed had far less disease and death than those where it was not. Being out makes me a potential vector, an organism able to transmit disease, and puts me at risk of becoming ill myself. With a virus that seems to make people contagious before they are symptomatic, each of us might be the next Typhoid Mary.

On social media, people are taking note of the large numbers of older people across the United States leaving their homes against medical and government advice. Statements along the lines of, My young friends and I are practicing social distancing while old people are partying and signing up for cruises, capture their understandable frustration, but also reflect a lack of insight.

Two reasons why older people may be outside aren’t getting much consideration. The first, which I’ve witnessed often in my quarter-century of experience as a doctor for this demographic, is that they don’t consider themselves old. Although many societies define old age as beginning between 60 and 70, for many people, especially younger and healthier ones, the word “old” carries connotations of frailty, debility, and proximity to death. When those descriptors don’t apply, or when older people perceive them as not applicable, they don’t consider themselves old. As a young geriatrician, I sometimes found this mystifying. As I entered middle-age, I began to understand what patients had told me for years: that their sense of self hadn’t changed, even as the person in the mirror did.

A second unexamined reason elders may be outside is to assert their individual rights. One colleague asks why sentient older adults aren’t allowed to assess and assume their own risk, like younger and middle-aged adults who are permitted to exercise and shop so long as we practice social distancing. I see her point, but human history shows with tragic eloquence that we cannot always trust people — whatever their age or background — to choose the greater good over their own self-interest. In the United States, I imagine another factor may be influencing some elders’ responses to stay-at-home directives: Although the overwhelming majority of older people are cognitively healthy, they are so often portrayed as universally mentally and physically feeble, and we have so little sympathy for people who are differently or not able-bodied, that many are driven to deny their chronological identity in self-defense. Americans have created a culture so ageist that some people may prioritize not being perceived as “old” over their considerable physiologically and immunologically established risk of getting sick and dying from coronavirus.

From her assisted living facility, my 86-year-old mother reported that her friends who still live in their family homes were going out for walks. My parents moved into the facility years ago for my father’s sake, and my mother stayed after his death because, she noted, “I’m not getting any younger.” Now, she was asking whether I thought she, too, could go out — the sky was clear and bright, flowers were in bloom everywhere. I told her I wasn’t sure. With sun and fresh air, a chance to move her body and see other humans, she would feel better. Those simple pleasures will also keep her healthier in the coming weeks and years, because loneliness and immobility are more quickly damaging to elders, and because my mother’s average life expectancy is five years, a statistic that also means she has a 50-50 chance of living longer than that.

But Covid-19 is also more dangerous for older people. And more importantly, there is this: If we all think only of ourselves, the pandemic will spread, and tens or hundreds of thousands of lives may be lost unnecessarily.

My mother did not go out.

Later that day, her facility imposed a lockdown, and I stopped by to pick up her taxes since, unable to go for walks, to her gym, to her classes, or out with friends, she had finished them. But she could not mail them herself. From the facility’s main doorway, she threw the envelope out onto a planter ledge. Feeling guilty, I talked with her only briefly. Like so many adult children of elders, I wondered if I should invite her to move in with us. We are luckier than many because she doesn’t have care needs, simple or advanced. But two of us were sick, and my health system listed several of our symptoms under ‘do not come to work’ stipulations. And since testing is not widely available, we would never know whether we had common colds or coronavirus, so the soonest my mother could come live with us would be two weeks after our symptoms disappeared. And that was a straightforward recommendation. Less clear was what to do about the young nephew who lives with us. Since being asymptomatic is common in his age group, we will never know for sure when it might be safe for my mother to be near him.

My last view of my mother as the door shut was heartbreaking. The door is divided into multiple small window panes. Normally this is pretty; on that day, it resembled the bars of a jail cell. Behind it, my mother looked tiny and sad and brave.

From his social-distancing run a few days into our collective sequestration, our nephew reported that Golden Gate Park was full of people, of all ages, congregating against all governmental, public health, and medical advice. The people in our city’s largest park were behaving as if on vacation, or as if this were an ordinary weekend in ordinary times. It takes some effort to formulate a compassionate response. Don’t they love their parents and grandparents? Don’t they value themselves? Human beings are social animals, but in this case, that instinct appears to be to the detriment of our families, neighbors, and species. After all, it seems likely that most of these same people also have access to smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the know-how to use apps and multiple digital communication platforms to remain social while sheltered.

The same cannot be said for the 1.3 million Americans, or 5 percent of people over age 65, who live in nursing homes, or some of the 1 million Americans in assisted living. They are on lockdown, shut into small rooms or apartments, the able-bodied with few or no direct human interactions, and the disabled restricted to care-related interactions with aides. That many risk hospitalization and death from Covid-19 does not negate several other truths of equal import: that some would choose death over lockdown; that even those who continue to drive, vote, and read have not been given a choice in whether or not to shelter in place; that almost all will suffer adverse health and longevity consequences if such physical and social restrictions are long-lasting, as it seems it will be; and that some will sacrifice their lives, in quality, quantity, or both.

One afternoon, my dog walk took me through a neighborhood of buildings devoted to elders, from senior housing to continuing care communities to nursing homes. All have restricted traffic to a single entrance. I passed three low-income senior apartment buildings and four high-end assisted living high-rises and saw no one. Normally, people and cars come and go, elders can be seen living their lives, a few off to work, many more headed out to exercise, shop, learn, volunteer or play, and some reading on benches in the fresh air. On that day, a huge cardboard box outside the main door to one well-groomed building asked that US mail be deposited there; only staff were allowed to enter.

Already, my geriatrician colleagues and I have begun to hear sad stories: the mother with Alzheimer’s who can’t remember why her family isn’t visiting, though she retains and loudly laments the injury of their absence. The old man without relatives nearby eating as little as he can manage so his food will last. Meanwhile, every day on my dog walks, I pass very old women pushing walkers from which hang bags of groceries. They look terrified when I approach and won’t allow me to offer help. While they live in mortal fear, I get a push notification from our local newspaper that officials are considering closing city parks because of the numbers of people choosing a few hours of fun over the health of their families, friends, and fellow humans.

A few media reports describe unimaginable evil: A Pennsylvania man who deliberately coughed at, then laughed at an old man at a grocery store during ‘seniors only’ hours, when the younger man shouldn’t even have been present. The residents of Italian care homes found abandoned and dead.

But there is also this: communities mobilizing tech and goodwill to help elders. Local and national organizations scrambling to screen, train, and send unprecedented numbers of volunteers to make phone calls, deliver meals, groceries and cards, or develop new online activities for elders and others at high risk for hunger, isolation, and loneliness.

As always, the fortunate remain more advantaged. From her assisted living facility, my mother reports that the chef made the perennial favorite lollipop lamb chops for dinner; the facility’s director went shopping in the early hours, then hand-delivered residents’ requested groceries and pharmacy supplies, and the staff has planned an in-room version of the usual ice cream social for Sunday afternoon.

It has always been true that how we treat our elders determines both the lives of current older people and the futures of the not-yet-old. The pandemic has added new dimensions to that equation, offering daily tests of our individual and societal moral identities, and an opportunity to create a better elderhood today and in the years to come.

"['Cheryl Wischhover', 'Mar']",2020-03-25,Working from home with kids feels unsustainable. Here’s how to ease the burden.,"“Today I took 1/2 Xanax to lift the brick on my chest — does that tell you something?” wrote a mother in a parenting Facebook group on a thread about how working parents are coping with the increased demands of trying to entertain and educate their children while also holding down jobs.

For almost two weeks now, families across the country have been forced into this situation as offices and schools have shut down and increasingly strict shelter-in-place orders have gone into effect to try to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The situation feels impossible for two-parent homes where both partners can work from home — and gets exponentially harder for single parents, kids with special needs, families experiencing homelessness, and parents who have to work outside of the home. Add financial worries, lack of proper technology for online distance learning, and logistical challenges like grocery shopping and managing outside time while social distancing, and it can feel downright paralyzing.

Every working parent of small children I know is truly not okay. I'm not talking about ""#MomLife! So stressful! Cold coffee! But so worth it!"" I'm talking about like, seriously on the verge of a breakdown, very understandably. How is this supposed to go on? — Jenée (@jdesmondharris) March 19, 2020

Chavie Lieber, a former Vox reporter now at Business of Fashion, has a 2-year-old son. She says her working hours have been completely disrupted. Her husband is an occupational therapist and is still leaving the house to work, though his hours have been cut. During a recent morning Zoom call with her co-workers, her son dumped an entire bag of flour all over the floor and himself.

“Between 9 and 2:30, I’m not getting anything done,” she says.

This morning I have a 9am



- standup for work

- zoom circle time for 4 yo

- google meeting for 1st grader



All. At. The. Same. Time.



Good morning to only those people having empathy for working parents right now. This is really difficult. — Amanda Goetz (@AmandaMGoetz) March 23, 2020

On the other side of the age spectrum are the teens, many of whom were getting their first taste of independence and are now housebound with the people they least want to be around at this stage of life: their parents. My two teen boys are resentful that they have to stay inside, and they miss their friends and activities. My 11th-grader’s SAT, which he’d been studying for for months, was canceled. They’ve been spending more hours online than ever.

To make this situation as tenable as possible, communicating with partners and employers, setting realistic expectations, and accepting that more screen time is inevitable will help ease the burden a bit. “For most parents, it’s completely resetting their reality. We’re unable to do the same things with work or caring for our children that we’ve been able to do in the past,” says Dave Anderson, a clinical psychologist and the senior director of national programs and outreach at the Child Mind Institute. “The first thing we’re talking to parents about is undermining their own sense of perfectionism and being exceedingly and radically realistic with themselves.”

In other words, go easy on yourself. You’re essentially being asked to perform two full-time jobs.

Don’t expect to work at your normal capacity

“Take the to-do list you had for today and cut it in half, then cut it in half again,” says Anderson.

Everyone is going to be less productive during this time. Being proactive with employers and co-workers and setting realistic expectations about what you can accomplish is necessary to prevent misunderstandings down the line. First, figure out what your optimal working hours will be, when you’ll be most available, and how much you think you can get done, says Jaime Klein, the CEO of Inspire Human Resources. Then request a scheduled video call with your boss. “The human brain still takes in so much information through nonverbals. The ability to not only hear the intonation but to see how a leader is receiving the information is incredibly important,” says Klein.

Klein also says to come armed with choices for your boss and give them options, which “gives them something to respond to and edit,” such as staggering shifts or moving meeting times. (Interestingly, offering choices is also a method that educators suggest for getting young children to comply with requests.)

Unfortunately, unconventional working hours are probably necessary. Lieber does most of her work after 2:30 until dinner, and then from 8 to 11 pm. Ann Vegdahl works in academia in New York City, and her husband is a software engineer. They have a 2-year-old son, and she is seven months pregnant. Her son is usually in day care for eight hours, but now all three are home together. Vegdahl primarily works when her son naps and then for several hours in the evening. She estimates she is only getting 40 to 50 percent of her usual workload accomplished, but her employer has thus far been understanding. “When [my son] goes down, I’m like, ‘Can I take a nap too?’ I laugh at the idea of schedules,” she says.

Still, Anderson recommends for two-parent homes with both partners at home to plan to work in shifts if possible, especially if there are small children that require more attention. Breaking it up into two- or four-hour shifts apiece can ensure that each partner has dedicated time to focus. But even then, be prepared to help out if things get tricky, especially if there are multiple children.

Anderson recommends setting a maximum of five goals for the day: one or two things you really need to accomplish at work, one or two things you want your kids to accomplish, and one family or partner activity, even if it’s crashing on the couch to watch TV for 30 minutes. Don’t expect to or try to do more, because you’ll get frustrated and even more stressed out.

“I’m used to getting a ton done and when this started, I didn’t shift my mentality. Now, I give myself two days to accomplish what I’d like to do in one day — professionally, personally, and otherwise,” Alexandra Mayzler, a mom of a 3- and 5-year-old and the founder of the Thinking Caps Group, says in an email.

Communicating ahead of time with partners can prevent fighting and stress during the day, too. “Though I’m doing most of the child care and homeschooling with our kids, every evening my husband and I go through our schedules and we block out an hour or two if there is something that I need to get done during regular business hours. Communicating ahead of time keeps things calm during the day,” says Mayzler.

Distance learning is a challenge for all age groups

“You’re not a teacher. Unless you already were planning to homeschool your kid, there’s no way to truly adapt to this,” says Anderson. “We are seeing compassion from schools where they are saying, ‘We know you’re not going to get it all done, we know they can’t complete the same curriculum as if they were in their classrooms.’” He recommends that parents reach out to their schools to “triage” and ask, “What are the most high-priority items I’ve got to get done during the day?”

Do I claim to have the patience and strength to be a perfect homeschooler for my children?



No.



But am I trying my hardest every day to be the best possible teacher I can be?



Also no.#imtired #nonstopcleaning #coronavirus — Jackie Goldschneider (@JGSchneid) March 20, 2020

Infants and toddlers arguably require the most hands-on care and the most attention, but all age groups come with their own challenges for working parents.

Vegdahl says she went to a local dollar store and bought tons of cheap toys and objects. Colored tape has been popular at her home. She’s used it to make “roads” through the apartment that her son drives his trucks on. Lieber says a $4 kazoo and daily baking keep her toddler happy. And both of them have taken advantage of the lockdown to potty train. “We’re not going out anywhere, and I now have time and patience. I go back and forth between wondering if I’m a masochist or if this is a good idea,” says Lieber.

For older children, schools vary widely on how they’re handling distance learning, from formal online classes to sending packets of work home. No matter what the workload is, at least a rudimentary schedule can be helpful for kids and parents alike — many kids are used to a structured school day.

“The most important thing is that kids need some sort of structure, whatever that routine and structure looks like for that family. That’s what’s been the most helpful,” says Jennifer Quinn, a school librarian and former elementary school teacher based in upstate New York. She has two children at home, ages 9 and 10; her son is blind. At one point she was sharing a laptop with her daughter, who was doing Zoom classes.

Quinn says that for kids older than 7, a checklist of tasks they can complete can be a good tool. She incorporates concepts like “choice time,” which they recognize from school. At home, this means they get to go to the basement and play with whatever (non-screen activity) they want to do down there. Once the checklist is complete, she lets her kids do a reward activity, like playing a video game.

Related What to do with your kids when schools are canceled

Quinn recommends that families look for online resources that jibe with their kids’ interests, otherwise the sheer number of them out there can be overwhelming. She also recommends reaching out to a librarian, who can steer families to specific resources in their communities that are relevant to their interests. For families looking for books, there is a program called Epic, which Quinn calls a “Netflix for books.” If a teacher or librarian invites you, you’ll get free access to e-books and audiobooks. (She doesn’t really recommend Audible’s free offerings, noting that the titles are “limited.”) Scribd has a similar program. She also recommends hunting down favorite authors’ Twitter feeds. Many are doing daily or weekly activities online.

Let’s be honest: Spare time is probably going to involve a lot more screens

Let’s all be honest that most of our kids, regardless of age, are probably going to be getting more screen time. Plopping your toddler or kindergartner in front of a Netflix cartoon or an iPad game while you get 45 minutes of critical work done is not the end of the world, especially during this stressful time for all of us.

For teens, the biggest battle might not be their school work but their social lives. In pre-Covid-19 days, my biggest fights with my two teen boys involved how much time they were spending online. Now I’m thankful they have the technology. I hear them playing video games and talking and hollering with friends on Discord and other platforms. My older son does FaceTime calls with his friends in the basement.

“So much of what is central to the teen experience is their social life,” says Anderson. He says some of the families he works with have allowed teens to go out in pairs and keep a safe social distance or meet in the hallways of apartment buildings while maintaining six feet.

This is a new normal for families now, and Anderson recommends checking in with other parent friends who can commiserate. Mostly, though, give yourself a break, he says. “Have some compassion for yourself and know that no one has experience juggling the range of things that many parents are currently juggling. Forgive yourself and tell yourself, ‘I’m going to get some sleep and wake up tomorrow morning and do it basically good enough. It doesn’t have to be perfect — just good enough.”",vox,https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/3/25/21193142/coronavirus-covid-19-kids-work-from-home-child-care-school-cancellations
"['Phil Christman', 'Mar']",2020-03-18,The danger of mythologizing America’s “heartland”,"Part of Issue #12 of The Highlight, our home for ambitious stories that explain our world.

The Midwest, in many people’s minds, is normal.

Probably no one, if pressed, could give a meaningful definition of the “normal” that the Midwest supposedly embodies, but there’s evidence of a stubborn belief in it everywhere.

When politicians like Pete Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar want to seem safe, trustworthy, wholesome, and pragmatic, they often do so by playing up their connections to the region. A study a few years ago (one of those studies only useful for documenting preexisting prejudices, but that’s the point) ranked Indiana our country’s most “normal” state. Social scientists have chosen the Midwest as an object of fascination precisely because they thought it offered, as Helen and Robert Lynd — sociologists who studied small-town American life — once wrote, a “common denominator” of America.

Some vestige of this belief may account for the power granted to Iowa by our primary process. Most of all, pop culture normalizes the region: Think about how differently we would read the myth of Superman if his ship crashed in rural Connecticut, or how Fargo loses its irony (and everything else) if reimagined in Fargo, Arkansas. It must be Kansas that Dorothy returns to, not Schenectady or Dallas.

Anytime a region this large, this diverse, and this hard to define becomes a symbol for a concept that has the combined vagueness and life-regulating power of “normalcy,” it should tell us that we’re in the presence of myth. In its worst form, the association between Midwesternness and normalcy can become a proxy for whiteness, straightness, and/or maleness. There are people in the world who think that our outer-borough, rich-guy, New Yorker president better represents the Midwest than does Ilhan Omar, a Somali immigrant elected in 2018 to the House of Representatives from Minnesota, where she has lived for more than 20 years. This kind of thinking legitimizes prejudice while obscuring the region’s actual demographics, which are all over the place.

All that said, the idea’s appeal is powerful. Normalcy can give safety, warmth, the smugness of a person whose plate is full. It can make us feel invulnerable, passed over by history and its dangers, too broad for the grave, durable enough to survive biblical conflagration or climate change or, say, an ill-handled and sudden pandemic. Because it attracts us, normal-ness becomes a fetish, a performance, or a product. The Midwest, because of its perceived averageness, has long been forced to play a symbolic role in this process.

For all its appeal, normalcy is also alienating. I meet many Midwesterners who seem honestly to believe that their experiences are too banal for description, and, especially in my teaching, I meet young people who are so angry at themselves for their normal-ness that they can neither enjoy their lives nor change them. Among people who are less political — that is, among people who lean toward the right and don’t know it — you often hear a kind of general regret, a sense of having missed something, having blown a chance. The Midwest seems to offer us the chance to become normal, but what this means in practice is a paranoid sense that you’ve missed something irrevocable.

But precisely because it is a myth, the perceived normalcy of the Midwest does tell us a lot about ourselves. Myths always do. Early-20th-century American historians, intellectuals, writers, and politicians consciously constructed our image of the Midwest as the place where America averaged itself out.

The region’s myth and its name emerged around the same time. For a long time, I assumed — as do many people I’ve asked — that people say “Middle West,” or “Midwest” because they’re talking about the part of the country that had once been “the West,” but was less so as the country’s borders moved farther in that direction. It turns out that this isn’t true. Instead, it emerged in the early 20th century as a way of describing a region that was widely seen, illogically, as both dynamic and reassuringly old-fashioned. The name wasn’t about geography or history but the image of the place: halfway between city and country, rural past and industrialized future. It’s not “middle” in that it’s the middle of the country (just look at a map). It’s “middle” in the way a middle-aged person is considered to be “middle”: It’s even-tempered, mature. It’s America, aged just right.

Not accidentally, the 1910s and ’20s were the period when historian Frederick Jackson Turner enjoyed great scholarly and popular success. You may or may not recognize the name, but his influence on both historians and general readers has been vast. He first presented his influential “Frontier Thesis” in his 1893 essay “The Significance of the Frontier in American History.” He argued that as the American frontier successively moved west — via war with and removal of Native Americans, the Louisiana Purchase, the Gold Rush, and the Homestead Act — the same five stages of civilization continually played themselves out.

First there were Native Americans and white frontiersmen disrupted by traders, who make room for pastoralists, who are followed by farmers and eventually farm towns, which yield to manufacturers, and, finally, cities. This thesis appealed to historians because, among other things, it offered a simple answer to the question “What is distinctive about the United States?” In an era defined by nationalism, this question seemed to need answering. The moving panorama of Turner’s five stages offered a visual image of what made the US special among nations. As Turner developed his ideas, he came to see the Middle West as the part of America tasked with “adapting democracy to the vast economic organization of the present.” It was where raw pioneer vigor and complex social organization lay together on a feather mattress, and what they produced was not simply people or a way of life but the American character itself.

Contemporary historians dispute virtually every aspect of Turner’s argument, but its sheer convenience made the narrative he created hard to pass up. Sociologists and social critics, historians, novelists — none of them could resist a concept that seemed to offer the Midwest (an abbreviation that caught on in midcentury) as a place where you could get direct access to what was “truly” American. And given how often Americans have tended to see ourselves, to position ourselves, as the latest or final stage of human history — the world’s “last best hope,” as an Illinois president once put it — it gives the Midwest an almost religious significance. Here, humanity has finally arrived.

There is something deeply unsettling in the idea that one has already arrived. It provokes disappointment on the one hand — is this all? — and anxiety on the other, a sense that one is not yet fit somehow. It leads to a strange kind of self-contempt and self-alienation.

When I was a teenager growing up in Michigan, I felt that if the place I lived in was normality incarnate, then normality itself was the wrong fit for me. If history seemed like something that happened to other people, located elsewhere, so did the future. I had no expectations for it; it hadn’t even occurred to me to have expectations for it. Why rush your way into more of the same?

Sometimes I walked over to the 76 gas station, where two friends of mine worked the night shift. There they conducted a kind of ongoing dirtbag salon: free drinks from the soda fountain, Dead Milkmen on the tape player. One evening, a guy I vaguely knew who had graduated high school early stopped to buy milk. We walked to his house, and he spoke a truth about his life that was so obvious and so personal that I’d never acknowledged it was also the truth of mine: I had to get out of here. It was so lonely.

The Midwest in books and movies has given us some of our classic images of loneliness, a sense of impermanence on the landscape, of a fragile hold on the place you call home. Think of the man in Sherwood Anderson’s Winesburg, Ohio, who writes his thoughts on scraps of paper and then throws them on the ground. Or Evan S. Connell’s Mrs. Bridge, calling from her garage to no one. Of Toni Morrison’s Sula, whose singularity isolates her even as it makes her a kind of hero.

Sociologists and social critics, historians, novelists — none could resist the concept of the Midwest as a place where you could get direct access to what was “truly” American

The alternative to this loneliness is to grapple with the particularity of Midwestern lives and Midwestern history. The region was never normal. The mythmaking of writers like Turner smooths out a long history of Midwestern struggles over worker power and human rights, land speculation and Indian removal. It also papers over a long history of resistance to these sorts of depredations.

From the 1870s to the 1920s, the Midwest was swept by the Granger, Populist, and Progressive movements in turn, and all of these movements struggled to reconcile the imperative to represent “ordinary Americans” in their fight against a wealthy elite, and the short-term gains that could come from defining “ordinary Americans” in racially exclusive ways. These movements were largely white; indeed, one goal of the Grangers was to reunite Northern and Southern farmers through a common cause. Some Populists, on the other hand, initially attacked Jim Crow and envisioned a coalition of low-income people of all races. This multiracial solidarity was a promising development. Nearly 130 years later, it ... remains promising, as beautiful and elusive things do.

Midwestern history offers us visions more radical and more particular than these. In the early 19th century, Native American leaders and intellectuals from the modern-day Midwest, such as Tenskwatawa, Tecumseh, and later Black Hawk, helped create the idea of pan-Indian resistance to colonization — including the idea of “Native American” as a unified identity. Religious groups and social experimenters built communal would-be utopias all throughout the region in the 1830s and 1840s, some of which you can still visit (Amana, Iowa; New Harmony, Indiana). One historian credits Brooklyn, Illinois, with the distinction of being the first all-black town in America — a town founded on the idea, surely as radical in the 19th century as communism, that black Americans could be free.

The Midwest is also dotted with formerly radical and utopian communities, towns, villages, and colleges founded for the sole purpose of resisting the spread of slavery. If we see the auto industry as Midwestern, we should see the labor power that grew in that crucible as Midwestern too. The Movement for Black Lives, created in 2014 as a response to the national visibility of racist police brutality, is partly a Midwestern creation — it began with the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, grew at a Cleveland conference, and shut down a Minnesota airport terminal. The resistance white supremacist Richard Spencer met in Michigan was one of the reasons he scaled back his public appearances. Today, Immigration and Customs Enforcement struggles to find a Midwestern city that will let it build a detention camp because of Midwestern anti-racist and anti-fascist activism.

For Frederick Jackson Turner, the Midwest was the place where the nation on the leading edge of history found equilibrium. But it’s actually a site of ongoing, ever-changing political struggle. As Midwesterners think about how to live decently together in a warmer, more crowded place, it is this history, not the myth of their own banality, to which they need to turn. This history also helps us see the particularity of the place — which is to say, it makes it easier to see with love. At the same time, the squareness of the place, the repetition with slight variation, reminds us that each part of it, each person in it, is itself by the slenderest of chances. You feel, wandering the Midwest, like your town could have been any of these towns, like you could have been any of these people.

This feeling, like our history, points more than one way. It can make you ingrown, like a toenail: Why can’t I get the break I’m supposed to? But it can also cause you to think of those other selves: that poorer self, that queerer self, that darker self, that privileged self. It can tell you that you must try to care for all those selves as though they were you — as though you were made from the same soil and headed back to it. In this night-black, dirt-black dark, who even knows for sure who they are, who I am? Or who we might yet be?

"['Nicole Dieker', 'Mar']",2020-03-24,Money Talks: This family declared bankruptcy. Now they’re figuring out how to rebuild.,"Welcome to Money Talks, a series in which we interview people about their relationships with money, their relationships with each other, and how those relationships inform one another.

Running Balance is a newsletter about a family of four living at 200 percent of the poverty line. Mrs. Running Balance is bringing in the family income, Mr. Running Balance is a stay-at-home dad, and they have a 3-year-old and an 18-month-old. The Running Balances recently declared bankruptcy and are sharing their income and expenses online so people can understand what it’s really like to raise two children in Houston on $47,000 a year.

The following remarks have been lightly condensed and edited for clarity.

Mr. RB: It’s been this kind of weird learning curve, especially since having kids. When you’re two single people living around 200 percent of the poverty line, you can be as flexible as you need to be. Once you have kids, you can’t put off something for them. You become so much more acutely aware of where your finances are falling short.

Mrs. RB: In 2014, when I was 28 years old, I moved back to my hometown and accepted a receptionist position making $33,000 a year. I was single, and I was like, “I think I can make that work on my own!” Then I called my now-husband, who was my former high school boyfriend (we dated for, like, a week in high school), and he was living with his parents while freelancing and going to school, and then we just kind of moved in together, and then we just kind of got married, and then we just kind of had kids, and there was no real point where we got financially prepared to have kids. It was just like, oh, this is happening.

Mr. RB: We’re in a major metro area, so rent is very expensive, especially if you need to find room for kids. We’re living in an 800-square-foot apartment with a 3-year-old and an 18-month-old. [Editor’s note: Rent for this apartment is $1,050 a month.] Until very recently, most of the rest of our money went toward credit cards.

Mrs. RB: When our bankruptcy attorney pulled my credit report, it came out to about $53,000 in debt; $9,000 is from a joint card I had with my mother that I didn’t know about, so that isn’t technically ours, but the rest is for sure.

Mr. RB: Having kids turned out to be a lot more expensive than we thought it would be. Literally the process of all those appointments. During the pregnancies for both of our children, Mrs. RB was still hourly, so anything you’re missing for a doctor’s appointment is actual hours off, and both times she had to go on bed rest for high-risk pregnancies. That’s a huge part of our debt.

“We just kind of moved in together, and then we just kind of got married, and then we just kind of had kids, and there was no real point where we got financially prepared to have kids”

Mrs. RB: My husband and I came up with an estimate of about $7,000, which includes $5,000 in lost wages, combined over the two pregnancies. We were so lucky, too, compared to a lot of people. I didn’t get maternity leave, but I got short-term disability, so I was really lucky that I was able to get 80 percent of my pay while I was on bed rest and for 10 weeks after both of my C-sections. But taking a 20 percent pay cut on back-to-back years was a real hit financially.

We started putting things on the cards in emergencies — there were times when we would go out to eat where we probably shouldn’t have because we couldn’t afford it, but more often we would spend all the money we had and then we’d need to get diapers or formula or groceries, and it would go on the credit card, and the next month the credit card minimum would be higher, so we’d pay the minimum and would have less money for groceries and diapers and formula. So it kind of got to be this vicious cycle.

Mr. RB: We started considering bankruptcy when we began thinking about moving states, from Texas to Washington, and were looking at, “Okay, if we want to move into a job search and possibly have to go off any kind of savings and start really trying to save money, how much would we need to save?” We are lucky to have the opportunity to stay with a family member when we get there, so we won’t have to immediately save a first-last-deposit situation, but we started looking at it and said, “Oh, we’ll never be able to save enough money to last even a few weeks, not with the amount of debt payments we’re making.” Even if we don’t have to pay rent for a month, there was just going to be no way.

I looked at Mrs. Running Balance one day and said, “We don’t have debtor’s prison. We could just not pay this.” She was like, “But then how would we get a house?”

Mrs. RB: I’m a really big rule follower, so I was kind of screaming internally when he said that. But then we came to the realization that if we ever wanted a house, we have no money, so we’d have to save money — and we can’t save money the way we’re doing now. So if a bankruptcy is going to be on my credit report for seven years, we weren’t going to be able to buy a house in that amount of time anyway if we didn’t declare bankruptcy.

Since that was really the only reason holding me back — also the rule-following, and the stigma of it, that was something to get over — we just realized that, in our case, maybe it did make sense to clear it out and start over.

We reached out to a bankruptcy lawyer and did a consultation, and she had us write down all of our debts and all of our assets, and then she said, “This is a pretty clear-cut Chapter 7 case, and you’ll be able to walk away from it. You’ll be able to keep your car if you keep making your payments, and you won’t have to give up your clothes or your children’s toys because there are exemptions for all of that.” So we went ahead and went forward with that, and although we’re still in the process of finalizing it, it’s been such a huge relief. Like, the mental stress of it, I can’t even describe to you.

Mr. RB: When I was 21, I was living check-to-check and I took out a payday loan under the advice of a neighbor. Then I was under the same payday loan for a year and a half, because if you’re somebody who’s taking out a payday loan, you’re never going to make up that initial shortfall to pay back the loan and the interest and also not need money for rent and food and living.

The credit cards — I kind of realized that it was like a payday loan in slow motion. You were never going to make up the shortfall without a significant positive financial change.

Mrs. RB: We just realized that we were never going to make enough money, unless — and this is literally how I paid off my student loans, my father died and I used his life insurance policy to pay off my loans. That’s kind of where I was with the credit cards, where I was, I don’t know, going to pay the minimums for another 20 years, until one of us got an inheritance and we could clear them out.

Mr. RB: I think the single biggest big-picture thing for us, having the two kids, is looking at a house before they’re out of elementary school. I grew up sharing a bedroom with my twin brother for most of my childhood, and being just on top of each other, there’s no space to do anything in a small apartment, and that was the biggest impetus for the bankruptcy. It was like, “Oh, we’re never going to get out from under this.” We were never going to be able to afford a house.

In researching bankruptcy, one of the No. 1 scare tactics is “no matter how far you are in debt, whatever you do, don’t declare bankruptcy because people won’t want to give you a home loan.” But if you’re so far in debt, it’s not like you’re on the precipice of homeownership. It’s not like, “Oh, if we could just make the payments for a couple more months, we’ll be in a four-bedroom.”

Mrs. RB: I grew up in apartments inside the city with a single mom, and we moved every year or every two years, and that’s something I don’t necessarily want my kids to have to do. It was fine, but to have a better sense of stability for them is something that’s important to us.

Mr. RB: As soon as we stopped paying the credit cards, we were all of a sudden saving money. The ever-increasing credit card debt we found ourselves in was kind of a budgeting boot camp, because we were like, “We have to stop putting money on these cards but we have to keep making the payments.” Now that we’re not making the payments, we have the same financial discipline, but the money is not just evaporating. We have a small savings account now — literally very small, hundreds of dollars, but it’s there.

“If you’re so far in debt, it’s not like you’re on the precipice of homeownership. It’s not lik, ‘Oh, if we could just make the payments for a couple more months, we’ll be in a four-bedroom.’”

Mrs. RB: Our biggest struggle is eating outside of the house, but other than that, we’ve cut our expenses pretty close to the bone.

Mr. RB: It was insane to find ourselves so far in debt, because we have none of the physical things that you’d associate with people winding up in debt. We don’t have a fancy car, we don’t have a lot of clothes — I think both of us have five outfits each — and our TV cost $108 from Walmart.

That said, the theme of the Running Balance blog seems to be “sometimes you have to get Chipotle.” Our family is struggling, but we just spent $23 on chips and salsa. We used to say that we would never eat out, but any time you say you’re never going to do something, you actually end up doing it more. Instead of having the planned release valve, you end up saying, “This just has to happen today.” Then, two days later, because it’s not on the schedule, you say, “Okay, more Chipotle!”

Mrs. RB: This is our first paycheck where we’re actually budgeting for eating out: $50 per paycheck, or $100 a month. Honestly, budgeting $100 a month toward eating out still feels a little outrageous to me, even though I know we’re spending that much even if we don’t budget. With two kids and a tiny apartment kitchen, to be able to get a meal outside of the house once a week is a reasonable goal.

Mr. RB: There’s nothing our kids hate more than seeing me on the other side of a baby gate with a bunch of hot pans going. Plus, when you’ve got two howling babies and your partner says, “Why don’t we get fast food, I had a terrible day,” the emotional stakes of going, “No, I don’t think that should happen; tell me more about how bad your day was, but no greasy nuggets for you,” are pretty high.

Mrs. RB: There’s a lot of talk in the news about people who receive government benefits and people who are in poverty, and it’s really hard to see those people as human sometimes. Part of starting the Running Balance newsletter, for me, was to put my voice out there. I’m a nice person, I work a good job, but we are also struggling. I wanted to shine a light on people who have the same kind of issues that we do.

This interview took place before the spread of Covid-19 changed many of our lives; I got back in touch with the Running Balances to learn how the coronavirus was affecting them financially, and here is Mrs. Running Balance’s response:

Mrs. RB: I’m so, so lucky that my job is letting me telecommute for the foreseeable future, so we aren’t worried about making rent or paying bills.

My bankruptcy lawyer finally got back to me after a period of no communication and gave me a case number, which means everything has been filed and I should get a court date in the mail by the end of this week. (Assuming courts stay open?) On top of the virus stuff, I’ve been getting about five or six calls a day from credit card companies, so that will be a huge weight off.

We dipped into savings to get more groceries the day before payday (last Friday) because our usual grocery store got cleaned out and I was admittedly spooked by it. We went to a different grocery chain near our house and stocked up on five gallons of milk (not as drastic as it sounds with two toddlers), eggs, diapers, potatoes, and some household essentials we were running low on. (A package of toilet paper, dish soap, laundry detergent, and tissues.)

We did break our one-streaming-service-at-a-time rule and signed up for a trial of Disney+ that we’re probably not going to cancel.

I’m expecting to spend more on charging the car this month since I’m not charging for free at work. I’m also expecting to have to pay overages for data for our home internet with all of the streaming we’ll be doing, not just kid shows but also virtual meetings that I’ll need to be in. But we have almost no other expenses since we can’t really leave the house.

We haven’t eaten out in a week and have no plans to going forward. It just feels like too big of a health risk.

"['Jimin Kang', 'Mar']",2020-03-21,"I’m an international student 7,000 miles away from family. Loneliness is my new reality.","My family spends their days holed up in our ninth-floor apartment in Seoul, protecting themselves from the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea. But I’m not with them — I’m stuck 7,000 miles away in my dorm room in New Jersey, grappling with the knowledge that most of my classmates have either already moved out or will be gone by the end of the week.

As an international student from a high-risk country, I will be part of a handful of students allowed to remain on a campus that has been traumatically emptied out. This creeping sense of loneliness is a new normal I have to get used to, as everything I’ve grown familiar with has changed, quite literally, overnight.

Watching parents help their children move out earlier this week, I felt stuck between wanting to go home and being scared to do so. As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, so does the fear among international students like myself — of which there are currently over a million in the United States — that travel restrictions and health risks may bar us from returning home even once the academic year comes to an end. And we, too, will have to leave our dorms then.

If we cannot return to our countries, where will we go next? And if we do get to leave, will we get to come back? Also on my mind are logistical concerns: If I were to leave but not allowed to return, what would happen to my academic visa in the fall? What about my friends who were caught in the middle of applying to postgraduate visas when the coronavirus shook our lives? Will they get to stay, too, in this country?

Yet heavier than the logistical burdens are the emotional ones. Ever since last week when Princeton declared that all students were required to leave campus, with some exceptions, and all classes would switch to online learning, I’ve been reflecting on loneliness. It crossed my mind when I watched students singing classic Queen and ABBA hits on a lawn near my dorm room, or when I baked one last cake at my co-op, hugged my senior friends goodbye, and sat in my room afterward, alone, trying to make sense of it all.

But I am familiar with loneliness, and specifically the variety that stems from being far from home. Although this loneliness is hard to bear at times, I admit it is also a twisted badge of honor: that I made the sacrifice to become a lonely child miles and miles from home, in the hope of repaying the sacrifices my family made to get me here in the first place.

For three years, I’ve put 12-hour plane rides between myself and my loved ones for the sake of a “good education,” which, for my whole life, I’ve been told I had to leave home to attain. I’ve left behind home-cooked dinners and family nights in search of vaguely defined notions of “better opportunities” abroad.

That sacrifice has meant milestones I have never had in college: my parents moving me in, coming for parents’ weekend, inviting my friends home for dinner. Every Thanksgiving, my friends in New Jersey have so kindly welcomed me into their homes. I’ve been grateful for having a seat at their tables, yet a little sad that my mother, who has a sweet tooth, has never tasted homemade pumpkin pie. This loneliness is compounded by the way this country defines me: a “non-immigrant alien,” a perpetual outsider in a category defined by what I’m not, rather than what I am.

I know that being the perpetual foreigner was a trade-off I willingly signed up for when I chose to leave home, and, I’m also aware, it’s an incredible privilege. Besides, in an age of technology, I’m never too far from those I love — virtually, that is, through video chatting, group chats, and email. It is jarring, however, to know that technology will soon be all I ever know. As classes move online, tech will not just be my connection to home, but to my friends and to my learning, and it doesn’t feel right at all.

Now the remaining student body at Princeton numbers in the few hundreds — a stark contrast with the thousands that filled the labs, libraries, and sports fields just two weeks ago. My residential hall is eerily quiet; board games sit untouched in the lounge and the washing machines sit empty and dry. Meals are served twice daily — in disposable take-out containers — in the one cafeteria that remains open out of the usual roster of six, served by staff who are kind and caring and worrying about kids and their families back home.

Across many campuses, there are international students like us, navigating two worlds.

After winter break in my junior year, I had a layover in Beijing on my way to Newark from Seoul, just days before the coronavirus began spreading in China. As I waited in the non-citizen line to clear immigration at the airport, I noticed that everyone around me was a student: lined up one after another, we held our immigration documents at our chests, fiddling with our signal-deprived phones. When it came time to approach an agent, each person had their well-practiced stories: where they were going, where they had been, why they were here, now, in Newark Airport, asking to be let back in. In our acts of self-justification was a quiet solidarity that none of us spoke of. But I felt deeply that day in my jet-lagged body, moved to be among those who understood, how important that solidarity can be.

As the virus spreads, dissolving the transnational bonds that have helped me reach the United States in the first place, I find myself wondering how my companions in that airport queue are doing today. I know that, as classes move online and students are told to move out all across the country, everyone is hurting. But international students face a unique situation. To us, the coronavirus is a stark reminder of how far we are from home. Small gestures — like checking in on us — can mean everything. Offers of open homes and emotional support can feel like blessings in this land far from family.

It is a lonely time for all of us. A simple greeting, whether on the phone or computer, can offer warmth that slowly chips away at the isolation.

"['Luke Taylor', 'Mar']",2020-03-21,"When coronavirus is behind us, will you still think of restaurant and bar workers?","It happened quickly. On Monday we were getting emails about hand sanitizer at every station, by Wednesday we weren’t accepting cash, by Friday midday we got an email about new menu items, and within an hour we were closed indefinitely. Nitehawk, a little indie dine-in movie theater staring at Manhattan across the water from Brooklyn, was an immovable staple of Williamsburg nightlife — or at least that’s what I thought after running food to sold-out theaters for a year and a half. But here we are. My last shift was a brunch shift, so empty the chef could have taken the orders, prepped and made the food, served it, bussed it, and cleaned up all by himself.

On Saturday, we went to the bar to pick up food that would otherwise have been bound for the dumpster. We found it all laid out like an impromptu street market, burger buns and chips stacked high, kale going dark at the edges.

It’s a scene playing out all across the country, from the epicenters of coronavirus outbreaks in California, New York City, and Washington state to cities and towns and roadside diners even in rural America; at least 25 states have mandated the closure of restaurants, but with how fast the news is going, by the time you get to the period at the end of this sentence, that number may have grown. But even without a mandate, so many of these small businesses operate on such thin margins that most will look at their books in the coming weeks and months and find there is no other option. So where does that leave the nation’s 15.6 million restaurant workers?

Most people go through life never really having to think about the server, the busser, the barback, the line cook, or the dishwasher — just figures in black, just glimpses of people as you grab your coat and head out the door. But who are we, we nighttime people swimming through the dark streets, on the crosstown at 3 am, nodding off on the night’s last bus, sitting on the milk crates by the dumpster smoking a loosie and watching the cars on the overpass, smiling when we feel like screaming, dancing until the day interrupts us?

If you took the time to look, you might see the whole of us, the work relationship that blew up on us, the burn of dishwater on our forearms that doesn’t feel so bad a year in, the unpaid loans, the dirty aprons, the leftover food snuck home because we had only 10 bucks for the week, the drunk nights, the early days, and all the friends you had for just a little while.

Insofar as everyone must justify their existence against the market, we are an economic force. Jobs in the industry have grown by 84 percent between 2010 and 2018, according to the National Restaurant Association, and in the ever-venerated field of small business, locally owned restaurants employ nearly 8 million people, the second-largest number of any industry. As the Dow struggles to regain its footing, and people begin to accept that they may not see the inside of their favorite haunt until summer, the true power of our departure is only starting to be felt. But in the numbers, we once again lose the people.

We’re the dreaming people, the striving people, the laughing people. We’re painters and playwrights, comedians, dancers, animators, entrepreneurs, students, musicians, actors, drag queens, skate punks, and amateur boxers. We’re immigrants, from Ecuador, El Salvador, Senegal, the Philippines, and Iowa. We’re new fathers hoping to do it a little bit better. We’re old vets, cuts and burns writing their sentences over the tattoos on our forearms. We speak Creole and Spanish and Hindi. We work three jobs — babysitting, security, freelance PA work, selling weed, teaching yoga, bartending at another restaurant, taking care of our little cousins. We’re working on master’s degrees and business plans. We’ve got schemes and big ideas, weird shows and poetry readings. That’s me, that’s my people, caught at a glance through swinging doors.

Our lives are held together with duct tape; the system sucks it all out from us as soon as we get it. How are you ever going to get three months’ savings when your rent is two-thirds of the money you make and your loans are all the rest? How are you ever going to write your novel when you work 12 hours a day between two jobs?

Forty percent of Americans say they can’t deal with a $400 financial emergency, but now that emergency has come, for all of us, all at once. Most of us don’t know how we’re going to pay rent in a week — and beyond that is a dark jungle of unformed life that seems impossible to hack our way through. What happens now? How do we live? Nowhere is hiring, and bills are still coming. My greatest pillar of support, it seems, is from a Cinema Worker Solidarity Fund on GoFundMe. All these people are out in the cold, and we’ve barely started to grapple with how to help them.

Some economist somewhere, or more likely, a horde of them, is calculating what all this sudden loss will mean for the GDP, that highest measure of our livelihoods. But as historian Rutger Bregman (who had his moment of fame telling the billionaires at Davos to pay their taxes) points out in his book Utopia for Realists, the GDP hides as much as it reveals. “Community service, clean air, free refills on the house — none of these things make the GDP an iota bigger. … And that’s to say nothing of all the unpaid labor that doesn’t even qualify ... from volunteering to child care to cooking, which together represents more than half of all our work.”

It is that kind of work — the kind for which there is little or no financial remuneration — that makes a community. Free concerts at the park, classes at the library, one-woman shows, book clubs, volunteer work, community theater, and open mics are pursuits that require a person to also find a “survival job.” In other words, the very kind of work that puts someone in the service industry.

After this is all over, there will be a massive stock-taking, but if we only look at the numbers, we’ll miss something ineffable. Even if we won’t admit it, we tend to think that wealth measures a person. It telegraphs how much they have contributed, and what they are worth in the end. Every customer service worker can see it: the way a person walks into a store, how they get your attention. But I grant it nothing; all the wealth, the power, the status, the view from the 63rd floor doesn’t mean I hold you higher than the prep cook listening to her textbooks for night school on tape while she cuts a barrel full of Brussels sprouts. Human worth is that deep-down stuff, and our economy has missed it completely.

Part of modern working-class life in America, before Covid-19, is knowing that all those varied people will move along. They’ll find their way out of a survival job, or life will just hit them too hard one day, and they’ll miss a shift and get fired, or they’ll find a better gig, or any one of a thousand quiet ways people leave a restaurant or bar. They become a Facebook friend, an Instagram follow, and drift back into the static. Sometimes you think back on them and wonder if you ever knew them quite well enough to call them up and talk about nothing at all. You think, “Maybe I could have tried to know them a little more.”

At Nitehawk, like at restaurants around the country, it happened all at once. Seeing each other in the restaurant, at our little market gathering supplies for an uncertain future, it had the air of the last day of school, stretched tight over a well of panic. The final indignity of the moment, standing amid piles of spoiling food, seeing my friends on the edge of breakdowns, was that I couldn’t even give them a hug goodbye.

Some of us got drunk that night, the last time we’d be around other people for maybe months, hopping from apartment to apartment until the night grew long and we all went home, wondering if we’d ever see each other again. I could feel millions of people I’ll never meet, all over the country, playing their own variation of that same song.

A job isn’t a family, it’s a refuge in a river. But now we’ve all been swept away. Every working person in the United States who doesn’t have the luxury of working from home is now forced to choose between danger and exhaustion or poverty and uncertainty.

What is this moment going to show us when we look back on it? We’re now seeing the necessity of each industry and the people who comprise it in turn. Surprisingly, we’re finding that it’s the forgotten jobs we’re learning to appreciate most — the service industry worker, the grocery store clerk, the delivery person, the social worker, the teacher, the nurse.

Perhaps we ought to reorder our thinking on who builds a world worth living in, and then build a system that supports those people, not only now but always, because this crisis is one part pandemic but also one part systemic failure. A world of runaway economic inequality leaves our foundations shaky. Now, we are seeing the consequences — not just in the numbers, but for the people.

"['Kelsey Piper', 'Mar']",2020-03-20,I live in the first US city ordered to “shelter in place.” Here’s what it’s like.,"Share All sharing options for: I live in the first US city ordered to “shelter in place.” Here’s what it’s like.

Monday afternoon, I took the baby to the park. He is too little to appreciate it. He mostly stares at me, unless the sun is in his eyes, in which case he closes them. We go to the park for my sake. I like feeling like the kind of normal person who goes to the park with a baby and is not living in the middle of the apocalypse.

That same afternoon, six counties that make up the San Francisco Bay Area declared that their 6 million residents would, effective at midnight, be subject to a “shelter in place” law that bans nonessential activities and gatherings. Most businesses have shut down, except the ones that do the work necessary to keep society running, and essentially all leisure activities involving other people are now illegal. Grocery trips and trips for medical care and essential household supplies are allowed. Going over to your friend’s house is a misdemeanor. It’s one step short of a lockdown.

No one really knows how this will end. The shelter-in-place law is for three weeks, through April 7, though the counties warn they might extend or shorten it, based on the facts on the ground. On Thursday night, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that a similar order will be put in place for the entire state. That order is in place “until further notice.”

In the meantime, the bookstore at the end of my block is now closed. Schools are closed. Most offices are closed. Bars are closed. Restaurants are only allowed to serve takeout.

I’d been avoiding those places for weeks now anyway, trying to do my part to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But things I hadn’t been avoiding are banned now, too, like having a friend over for dinner, or meeting a friend at a trailhead for a hike. My roommate who is a nanny scanned the rules desperately trying to figure out if her job was prohibited. (Answer: Child care for people doing essential work is permitted.) Sitting in the grass at this park with the baby would be permitted, as long as we didn’t come within 6 feet of anyone in the course of getting there. I suspect, nonetheless, it’ll be our last trip for a while.

The Bay Area is the first place in the US to pass a shelter-in-place law to address the coronavirus pandemic. And it won’t be the last. Mayor Bill de Blasio has warned New Yorkers that they should expect one soon.

At least they get a warning — for us in the Bay Area, the Monday announcement was a complete shock. County and city websites buckled under a sudden surge in traffic. The San Francisco Chronicle says that as the news broke, 1 percent of the 6.3 million people in the Bay Area were reading its article explaining the orders.

We spent Monday night scrambling. A roommate’s boyfriend lives alone and would be prohibited from all human contact for the three weeks as the rules are written. And it might be longer. But if we move him in by midnight, that’s allowed, right? Another roommate’s boyfriend cancels a visit. Two friends come by for a last hug. One of them lives alone, too. Will he be okay? Depends on how long it is.

We’re not angry at the county government. We’re proud of them, mostly. We’re stressed, scared, and uncertain, but optimistic we can stem the growth in case numbers before our medical system is overwhelmed like other medical systems have been. We’re hoping our community’s doctors and nurses won’t collapse on their feet from too many 24-hour shifts if these measures are sufficient. They have to be. Right?

Life under the new law

Midnight arrives.

We’re “sheltering in place” now.

It’s weird how much being locked down feels different from staying home voluntarily. We’d decided weeks ago we should avoid others, do our part in preventing this pandemic from overrunning hospitals. But now that it’s required, it’s stressful.

It’s even more stressful to imagine what will have to happen if these measures aren’t sufficient. It might be years before things can return to normal.

On Tuesday morning, I went out for a walk to look at my city under shelter-in-place. The walk is permitted as long as I don’t go within 6 feet of anyone. “It is a crime (a misdemeanor) not to follow the Order (although the intent is not for anyone to get into trouble)”, says the FAQ from my county.

The sidewalks aren’t 6 feet wide; I think I am technically committing a crime when my neighbor passes me, walking his dog.

The park, which is usually full of children, has only two. There are people about, but not many. Aside from the bookstore, the stores nearby generally fall under the “essential business” category — laundromats, convenience stores, gas stations, Subway, a dry cleaning place. They’re open but empty. It’s unclear what percentage of businesses count as “essential.”

Meanwhile, there is not a whiff of enforcement. The police department in my city, Oakland, is understaffed and has been facing unrelated tumult. If enforcement is needed, I suspect it’ll have to be the National Guard. It’s a terrifying thought, even though I know they’re on our side.

The streets aren’t empty, but they’re quieter than usual. A friend posts an image from Google Maps of traffic congestion in the Bay, the highways usually a nightmarish red at rush hour and not much better the rest of the time. “bay area all in green for st. patrick’s day,” she writes.

Nonessential employees should be home. Reality is more complicated.

Hours before we are to shelter in place, some friends get emails claiming that their employers are essential services and that employees must show up to work. A friend works for an enormous conglomerate whose health care department makes coronavirus tests — definitely essential services. But his office of about 80 people works on something different. “Colleagues are expected to report for their regular shifts,” the company emailed him.

The Bay Area is full of tech companies like this where it is questionable whose services within them are essential. Elon Musk emails Tesla employees to tell them that the factory will remain open. He says it’s “totally ok” if they want to stay home (though their supervisors clarified they’ll have to use their sick or vacation time). Musk thinks the coronavirus panic is overblown. Why is Tesla an essential service when so many other companies are not? (In fact, the county told Tesla it was not an essential service, and the company has now said that it will shut down on Monday. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from Vox.)

Because there is so little clarity, people on Facebook are asking each other what’s allowed and what isn’t, and sharing advice about the process for wrongful termination claims if someone is fired for trying to get their company to take the orders seriously.

There’s a sense of patriotism, of courage, of civic duty, but it’s stifled and poorly directed. We want to serve our country, but we don’t know how. We want to save our neighbors, but we don’t know how. On many of the most critical questions, the experts don’t know either.

I try to imagine our county officials, facing immense human suffering from the shutdown and immense human suffering from the pandemic, trying to figure out which tragedy would be the smaller one once all the bodies are counted. I’d expected them to be paralyzed by the decision and default to inaction. They didn’t do that, and I’m grateful.

Fighting to flatten the curve

I check Bay Area coronavirus cases. Even if the shelter-in-place order works perfectly, the numbers won’t start declining yet. Italy’s lockdown happened on March 9. New cases continued to surge for five or six days — the average incubation period of the virus. Now, a week later, new case numbers seem to be flattening. Maybe we can pull off the same thing before our hospitals are overwhelmed. (As of Thursday, there are 51 new cases in the Bay Area.)

My friend with cancer has her doctor’s permission to take out her own sutures from her recent surgery, if hospitals get overwhelmed. But maybe they won’t. Maybe we can extinguish this thing. California has a population similar to that of South Korea. Perhaps we can turn things around like they did.

There is so much we don’t know about this virus and the situation it has put us in. We don’t know how many cases are asymptomatic. We don’t know how many people in the US have the virus but haven’t been tested yet. We don’t know if people who have recovered already have immunity at all, or how long it lasts if they do. There are so many unknowns that ought to shape our response and change what trade-offs we’re willing to make.

On Tuesday, Stanford School of Medicine’s John Ioannidis (who is, I assume, under shelter-in-place restrictions, too) argued that since we know so little, we should hesitate with such drastic restrictions. I disagree. With this order, we have bought ourselves three weeks. In three weeks, we’ll know more. Some of these terrifying uncertainties will have resolved themselves into information we can use to keep our communities safe. And we’ll have manufactured more medical devices and protective equipment that can keep sick people alive and doctors and nurses safe.

We might be able to stop the virus in its tracks, for now, and give our world time to figure out its next steps.

I can’t pretend that it’s comfortable or secure or reassuring here in the Bay in this moment — but I hope the rest of the country is ready to follow us.

But nowadays, if you looked at my iPhone, you’d find cat photos interspersed with photos of empty toilet paper aisles at stores like Target, Safeway, and Fred Meyer. As a shopper for both Instacart and Shipt, companies that provide grocery and delivery services, I sometimes send customers proof that there really is a shortage in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. I want customers to feel reassured I’m doing my job.

My work — where I make between $7 and $10 per order before tips — often leaves me feeling a mixed bag of frustration, guilt, and purpose. Most of my customers are grateful for the service, and I feel useful, almost cheerful, when I drop something off at their house (lately, I’m doing more dropping off than handing off items at the door). Stores are busy but not as swamped as they were just a few days ago, and I try to avoid getting too close to people. Social distancing in a crowded soup aisle isn’t ideal, but that combined with constant handwashing and cart-disinfecting seem like my best options for now. It’s only later, when I’m back in my car looking for another order, that I wonder if the best thing I can do instead of working is spending more time self-isolating with my cats.

But here’s the problem: I cannot shop for other people’s groceries from inside my apartment. I cannot make money by staying isolated. I am a freelancer who can’t afford the purest form of social distancing.

A year ago, I was one of the people who could work from home. I got most of my income from sitting at my laptop, ghostwriting articles. But then I started to struggle with feeling burnt out and cooped up. That made me less motivated to seek out additional writing gigs, which meant I made less money, creating a cycle that made me feel more disposable than I already did.

I signed up for Instacart in mid-February, right before it stopped being acceptable to say, “I wanted a job that gets me out of the house.” Shipt came a little later. Shopping and delivering is my main source of my income now, though that could change. As someone who is always revising my plan B, the only constant is my lack of employee-sponsored health insurance.

The coronavirus pandemic has exposed that there are millions of people in America like me: people who don’t have a traditional 40-hour-a-week job, which means we also don’t have benefits or sick leave — which also means we don’t have many choices when a pandemic arises and the bills keep coming in. While I may be in relatively good health now, I’m also gambling that my immune system is more stable than my job situation.

Every day, it seems like more closures of buildings are ordered, more coronavirus cases are being reported, and infectious disease experts are warning us we need to do more to keep our distance. That is when the guilt starts to creep in and I feel pulled between making ends meet and questioning if I’m doing my best for my community.

I know that imposter syndrome during a pandemic is the most self-indulgent kind, but in those low moments, I wonder what special skills I have that I can go out when other people are hunkered down? How am I essential? A friend of mine has a husband who works at a gas station while she stays home with their infant. He cannot oversee the gas pumps from home. If he doesn’t go to work, then they don’t have a home, and you can’t shelter in place without a roof over your head. Another friend’s husband works for the US Postal Service as a mail carrier. Telecommuting isn’t an option there, either.

Maybe my friends are right, that I am helping people self-isolate by delivering groceries to them. One woman told me, “I hate Instacart,” which alarmed me until she added, “because it’s got me spoiled.” The adult kids who are ordering for their parents remind me that I could soon be doing the same thing for my own parents, both of whom just turned 60 last year.

In normal times, I have trouble with vulnerability, with the idea that people will always need help from others. I’m trying to find comfort in that idea now. We need gas and mail and prescriptions and healthy foods to cook at home. Sometimes we also need a king-size Kit Kat or tub of Pringles to get us through the lead segment on the news.

For the moment, I can bring people food and other supplies. I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that tomorrow or next week. Like everyone else, I’m waiting and seeing what happens next. I just happen to be doing it while driving around in a Chevy Malibu filled with insulated cooler bags and disinfectant wipes.

"['Julia Belluz', 'Mar']",2020-03-18,What it’s like to have a baby during the coronavirus pandemic,"Editor’s note, March 18: The author, who submitted this story on Monday, delivered a healthy baby boy in Vienna on Tuesday.

VIENNA — I’m nearly 40 weeks pregnant and being induced tonight, Monday, five days ahead of my due date. It’s not for medical reasons, but because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Like most women, I hoped to avoid any unnecessary interventions associated with childbirth. Then today, my doctor recommended an induction as soon as possible as the safest course. “Things are changing by the half-hour,” he said.

Normally, my husband and I would want to pause — read the research, weigh the risks and benefits, and maybe get a second opinion before making such a major health choice. But with cases doubling in Austria every two and a half days — one of the fastest rates in the European Union — the probability of an outbreak in our hospital increases, as does the chances that it’ll have to shut down. (Another Vienna maternity ward already has.)

With every passing day, there’s also a greater risk my husband or I get the virus, or someone in my family or network tests positive; with that comes higher odds we’ll have to be quarantined in labor and potentially separated from the baby at birth. And we already know getting full postpartum and pediatric care will be challenging in the months ahead: Some doctors are already opting to meet patients online, and midwives are being told not to enter people’s homes right now.

So we’re betting that delivering sooner is the safest choice — at least the hospital system isn’t yet overwhelmed.

I don’t know if this is the right decision. I am not sure of anything right now. I’ve covered health for more than a decade — long enough to know that viruses have peculiar ways of catching people and societies off guard. This one, however, has been even more of a Rubik’s cube than the others. Despite devoting much of my time in the past few months to talking to scientists, epidemiologists, and front-line health workers, trying to anticipate the curves of this pandemic and uncover patterns, I’ve had little success.

What I do know: Our baby will be part of a group of kids whose first days outside the womb collide with a fast-spreading, deadly scourge — like the kids born during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic a century ago. We’ll be talking about, and studying, this pandemic and its life-altering effects for decades. I also know my husband and I are privileged to live in a country with universal health care and a functioning health system. While I haven’t fully processed what’s happening — it’s unfolding too fast — this would certainly be more frightening in a place where people have to wonder how they’ll access or pay for their health care in a crisis.

Over the past 72 hours, life in Vienna, where I’ve been living since August, has changed dramatically. People are being asked to stay home for all but essential work and to buy basic necessities, such as food or medicines. We’re only to have contact with others in our household. Police can fine people up to 3,600 euros for violating the new rules.

The government has also mobilized the army to support the police and the health care sector in this period of enforced social distancing.

So there are few people or cars in the streets, and few kids outside (schools and playgrounds are closed). Restaurants, which were already under curfew as of Friday, shut down Tuesday. Pharmacies are asking people to line up outside and use hand sanitizer upon entering.

Watching public life grind to a standstill is strange in a moment when I’ve never felt more full of life.

Related Coronavirus is exposing all of the weaknesses in the US health system

This has meant we don’t know when we’ll see our families again, when they’ll meet our child: We’d be fined for meeting with my father-in-law in Vienna. My parents, who live in Canada, are currently barred from entering the EU due to coronavirus travel restrictions. Again, all this wasn’t true a week ago.

The support system we’d set up for after the birth has also fallen apart because of the new pandemic rules, which change by the day. On our way to the hospital, our midwife told us to pack extra clothes: There’s no going in and out right now — and no visitors allowed. Once we enter tonight, we can’t leave.

When we first heard about the lockdown on Friday, we dashed out to buy a crib. On Sunday, we ordered the last of the baby’s necessities online, hoping they’ll arrive in time. I also threw in a few stuffed animals; they looked comforting at a time when everything feels very uncertain.

A distant threat closing in

When I first learned about the outbreak, it was New Year’s Day. I was on holiday, reading about a mysterious, viral pneumonia spreading in China. I started to report on Covid-19 shortly after that, and for a while, the outbreak seemed a distant threat — a crisis Asia had to grapple with.

In those early days, the virus that causes Covid-19 didn’t have a name (now, it’s SARS-CoV-2), and it wasn’t yet clear that it could spread person to person. China emphasized that cases had been linked to a food market there, suggesting only those who had contact with infected animals were getting sick. The infectious disease experts I spoke to early on also tried to tamp down worry, saying that the risk of contracting Covid-19 was concentrated in China and travel outside the hot zone was completely acceptable. Perhaps they too couldn’t imagine how disruptive Covid-19 would become.

Within a month of China’s reporting, the outbreak had managed to spread to more than 100 countries and infect at least 174,000 people. For me, a turning point was the cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan in February. By the end of a distressing public health experiment, in which Japanese officials forced passengers to stay on board to minimize spread on the mainland, more than 700 people were infected and eight had died. If we didn’t already know it, this showed just how effective the virus was at spreading fast and killing some.

Yet, even then, the threat continued to feel distant, and that’s despite the years of warnings that a respiratory virus might emerge exactly as this one did, and travel around the world, taking lives in its path. I also couldn’t imagine Austria going the way of China in its response — shutting down the country with enforced social distancing.

That changed when Italy’s crisis began to unfold. We live 250 miles from the Italian border, where a national coronavirus emergency has been playing out for several weeks. The country was the first Western democracy to see the virus spread on an alarming scale — and the first to impose mass quarantines and travel restrictions. It’s a desperate attempt to slow the movement of a pathogen that had spread for weeks, unbeknownst to health officials, eventually crippling the country’s health system in the north and forcing doctors to ration care.

The more I read about Italy and talked to people there, the more I thought that what’s happened in Italy could happen anywhere. The region at the center of the crisis, Lombardy, is one of the wealthiest in Europe, with a robust public health system and no shortage of doctors. It seems the Italians were simply caught off guard by Covid-19 spread within their borders.

Our complacency likely stemmed from the fact we’d been “lucky” so many times: The viruses that have reached epidemic or pandemic levels and caused pain and suffering en masse in recent years haven’t been as effective as Covid-19 in transmitting worldwide. Their destruction was relatively circumscribed.

Zika, which dispersed wildly through South America and tormented mothers with the birth defects it can cause, required mosquitoes to transmit and eventually fizzled out. Ebola, which killed thousands in West Africa, needs close contact to spread — it doesn’t have the deftness of a respiratory disease like Covid-19, which can move with a mere cough or sneeze. Pretty early on in the swine flu pandemic of 2009, it became clear the virus wasn’t very deadly; it now circulates in the mix of seasonal flu pathogens.

Covid-19 is something entirely different. We still don’t know exactly how deadly it is or the range of symptoms it causes, but we know it’s much more severe than seasonal flu (which has a death rate of 0.1 percent), for example.

The case fatality rate for Covid-19 is estimated around 1 percent at the moment, and about 5 to 10 percent of confirmed cases need intensive care to stay alive. Some 80 percent of cases are milder, and scientists are still trying to determine the risk for children and babies. While the worst outcomes seem to disproportionately affect older adults and those with chronic illnesses, there are rare cases of young, otherwise healthy adults dying from the disease. No one fully understands why.

One guess is that death from this coronavirus is often preceded by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), just like the 1918 flu and SARS. Anything that severely damages the lungs can cause ARDS — from smoke inhalation to a car accident or drowning. When viruses cause it, though, they send the immune system into overdrive — but instead of attacking the foreign invader, the immune system manages a “virtual scorching of lung tissue,” as John M. Barry so vividly writes in his history of Spanish flu, The Great Influenza.

There is also no way to stop this process once it sets in, he continues: “The only care is supportive, keeping the victim alive until he or she can recover.” This is why intensive care units — the ones that are overrun now in Italy — are so important right now. Without them, among the most serious cases in the ICU, “the mortality rate would approach 100 percent,” Barry writes, as oxygen in a patient’s body depletes and the organs begin to fail or breathing becomes too challenging.

A disease’s severity — its death and attack rates — differs wildly by country and place. Averages can hide variation. What happens in one city or country may not happen in another. Ditto for what works to control a virus. It will likely take years to fully understand this disease and many months to develop a drug or vaccine against it. But even with the health uncertainties, Covid-19’s effects on social life and the economy are clear: It’s capable of mass destruction.

Life after Covid-19

As borders close around the world, and more and more countries implement social distancing measures, there has also been unprecedented cooperation in the scientific field. Journals are sharing information via open access; scientific teams that weren’t otherwise affiliated are joining forces to accelerate our understanding of this coronavirus. This is happening at a level we’ve never seen before.

Maybe the Covid-19 pandemic will make this collaboration the new normal. And maybe countries will see you can’t only invest in research and preparedness for pandemics when they’re already happening, then abandon the effort in between. It’s a cycle that in the US long predates President Trump, even if the administration’s reaction has been particularly weak and marred by outright lies.

I’m wondering what kind of world my baby will grow up in: One where pandemics, climate devastation, and financial crises that seemed far-fetched only weeks ago will be the norm, or one where the intelligence and good in society — the spirit of cooperation — will prevail, and we finally start preparing long before new, catastrophic threats emerge. In the latter version, people work together on evidence-based measures to deal with these predictable risks of globalization. I’m hoping desperately for that reality.

Maybe it’s already happening. On Friday evening, a neighbor who lives alone called to ask that we don’t forget her in the coming days and to offer help with anything we need for the baby. In the past few days, we’ve never talked more to friends and family. Among all the surprises of the pandemic, this closeness and neighborliness — at a time we’re supposed to be isolated from each other — is the feeling I’ll bring to the maternity ward tonight.

"['Jennifer Peepas', 'Mar']",2020-03-18,“Do this for me”: How to convince older loved ones to socially distance,"The group text came in from a concerned and well-meaning relative on Friday morning: a list of tips for keeping yourself safe from the coronavirus purporting to be “from Stanford,” (Stanford has since responded to the widespread email, saying the information is inaccurate and not from them) including self-testing for breathing difficulties by holding your breath (debunked), and sipping water every 15 minutes (sorry, no).

As we face down a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, I’m not the only one anxiously receiving and sharing information online, so I can’t fault the instinct to grab onto something that seems helpful and relevant. But judging by the hordes of people lining up outside bars Saturday to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day and the friends tearing their hair out over trying to keep their parents inside and alive, good information about things we can do to halt the spread of this illness is desperately needed.

Good morning, today I had an argument with my 71-year-old mother about whether she needs to go into town to buy BIRDSEED today, how are you doing with your loved ones — Sarah Marshall (@Remember_Sarah) March 15, 2020

Younger adults and their boomer parents are dealing with some serious role reversal right now, as we beg the same people who begged us not to do drugs or play in traffic to keep themselves home and stop getting their health news from conservative talk radio. As Anne Helen Peterson reported for BuzzFeed last week, many older people are resisting “social distancing” recommendations despite widespread knowledge that people over age 65 and people with chronic illnesses are at the highest risk of dying if they catch the virus.

The reasons for the resistance? Peterson cites three main obstacles: “misinformation, disidentification, and general stubbornness.” Between confusing and inconsistent government directives and media reports; politicians, pastors, and business owners who waited until the last possible moment to close and cancel things; and the ever-churning Facebook hoax generator, inaccurate information is feeding every impulse to just deal with it later and hope for the best. As for disidentification, many boomers don’t see themselves as “old people,” or “possibly sick people,” especially active, reasonably healthy ones.

So how can we make sure we’re sharing only the good stuff, especially when the available information changes every day, especially when even national authorities are sharing extremely mixed messages?

And how can we talk to our relatives, especially older, not-extremely-online relatives, and make sure the message is getting through? Here are some tips to get them informed and inside.

First, get your own facts straight

We’re all susceptible to things that seem plausible or give us reasons for optimism or a sense of control when we feel helpless. But before we share links, infographics, or other “viral” media, we need to double-check some things first. The “from a Stanford doctor” list my relative sent had some telltale problems on sight. Most notably, it was missing an author, any website links, or any citations of actual medical or scientific resources, and it didn’t match anything that was reported on legitimate news or public health sites. Having the right facts could literally save lives, and spreading the wrong ones, even inadvertently, could prevent your elderly relatives from taking you seriously about important things in the future.

Some information sources I’ve personally found informative and persuasive: the actual Stanford Health Care website, updated frequently, and Vox’s comprehensive explainer “A coronavirus reading guide for the perplexed, the anxious, and the obsessive,” which contains links to vetted information sources including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

This interactive graphic from the Washington Post’s Harry Stevens is as informative as it is hypnotic. In his post “Social Distancing: This Is Not a Snow Day,” Asaf Bitton, MD, MPH, the executive director of Ariadne Labs in Boston, answers questions like, “Is it okay to have playdates and sleepovers for bored kids”? (No).

For those whose relatives say, “Stop worrying, it’s just like the flu!” as they take in yet another zumba class? Here’s Charles Ornstein in ProPublica: This coronavirus is unlike anything in our lifetime, and we have to stop comparing it to the flu. Here’s Vox’s Brian Resnick: Covid-19 is not the flu. It’s worse.

Dianna E. Anderson, a writer in Minneapolis who tweeted that her 68-year-old father refused to stay away from a buffet restaurant this weekend, says she was able to have a follow-up conversation with him about the realities of the pandemic and the fact that he’s in a high-risk group. “It’s sunk in, finally,” Anderson said. How did she reach him? Anderson says, “I think it was South Dakota electing to close all K-12 schools for a week. That’s never happened before, and as he said on the phone, he’d never experienced anything like this in his lifetime (that he could remember).” When her dad kept insisting, “Well, it’s just like a really bad flu,” Anderson says, “I was emphatic in saying that no, this is worse ... and said directly, [more] people your age who get it will die from it.’ That seemed to reach him, too.”

If data isn’t breaking through, Peterson suggests showing rather than telling. “Show what’s happening in Italy and how the hospitals are overwhelmed, despite full quarantine measures. Explain that if the same thing happens here, they’ll need to be prepared: with meds, with food, with supplies.”

Second, speak in terms of actions, not just facts

As tempting as it is to drown everyone we know in all the facts and hope that will automatically lead to good decisions, people don’t work like that. As a species, we’re not …actually good? … at extrapolating from information and translating it into healthy actions.

Instead, tell people a series of actions they should and can be doing to protect themselves and others. If you’re speaking with your parents, grandparents, or other relatives, what is it that you want them to do? First is for them to stop touching their faces, wash their hands for 20 seconds frequently, and stock up on medications and food for at least 30 days. Find out if they need help stocking up, for example, if you can go to the store for them, or set up online grocery ordering if you don’t live nearby.

Then we get to the more difficult one: telling them to socially distance. Your folks need to stay home, cancel, or stop attending social gatherings, and avoid unnecessary errands and contact with people. This requires a giant adjustment in attitude, so maybe focus your energy there.

During my unofficial survey of friends and social media contacts who are trying to get their parents to take this seriously and stay the eff home, an extremely common thing is parents who insist that they are socially distancing and taking thing seriously but also making time for book club, fitness classes, volunteer work, and their friend’s birthday brunches (“But we’re being safe, we didn’t hug!”).

It’s time to ask your folks what they’re up to like you’re trying to suss out if they are smoking weed after school or if there will be any parents home at the sleepover. Ask what “Just a few errands” means. Ask them what “But we’re being safe!” means.

Maybe start the whole conversation by asking them what they are doing to keep themselves safe, ask them what they know, what they’ve heard, and what they need from you. “[Relative], I saw that they canceled schools and events near you. Are you all stocked up on what you need, and are you good to stay inside for a few weeks?” can get you started.

Third, if “please don’t!” is getting you nowhere, tell them what you’re personally doing and why

Nobody likes sentences that start with “You should …” or “What you really need to do is ...” If facts and directives aren’t getting through, try sharing what you are doing as a way to remove the imperative.

”I’m canceling everything and keeping my asthmatic self home for the foreseeable future.”

”I’m not letting the kids have any playdates and sorry, we won’t be having any visits with grandma right now. Can we set up Skype story time though?”

”I’m happy to pick up what you need at the store, but I’m not coming in — text me your list and I’ll leave it on the porch.”

The why is important, too, and may be an opportunity to get more facts out there and appeal to your folks’ sense of altruism:

”You can be asymptomatic but still spread it to other people, so I’m erring on the safe side.”

”Without widespread testing, we can’t know, so I’m taking what precautions I can.”

”I would feel terrible if [high-risk person you both know and care about] got it from me, so I’m going to keep my distance.”

Maybe your relatives won’t be persuaded by altruism or facts. Would they consider it as a favor to you?

”I’m trying not to panic, and it would help my peace of mind a lot if you would stay home for now. Do this for me.”

”I’ve had to stop myself from going places and touching my face about 10,000 times, I know it’s a giant pain, and the exact opposite of all the ‘get out there!’ ‘keep busy!’ advice for older people, but I don’t want to lose you. Please take this seriously and take precautions. For me.”

Anderson also emphasized the influential role that trust and peer networks have. “A lot of people won’t start taking it seriously until they see people in their own age group or in groups they respect taking it seriously,” she said. “I also suspect my brother and sister-in-law postponing my niece’s birthday party had an effect, too, which means social consequences might be really a good way to go here.”

Charlotte H., a 34-year-old grad student in Springfield, Missouri, agrees. “[My mom] believes in being in church no matter what. Maybe if her pastor closed the church she’d take things seriously; I know she listens to and respects her pastor a lot.”

Institutions and official directives like school closings, event cancellations, and business closings do carry a lot of weight, but don’t also forget the ways that your older relatives have power and influence with each other and their community. The pastors, business owners, senior managers, and public servants in our lives need to hear from us that staying home and using their positions of responsibility to get others to do the same is the right thing to do. And if your mom won’t stay home from church? Maybe her pastor needs a reminder they can use wifi for a while and send them a link to a Zoom tutorial.

Fourth, do what you can to help people surmount tech and other barriers

Is it that your folks don’t want to comply with social distancing and quarantine protocols, or is there some reason they can’t? During the “What do you need and how can I help you get what you need?” conversation, take note of fears, concerns, accessibility needs, and tech barriers.

The people who still write paper checks in the grocery store or valiantly keep print media alive so they can clip out articles on the dangers of vaping to send you are not necessarily going to latch onto telemedicine or online shopping for groceries. Offer to help them set up accounts and be their on-call troubleshooter. Offer to conference call the doctor’s office on their behalf and get the info together about telemedicine appointments and prescription meds.

Google available services for older people in their neighborhoods, see what local mutual aid options are springing up to respond to the crisis (tons of volunteers are offering to safely run errands for housebound people for as long as they can on an ad hoc basis). See if local grocery stores are offering a dedicated shopping time for older people.

For those of you who have steadily enforced “I’m not your tech support, Aunt Bea” boundaries for the last decade, I both apologize and salute you. But now is the time to step in.

Finally, hold the line with the one person you can control (you)

Our relatives and fellow citizens may not be persuadable and they may not be persuadable specifically by us. If your relatives insist on going out dancing and hugging the whole town, you may not be able to personally stop them, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep yourself and your immediate household as safe as you possibly can.

This might mean that it’s too risky to spend time with family members for the foreseeable future, and that hurts. I texted the relative who sent me the list of debunked tips to say that I loved them and needed them to stay safe and alive, since asthma prevents me from flying home for any funerals. It’s not snark. I’m a high-risk, immunosuppressed human who is going absolutely nowhere for the next month and who greatly appreciates the efforts of everyone reading this to do what they can to slow this thing down and give science a chance.

"['Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-18,What it’s like to work in a nursing home during a pandemic,"As the Covid-19 pandemic sweeps through the nation, thousands of nursing homes are locking down.

Following an outbreak at a Kirkland, Washington, nursing home associated with the deaths of 25 people, retirement and care homes have been on high alert, especially since coronavirus mortality rates for the elderly are relatively high. Many are shutting their doors to outside visitors, limiting personnel, and canceling nearly all social gatherings. For nursing home residents who already struggle with loneliness, the complete ban on visits from loved ones, Saturday afternoon bingo, and religious services is a massive blow.

These bans are obviously upsetting, but know that these decisions are not being made lightly. I’m a chaplain intern at a nursing home, and while we haven’t been hit with coronavirus yet, we are preparing for the worst. And that means keeping our elderly residents healthy beyond their physical well-being. Right now, a rotation of silly jokes, as well as hand sanitizer, have become an integral part of my spiritual praxis.

Technically speaking, many nursing homes are well-equipped to handle a deadly virus. With more than 90 percent of the deaths associated with your standard seasonal flu occurring among the elderly, there are rigorous response protocols in place to contain the spread of disease. Flu shots are mandatory for all staff, there are hand sanitizer stations around every corner, and staff and volunteers with symptoms of the flu are asked to stay home. If the flu finds its way in, the infected resident and those with whom the patient has been in recent contact are isolated. After so many years of flu protocol, nursing staffs are practiced in containment.

But with the emergence of the novel coronavirus, restrictions are tightening. At the facility where I work, all staff, visitors, and volunteers are being scanned at the entrance for fevers and asked not to enter if they have symptoms such as coughing or trouble breathing, or if they (or anyone they cohabitate with) have traveled out of the country in the past two weeks. Communal worship gatherings have been canceled until further notice, and chaplains are instructed to broadcast Sunday services on closed-circuit television, available to each resident in their room. Visits from school children and other volunteer groups have been indefinitely postponed.

Social distancing is crucial at this time, but it also exacerbates a known crisis faced by all nursing homes: loneliness. It is sadly very common for patients and residents in care facilities to feel abandoned by their living relatives who, unable to provide the round-the-clock care they require, put them in homes. And it is also not unusual for residents in their 90s and beyond to have actually outlived all of their friends and relatives, including, in many instances, their own children.

Compounding this loneliness is the likelihood that spouses and children of patients won’t be allowed to visit their loved ones in the weeks to come. We’ve all seen photos on the news of people knocking on nursing home windows, trying to see their elderly family members through the glass barrier. Even within homes that offer different levels of geriatric care, spouses who regularly see their partners may not be able to visit for weeks, perhaps even months. Anyone with a heart knows how much it hurts to be kept apart from those you care about during a crisis. These will be trying times for thousands of seniors and their families.

These restrictions will also affect volunteers. Even before the pandemic, many assisted-living facilities throughout the country were suffering from a lack of those rare, kind-hearted souls who stop by for a friendly game of cards or to accompany wheelchair-bound residents on a walk outside. With the pandemic in full swing, such volunteers — many of whom are elderly themselves — are being asked to stay home.

Soon, other opportunities to gather, such as chair yoga and afternoon bingo, will also likely be canceled. During these difficult and scary times, healthcare chaplains play a critical role, providing ongoing prayer, succor, and, most importantly, friendly companionship. Chaplains like me are considered by most facilities essential personnel and will likely continue to do our work even if the home is put in lockdown. Staff will also pull double-duty, ensuring residents’ physical health and safety as well as comforting their spirits.

For those concerned about relatives living in a care facility, don’t be afraid to reach out and check in. FaceTime and Skype are great options if patients are already set up, but know that the phone is likely the best way to get in touch and still the most cherished form of communication for many elderly residents. Busy staff will have very limited time during a pandemic to train residents on how to use computers and iPads. The most trusted communication channel remains the old-fashioned landline.

During the next few weeks and months, our health care system will be fully occupied with the critical mission of keeping our seniors alive. Nursing home staff have considerable practice in safeguarding the health of seniors during an outbreak. However, there’s plenty of work left ahead for the rest of us to ensure that our nation’s elderly and most vulnerable are never left feeling abandoned.

"['Alexandra Stockwell', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-13,What to do with your kids when schools are canceled,"On Thursday, the state of Ohio shut down its schools as a precautionary measure around the spread of Covid-19. Maryland, New Mexico, Michigan, and more soon followed, with more states to come, leaving millions of students home for the foreseeable future, and their parents and guardians scrambling to know what to do next.

From a public health standpoint, closing schools is a useful measure. From a parenting standpoint? It’s more likely to be incredibly stressful and logistically challenging.

But it doesn’t have to be. For the past 10 years, I’ve homeschooled my four children and understand how to survive several weeks at home with a houseful of kids — even if you have your own work to do.

Granted, getting through a school closure is not the same as choosing to homeschool your kid. But my experience, both as a doctor whose children attended a traditional school and now as a homeschooling mom running a growing business, means I am well aware of the underlying tensions of having children at home full time while also managing work responsibilities — not to mention the stress resulting from uncertainty about the future.

Here are five lessons I learned as a homeschooling parent that can make the time you spend with your children during school cancellations less stressful, more enjoyable, and maybe even educational.

Instead of trying to create “school at home,” readjust (and relish) the newfound freedom

Think of this time as an unanticipated staycation, where your family gets to spend time together and have some fun.

One amazing benefit of having children at home is that it eliminates the stress that comes with getting everyone out of the house each morning. Before I started homeschooling, we spent our mornings fighting about getting shoes on and not forgetting backpacks. Suddenly, mornings were peaceful, with children cozy on the couch in their pajamas for a few extra hours. (Your kids, like mine, may want to wear their PJs all day, and why not? Save yourself the power struggle.)

Start by having a family meeting. Let every family member talk about what they want to get out of this break. In my family, we do this for vacations and before we start a new school year. It creates buy-in from my kids and results in great ideas I wouldn’t have thought of. (In the past, my kids have wanted to play Apples to Apples, organize a chess tournament, and eat French toast.) If you’re not taking time off, use this meeting to establish that you’ll be working for part of the day, and that the kids need to make space for that.

Some children know exactly what they want to do during the time off. Other children are so used to having their days planned that it may take a while before they can answer the question, so let them know they can respond later.

Create a schedule for your day — but don’t put too much pressure on yourself to stick to it

When I first started homeschooling, I mapped out our days from 8 am until 4 pm by the quarter-hour. I figured that’s how it’s done in school, so that’s what we would do at home. But that level of detail applied to just a few kids at home (rather than hundreds in a school building) was too restrictive. We were all stressed out by it, transitions were a lot harder, and it kept me focused on the clock rather than on my family. After a lot of trial and error (including swinging the other way and having no schedule), I find the best schedule is one that is spacious and flexible, and builds in plenty of independent learning and play time for kids, and reliable break times for me. Here’s a sample:

Breakfast to 10 am: Play inside

10 am to noon: Group project

Art, cooking, jigsaw puzzle, work assigned by the school, multi-age learning kit

Depending on how self-sufficient the children are, this may be an opportunity to work part of the time, or it could be some designated face time with your kids so you can disappear behind your office door later in the day.

Noon to 12:30 pm: Lunch

12:30 to 2:30 pm: Alone time for everyone

Books, educational tablet time, coloring, crafts, infuriating Zoom call with Steve from accounting

2:30 to 4:30 pm: Outside play

Depending on the age of your kids, you can keep an eye on what’s happening but only get involved as needed

4:30 pm until dinner: Regroup time

TV, video games, books

Be responsive to your children’s ages

For K-5 kids, the transition to being at home is probably easiest. They may miss their friends and feel concerned about so many changes, but they will enjoy the novelty of the new routine.

Middle schoolers may resist being at home and away from friends. Your family meeting is an important opportunity for your middle schooler to brainstorm on how to stay connected with friends (the answer will probably be TikTok).

High schoolers are most likely to need to keep up with their schoolwork to complete the semester on time. Their schools should provide information on expected academic progress and what kind of support your kid will need to do it. So many high schoolers have such busy days that having a break in the pace may actually be welcome, and their independence means you should have more time on your own.

Having multiple children at different ages can be challenging. At one point, I was dealing with a toddler and children in third, eighth, and 10th grades, while also working 20 hours a week. I learned how to make the age range work to my advantage: Older children helped younger ones with their lessons, and the younger children prepared snacks for the family.

No matter the age, the whole day is much smoother for everyone when you connect deeply with each child at least once a day. Set up siblings with something that will occupy them so you can have uninterrupted one-on-one time.

Go off-book, especially if you need to get your own work done

Some schools may send home work or institute e-learning, but it’s unclear if that will fill all the hours of a traditional school day. Consider other ways to divert your curious kids’ attention that will be beneficial (and engaging) to them without you feeling like a substitute teacher.

In addition to some of the activities suggested above, take advantage of the many excellent online learning platforms, like outschool.com (which covers a wide range of topics), and brainpop.com (which focuses on the STEM fields: science, technology, engineering, and math). My kids especially liked the rancher who gave a lesson on horse husbandry and the beginner’s calligraphy class.

Use the time to train the kids on skills like cooking and laundry, and any other chores you can’t fit in during the busyness of the school year. While most children are no longer taking classes in home economics, such skills are still necessary — and can take chores off your plate.

When it’s time to work, make sure your kids know what to do in the meantime, preferably something they look forward to. I deliberately only let my kids play on my phone when I need to get work done.

Look on the bright side

Don’t forget: This is going to be a formative time for your child. What do you hope they’ll say when their grandkids ask them what they remember about the coronavirus outbreak of 2020? Make this time special. Do projects together such as filming a movie about your family or making cards for isolated elders in your area. Share stories about your childhood and teach them games you enjoyed as a kid.

In some families, the first days of being at home together may be the hardest. In others, the first days may be quite fun, but once the whole experience is no longer novel, it will become harder. Put in the time to figure out what works, because the return is more ease for everyone and more time to do your own projects (but try to make sure that some of those “projects” are things like a bath or a walk, and not just endless work).

Most of all, be compassionate — toward yourself and your children. We have never experienced anything like the current crisis, and all of us are pioneers.

"['Carlye Wisel', 'Mar']",2020-03-10,Money Talks: The family that’s been to Disney dozens of times,"Welcome to Money Talks, a series in which we interview people about their relationships with money, their relationships with each other, and how those relationships inform one another.

Walt Disney World is poised as a once-in-a-lifetime visit for most families, but for others, it’s home base. With new rides opening, seasonal food abounding, and hotels debuting constantly, there’s always a reason to return — and if you’re a fan, it can be a slippery slope toward becoming wholly obsessed.

Rocio de la O Peña, her wife Lenise Kryk, and their twin 3-year-old sons are wholly obsessed. Hooked on the utopian glee of a Disney vacation, the couple has spent the past few years eschewing a single blowout trip in favor of feeling that Happiest Place on Earth glow as often as possible. They go for the rides, entertainment, nighttime shows and attractions that are generally included with their admission, but there’s plenty of merchandise, seasonal food, and add-ons to splurge for as well.

“Going to Disney” isn’t always synonymous with the California and Florida theme parks. The company operates a cruise line, a Hawaiian resort, and even something called the Disney Vacation Club, a time-share program that offers part-ownership in Disney hotels and the possibility of visiting international resorts like Disneyland Paris and Tokyo.

Rocio and Lenise do all of this — and more. Based in Las Vegas, the family of four visited Walt Disney World and Disneyland, took a Disney Cruise, traveled to Disneyland Paris, and even joined Disney Vacation Club in the past two years, all without breaking the bank. Rocio, who works part-time for an autism treatment assistant program, and Lenise, the clinical director of an agency that provides in-home behavioral services for autistic children and teenagers, make it work on a combined low-six-figure income by way of setting their own rules, snapping up a deal when they see it, and eating a lot of cold-cut sandwiches.

With Disney vacations as the ultimate financial priority — and yet another international theme park, Tokyo Disneyland, on the horizon for 2021 — here’s how they make it work.

The following conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Rocio: Because we used to be Florida residents [until recently], we got our Florida Weekday Select annual passes in 2018. We were able to take both 2018 and 2019 Walt Disney World trips with those annual passes. It cost $690 for the both of us combined, and the boys were free. [Children under age 3 do not need to pay admission for Walt Disney World and Disneyland parks.]

Lenise: Their birthday is March 3rd, so we went mid-February to celebrate their 2nd birthday. The twins had a free flight there; not needing tickets for them has been a saver.

Rocio: The last two years we’ve been to Walt Disney World one time each year. We stayed with the same friends both times, on property because of their Disney Vacation Club, so we didn’t have to pay for a hotel.

Lenise: We’ve never done a Disney Dining Plan, [which allows you to pay for your meals in advance.] We eat 80 percent of our food that we bring with us, and it’s actually pretty doable for four of us. When we stayed at Old Key West — it was a huge two-bedroom apartment kind of deal — we went to the grocery store on the way up.

We typically buy food for breakfast if we stay somewhere on property — yogurt, some waffles for the kids — and then we pack sandwiches, fruit, and a lot of snacks. It’s kinda like when you go to the movie theatre, you just want to eat all day. When you walk by churros, pretzels, and cookies all day long, you gotta have a replacement. We’ve got a cooler that fits really nice with the stroller; we’ve got it all dialed out. It’s an extra bag and a cooler, that’s really all it ends up being. And then we buy one meal in the park.

Rocio: On the 2019 Walt Disney World trip, I was able to book all four of us for $510 on Frontier Airlines to Orlando International Airport

Lenise: Rocio is amazing, I don’t know how she finds the flight deals she finds. Sometimes we’ll fly into Ft. Lauderdale or Miami and then rent a car and make our way up the coast to Orlando.

Rocio: We don’t call them vacations, we call them trips. Vacation is when you relax.

Lenise: Traveling with children is a trip. I work with kids with autism — I’m a behavioral interventionist, so dealing with behaviors and shaping behaviors is what I do every day. It’s like a lifestyle; it’s not one of those things you can just turn on and turn off. They are, you know, not angels of course — they’re 3 — but I think we’ve been pretty consistent with rules and expectations, so I think that helps. Souvenirs can be very expensive — I’ll get Disney-branded Pez dispensers or random other Disney trinkets we find [at home] to put in the stroller and randomly give to [the kids] like, “Here’s a Disney treat!” They could care less if it’s from Disney World or not, and that definitely saves quite a bit of money.

Rocio: We don’t have passes to Disneyland or Disney World right now. We didn’t renew because we were going to go from two to four passes [because the kids got older]. We knew we wanted to do a Disney Cruise and visit Tokyo Disneyland in 2021, so we put that as a priority. We didn’t want to deal with the crowds of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opening, so we figured it was a good year to take a break.

Lenise: If anyone gets us a gift, it’s Disney gift cards. We save the Christmas ones and use those for the treat or toy [the kids] pick out that day. And Starbucks gift cards — I know it seems really silly, but when we’re driving to Disneyland or even at Walt Disney World, we save those to have our breakfast there.

If people give you cash, you’re going to spend it on stuff. If they give you Disney gift cards, there’s no option but to spend it at Disney. Target has Disney gift cards, and if you have a Target card or RedCard, you get 5 percent off. A friend has a RedCard, and when we have a bigger trip, [they’ll lend it to us to] buy Disney gift cards. It keeps us within our budget if I know how much is on that gift card. If I just use a credit card, I’ll forget how much I’m spending.

Rocio: We literally think about things so much.

Lenise: This is the only way that we can actually do it. I think our friends either think we’re just like multi-millionaires because we go to Disney so much, but the ones who come with us end up going, “Okay, I get it.” We know what we want and we’re willing to sacrifice certain things.

Rocio: We are very lucky to have friends that are willing to [let us visit with their rewards points]. We bought our California Disneyland annual passes the first year and then my wife’s awesome boss gave us annual passes the next year. So, we’re just very, very lucky, too. The two times we had our annual passes from 2017 to 2019, we went to Disneyland 50 times.

Lenise: We went Disneyland 10 times in 2019; over 20 days total.

Rocio: The rule for Disneyland is [to stay in] walking distance from the park and get free parking. That’s my priority when I’m looking at hotels. Usually I do HotelTonight or Hotels.com because they have the best deals. I never book in advance; I always book two nights before or the day of, because most of the time we have stayed walking distance to Disneyland for less than $100. If we can squeeze free breakfast, that’s amazing, but if not, we bring it.

Lenise: We max out our time in Disneyland for sure; we start early and we stay late. There’s a CVS right by there too, so it’s still cheaper to go get lunch meat and bread and stuff, but a lot of times, since we’re driving in, we just bring everything we need and make sure the place has a fridge. I’d rather go 30 times in the year and save money with sandwiches than just go one time.

Rocio: In Disneyland, I have to go to Ghiradelli once a trip to get the Nob Hob Chill shake with a shot of espresso ($10). Ghirardelli does not take Disney gift cards, so this treat always comes out of our spending money.

Lenise: The Disneyland corn dogs are definitely a splurge for me. I always like the apple pie caramel apple ($11.99). I can’t make those and carrying that would be a nightmare.

Rocio: We did the seven-night Very Merry Christmas Cruise in November 2019 on the Disney Fantasy. We booked it through Costco because when you book from them, you get 5 percent back if you use the Costco credit card and $250 Costco cash, so that definitely brings the cost down.

Lenise: The trip, before those rebates, was $5,200. I knew I wanted to do a Disney cruise for my 40th birthday, that was no question ... but we did it in November because we got three extra days and Christmas theming for almost the same price it would have cost us in April. We got our Santa pictures there, we got our family Christmas card pictures there, so all-in, not too bad.

Rocio: We had a goal for last year for our savings, and we knew that we were going to spend this money next year anyway, so we compromised and said okay, we’re going to take that from our savings now, but next year, we have to meet our goal.

Lenise: We joined Disney Vacation Club this past November while we were on a Disney cruise. We’ve gone and done the spiel probably three times; we know the benefits and we kick ourselves in the butt for not getting it earlier. Whenever we looked it up before, we were looking at a $500-a-month payment and I was like, “I can’t, that’s just too much, I’m gonna have a hard time sleeping at night for the next 10 years.” So, [for a smaller investment with fewer “points” that can be used to book rooms] we pay $250 a month and the down payment was $4,300.

Rocio: We do have to pay property taxes each year, but the fee was waived because Disney’s Riviera Resort, the property we bought into, wasn’t yet open at the time.

Rocio: We even brought our popcorn bucket [on the cruise] so we could get $1 popcorn refills. We tried to save.

Lenise: We actually borrowed it from our friends in Florida, took it there and gave it back to them.

Rocio: It’s the little things.

"['Lux Alptraum', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-10,I have OCD. Here’s how I’m dealing with coronavirus fears.,"Over the past few weeks, as the Covid-19 coronavirus has made its way around the world, I’ve found myself preoccupied with worry. Am I washing my hands enough? Am I touching my face? What am I touching on the subway? What if I get infected and don’t realize it, and unknowingly pass on the virus to older or immunocompromised loved ones? Maybe I should start wearing a surgical mask when I visit my parents. Maybe I should stop visiting my parents. Maybe I should stop leaving the house.

As someone who lives with OCD, I’m used to having my anxious thoughts take over — and, thanks to the work I’ve done in therapy, I’m usually pretty good at flagging thoughts as anxiety and OCD rather than a legitimate concern. But as the coronavirus outbreak has put the world on high alert, many of the thoughts I’d ordinarily dismiss as a product of my anxiety have started to seem like rational worry, and I find it harder to push back.

Although many people associate OCD with obsessive cleanliness — a habit that might seem helpful in the midst of an outbreak — the reality is much more complicated. For many people, OCD involves extreme hypochondria or intrusive thoughts about harm coming to oneself or loved ones. The stress of an outbreak can exacerbate those fears, leading to a resulting increase in compulsive behavior, like time-consuming rituals that disrupt one’s life, or extreme self-isolation.

It’s not just people who live with OCD. For anyone with generalized anxiety or other mental disorders that make one prone to excessive worrying and irrational behavior, outbreaks can be a particularly dangerous time. As we work to protect ourselves from pathogens, it’s easy to get caught up in panic — and that panic can threaten the tenuous control we maintain over our mental health.

So how can you avoid infection without spiraling out of control?

For starters, avoid the temptation to learn everything you possibly can about Covid-19. While more information might seem like the best defense against illness, it’s far more likely to ramp up your panic — especially if you’re getting that information from a place like Twitter, where the takes are fast, furious, and frequently unverified. On social media, “the information is coming so fast and so thick and so unverified that it’s very easy to get overwhelmed,” says bioethicist Kelly Hills. “If you don’t need to stay on top of this for your job or your academic work, don’t.”

Hills recommends limiting your Covid-19 news consumption to once a day, and only getting that news from a trusted, verified source. While staying informed is important, sensationalistic coverage is far more likely to inflame panic and cause more harm. “We have to regulate and make choices about what we are exposing ourselves to,” says therapist Jenn Brandel, noting that managing anxiety around outbreaks requires us to focus on facts rather than emotions. If it’s friends and family, rather than the news, who are inundating you with Covid-19 updates, it’s okay to mute them on social media, or ask them not to message you with anything related to the crisis.

Second, set a basic safety regimen — and avoid the temptation to add to it. As you’ve likely heard, regular hand-washing is one of the most essential components of coronavirus prevention, but washing your hands repeatedly, for far more than 20 seconds at a time, is moving out of disease prevention territory and into compulsion territory. Too much hand-washing can actually work against that effort.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

“If you are washing your hands so much that they are raw or chafed, you are washing your hands too much,” says Hills. Washing your hands, she points out, isn’t about preventing an infection from seeping in through your skin; it’s about removing pathogens before you pass them on to points of entry like your eyes, nose, and mouth. If your hand-washing leads your skin to crack and bleed, you’ve created a new entry point for the virus — meaning you could be more, not less, likely to get infected. (If you or a loved one are at elevated risk due to a comorbidity, Hills notes you can also wipe down light switches, phones, countertops, and other frequently touched surfaces with a Clorox wipe once a day — but once a day should be sufficient, and the entire process should only take a few minutes.)

If you’re worried that a self-quarantine might amp up your anxiety or depression, staying on top of your general fitness and wellness regimen is even more important during a stressful time like this one. Make sure you’re sleeping enough, eating a balanced diet, and getting some exercise. Even if you’re unable to leave the house, there are plenty of at-home workouts (everything from aerobics to Zumba) that you can use to get your heart racing from activity rather than anxiety.

And if you’re feeling really overwhelmed, remember that you don’t have to go through this alone. Therapy, Brandel says, can be an important part of managing your mental health during a crisis. If therapy isn’t an option for you, a trusted source — a doctor, a family, or a friend — who can help you analyze what is a rational concern or safety measure, and what is a panicked, anxious overreaction, is another excellent option.

And as social distancing becomes more widespread, with more of us finding ourselves having to work from home or stay in to care for children who can’t go to school, it’s good to plan some strategies to stay in touch with your support system remotely. Group chats and video chat can be a great way to feel connected to friends and family, but it’s also a good idea to check if your therapist is available to do sessions remotely over video chat or phone.

In my case, it’s been helpful to talk things through with friends and family, making a safety plan I can stick to that doesn’t go overboard. When I feel the urge to wash my hands, I stop and think about whether there’s actually a chance I’ve picked up new pathogens since I last scrubbed them, applying the same mindfulness techniques I’ve always applied to help manage my intrusive thoughts and compulsions.

Ultimately, the best way to get through these trying times is to just “keep doing your work,” says Brandel. “It’s easier to do our work around managing intrusive thoughts or managing compulsive impulses when we’re in the best of conditions. These aren’t the best conditions for someone with OCD [or other mental illnesses] — these are going to be hard conditions. But the work is still the same.”

Whether you’re struggling with OCD, generalized anxiety, or another mental illness that’s feeling more intensified in these trying times, you’ll be able to get through this outbreak the same way you get through everything: taking it day by day.

"['Jason Del Rey', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-30,Jeff Bezos warns that Amazon may lose money despite the pandemic shopping surge,"Amazon’s revenue grew 26 percent in the first three months of the year, the company announced Thursday. The tech giant became an essential shopping destination in March after the Covid-19 pandemic incited stay-at-home orders across the globe.

But CEO Jeff Bezos warned investors that the company’s profit would suffer over the next few months as it spent billions on safety measures for its workforce and other coronavirus-related measures.

“Under normal circumstances, in this coming Q2, we’d expect to make some $4 billion or more in operating profit,” Bezos wrote in a statement. “But these aren’t normal circumstances. Instead, we expect to spend the entirety of that $4 billion, and perhaps a bit more, on Covid-related expenses, getting products to customers, and keeping employees safe.”

Bezos said the new investments include paying for personal protective equipment for Amazon’s front-line warehouse workforce and extra cleaning in its facilities. The $4 billion figure also includes productivity losses from changes Amazon is making to its warehouses, including spreading workers out. Amazon is also working to develop its own Covid-19 testing lab and said it would start by testing some of its front-line workers. The testing initiative will cost Amazon around $300 million over the next three months, and, if successful, nearly $1 billion for the year, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.

Amazon registered $75.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter and a net profit of $2.5 billion.

The results reflect only part of the coronavirus’s impact to date, since the financial quarter only runs through the end of March and many stay-at-home orders did not begin until the middle of that month. But the numbers offer a snapshot of the pandemic’s impact on Amazon, which has been transformed from the leader in convenience shopping to an essential service for millions of US residents abiding by stay-at-home orders during the crisis.

Sales at Amazon’s physical retail stores — most notably its Whole Foods grocery chain — rose 8 percent in the first quarter amid a rush by shoppers to stock up on essential items during the crisis. These same brick-and-mortar sales only increased 1 percent in the same period of 2019. Amazon does not disclose specific sales numbers for Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh delivery services, which have seen unprecedented demand during the pandemic.

Amazon has also seen more engagement from its Prime members during the pandemic, Olsavsky told Wall Street analysts on Thursday. He said Prime members are shopping more often and increasing the size of orders. The number of first-time users of Prime’s video streaming service “nearly doubled” in the first quarter, he said. Recode reported earlier this month that Prime membership sales rose significantly since the crisis began.

In March, Amazon overhauled some of its long-held business practices to try to prioritize shipments of the most in-demand items. The company stopped accepting nonessential items at its warehouses for several weeks and pushed back delivery of some items as much as a month. Some Amazon merchants benefited from the changes while others suffered when Amazon hid their faster shipping speeds, in a move the company called at the time an “error.”

Amazon has also had to make drastic changes to its warehouse operations. The company said last week that it has spent nearly $700 million globally in extra wages for its hourly warehouse workforce and delivery contractors during the pandemic, both through increasing hourly pay by $2 and by doubling wages for overtime work. Amazon also hired an additional 175,000 warehouse workers since the pandemic began. Some of that expansion is designed to keep up with demand that at times has resembled holiday season volume; some new hires have been made to fill in the gaps for existing warehouse employees who have either called out sick or decided to take unpaid time off during the crisis.

Along the way, Amazon has also added safety precautions such as personal protective gear for warehouse associates, enhanced cleaning, and temperature checks at the start of each shift. But some warehouse workers, activist groups, and corporate employees have said the measures came too late or have not been adequate. Workers have participated in several small walkouts at facilities in the past month. Amazon has also fired several corporate employees and warehouse workers involved in organizing protests, though the company has said their employment was terminated for other reasons. The firings have sparked questions for CEO Jeff Bezos from politicians like Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), as well as outrage from some of Amazon’s own white-collar employees.

On Amazon’s earning call with reporters, a spokesperson declined to reveal neither the total number of warehouse employees who have tested positive for Covid-19 nor the number of Amazon warehouses that have confirmed cases of the virus.

"['Shirin Ghaffary', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,People are using Facebook more than ever during the coronavirus pandemic — but its business is still taking a hit,"As people around the world are shut in their homes under lockdown, they’re using Facebook more than ever to share news, message their friends, and find entertaining distractions from the dullness of quarantine life.

But that doesn’t mean Facebook, or other social media companies like Twitter and Snap, are making more money.

On Wednesday, in Facebook’s first earnings statement since the pandemic hit, the company shared impressive statistics: Nearly 3 billion people now use at least one of Facebook’s apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, or WhatsApp) each month, an 11 percent increase year over year and the highest it’s ever been. Facebook alone had 2.6 billion monthly active users, an increase of 10 percent year over year.

But financially, Facebook isn’t doing nearly so well.

While Facebook’s revenue was up overall by 18 percent year over year this past quarter, beating analysts’ expectations, much of that time period didn’t include the peak impact of the pandemic. Looking ahead, company executives said they’re bracing for a larger economic fallout. In the last few weeks of March, after global lockdowns began to take effect, the company said it saw a steep decline in the money it makes from advertising. These declines flattened out in April. Because of ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic, the company declined to give its usual prediction of how much revenue it will make next quarter, and instead offered the snapshot of revenue in the past few weeks of April instead.

“There is a lot of uncertainty now about the world,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said as he opened the quarterly earnings call. He admitted that the impact of Covid-19 on his business “has been significant.”

So why is Facebook expecting to make less money on advertising than before even as it gains more users? As my colleague Peter Kafka explained in March, as industries across the economy from tourism to real estate take a major financial hit, they’re in turn spending less to advertise on Facebook than they normally would. Many major brands have slashed marketing budgets for digital spending on platforms like Facebook. Facebook says advertisements coming from the auto and travel industry have been especially impacted, while other industries, like gaming, are relatively spending more.

This shift isn’t unique to Facebook. Twitter, Google, and virtually every other company whose main source of income comes from digital advertising are facing the same pressures.

“If you’re going to have a business which is primarily advertising, which is our plan for the long-term, you have to recognize that advertising is more volatile and sensitive to the macroeconomy,” said Zuckerberg on the earnings call.

Google’s parent company Alphabet announced on Tuesday that it has faced a significant downturn in advertisement revenues in March due to the pandemic, although not as bad as analysts expected. The search giant is reportedly planning to cut its marketing budget by half and slow down some hiring in order to tighten its belt.

But despite these short-term slowdowns for Facebook and Google, some argue that in the long run, the company, like the other major tech giants, could come out of this pandemic stronger. One of the biggest issues these companies previously faced pre-coronavirus was the threat of regulation. Now, the chorus of powerful voices calling to break up Big Tech has largely quieted, at least for now, as politicians face more imminent issues tied to the pandemic.

Another promising area for Facebook is in its gaming products and other hardware. It reported an 80 percent increase in its revenue from sources other than advertising, such as its Oculus Quest VR headsets and Portal video calling devices.

These advertising declines will also impact media companies that rely on Facebook and Google advertising for a large chunk of their revenue but don’t have the same enormous scale of business. Together, Facebook, Google, and Amazon make up an overwhelming majority of all US dollar spending on advertising.

Wednesday’s earnings from Facebook are another example of how widely popular Facebook is and how much people are using the tool during a global pandemic. They’re also a grim indication of how much the global economy is contracting. If these companies that make some of the most widely used tools in society are hurting, smaller companies will be especially hard hit in the face of a sustained global recession.

"['Shirin Ghaffary Jason Del Rey', 'Shirin Ghaffary', 'Jason Del Rey', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-29,Amazon is cracking down on internal communication after a surge in worker activism,"Amazon’s corporate employees have started to question the e-commerce giant’s business and labor practices more than ever before. In response, the company appears to be cracking down.

This week, Recode has learned that Amazon has started strictly enforcing rules that limit its employees’ internal communications with each other on several large company email listservs, where workers have been criticizing how the company is treating its warehouse workers during the coronavirus pandemic and have organized protests in response.

On Monday, Amazon’s IT department notified some employees who manage listservs of more than 500 people that they are required to have employee moderators pre-approve any posts on their mailing lists — a rule that the company says previously existed but several sources told Recode was rarely enforced until now. Employees who create or manage listservs can pick who they want to designate as the moderators, but those moderators have to be an “L6” manager-level employee or above, limiting the gatekeepers of the discussion.

A spokesperson for Amazon said that its policies about moderating large email lists are not new, but that after a routine audit, the company has started enforcing its policies for all mailing lists that either weren’t following the rules or had been previously granted exceptions.

Shortly after publication of this story, Amazon’s IT department notified Amazon employees who run large listservs that it is delaying making any changes to email moderation in order to “minimize disruption to any business-critical email lists,” per an email Recode reviewed.

Amazon’s listservs — which number in the thousands — are places for employees to discuss a wide range of topics, from climate change to parenting. Recently, some of these forums have also become places for workers to critique the company’s operational handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in how it treats warehouse workers, who have asked for higher pay and more safety protections. Some inside the company see the new communications rules as a way to muzzle corporate employees who are increasingly organizing on behalf of their lower-paid colleagues.

“It’s obviously and transparently being done to shut down employee communication,” said one corporate Amazon employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of company policies barring employees from speaking to the press without prior approval. “If we wanted to share information about a firing internally or publicize an event, we would need to convince a moderator to let us do it — and that would be mean them risking getting fired.”

Another corporate employee who’s active on internal listservs agreed that the move appeared to be aimed at the organizers, but that there were likely other factors at play, too. Recently, there’s been a rise in employees spamming these distribution lists with other kinds of requests, the employee said, and the organizers’ mass invites were likely the final straw rather than the only reason for the move.

Whether or not Amazon’s renewed enforcement of these rules is mainly meant to restrict internal activism, many Amazon employees perceive it that way. They worry that the company’s recent actions will be a barrier to having meaningful discussion on important topics like warehouse worker rights and the company’s environmental policies.

Amazon did not respond to a request for comment specifically about concerns that the rules are limiting employees’ speech on working conditions.

In recent weeks, hundreds of Amazon warehouse employees at more than 50 sites around the US have participated in protesting working conditions during the pandemic, demanding greater pay, access to protective gear, and more generous time-off policies. Amazon’s corporate employees have used listservs to share their dismay over the escalating labor disputes and to organize events that bring together blue-collar and white-collar workers.

Do you work at Amazon and have thoughts on corporate working conditions or policies? Please email Shirin Ghaffary at shirin.ghaffary@protonmail.com. You can also find her on Twitter at @shiringhaffary; Signal number available upon request.

In turn, the company has fired at least six employees involved in recent protests — including two longtime corporate employees, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa. Cunningham and Costa were prominent leaders of an internal climate activism group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ), with an active listserv of more than 8,000 members.

Last Friday, AECJ members used dozens of Amazon internal listservs to invite thousands of their colleagues to skip work in a mass sickout and instead attend a virtual panel discussion about Amazon warehouse working conditions and environmental policies. Although the invites to this event mysteriously disappeared from workers’ calendars and two organizers were fired for organizing a similar event the week prior, it went on as planned with more than 300 people attending virtually.

With the new enforcement about these rules on email communications, employees say it will be impossible for workers to use listservs to mobilize their colleagues in a similar fashion.

“Everyone seems to acknowledge (subtly or overtly) that this was in response to the employees getting fired and the sickout,” another Amazon employee told Recode. “I think part of what Amazon is trying to do is make average employees upset at AECJ because of this new inconvenience.”

Aside from the concerns about censorship of discussions about worker rights, several employees have also expressed concern in internal emails about how the rules will slow down forums dedicated to supporting underrepresented employee groups. Many of the most popular listservs at Amazon are ones for women in engineering and racial minorities who work at the company to virtually convene and support each other.

In an internal email one employee moderator sent to a listerv for discussing diversity and inclusion, the employee acknowledged that additional requirements will cause a “slower flow of communication” and that the moderation team may start rejecting certain emails, which will be “a very different dynamic” for the mailing list.

Last year, Amazon’s tech giant peer Google similarly limited employee speech on internal forums following a rise in worker activism. While the move was met with a fair share of criticism, the crackdown ultimately was not enough to stop workers from continuing to organize and publicly leak controversial company initiatives. In contrast to Google, the recent organizing on Amazon’s internal forums is relatively new to Amazon’s buttoned-up workplace culture, particularly on the corporate level.

If moderators of employee discussions find the policies too laborious, they could move the discussion to off-corporate platforms, as tens of thousands of Amazon warehouse workers have done in private Facebook groups. And while Amazon’s decision may stop contentious worker discussions in the short term, it also draws more attention to worker organizing and signals how seemingly threatened Amazon’s management is by open discussion among its employees.

"['Sara Morrison', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,The Apple-Google contact tracing tool gets a beta release and a new risk level feature,"The Apple-Google coronavirus exposure notification tool is one step closer to its planned mid-May release. On Wednesday, the companies announced that a beta version of the application programming interface (API) is being released to developers for the public health authorities who will be incorporating the tool into their digital contact tracing efforts.

As contact tracing becomes an increasingly hot topic in the Covid-19 pandemic, details of the new tool built by Apple and Google are coming into focus. In late April, the companies offered updates that included a closer look at how the tool will work on smartphones, information about additional privacy features, and a new name. Apparently, Apple and Google are backing away from the term “contact tracing.” Their tool is all about “exposure notification.”

As previously reported, the first phase of the rollout will be an API that will allow iOS and Android devices to exchange anonymized proximity keys using Bluetooth. Apple and Google have now revealed that the Bluetooth metadata from the devices will be encrypted, so it can’t be used to try to identify a device. Public health authorities will then be able to build their own contact tracing apps using this API, and they will set the exposure length, the amount of time the two devices need to be near each other in order to exchange keys. The maximum allowed exposure time will now be 30 minutes. Again, this will make it harder to link a rotating key to a specific user.

Additionally, app developers will be able to provide users with some general details about their exposure and their risk of catching the virus, based on their distance from and how long they were in proximity to an infected person. Public health authorities will be responsible for determining the parameters of those exposure risk levels on their respective apps. Apple and Google have not yet revealed which public health agencies they are working with, but the companies did say the API will only be available to them.

The public health authority apps in phase one will be opt-in, meaning users will have to download the apps and give them permission to access certain data. Once the app is installed, the user’s device will generate a daily key every 24 hours as well as keys that change every 10 to 20 minutes and broadcast from the device for contact tracing. These keys will also be randomly generated, Apple and Google have said, rather than derived.

As the companies already explained, the keys make it possible for someone who tests positive for Covid-19 to quickly alert their recent contacts. They just report their positive test results to the app, which will then inform everyone with whom they’ve recently exchanged keys that they were potentially exposed to the virus.

Apple and Google also revealed new details of the second phase of the tool’s rollout, which involves baking the contact tracing feature into the operating systems of iOS and Android devices. We already knew that this next iteration of the tool, which will be available in the coming months, will allow contact tracing features to run in the background of any device, whether it has a public health authority app installed or not. Now Apple and Google say that alerts about possible exposure will appear in the device’s notification center. There will also be a new interface that will allow the user to turn the Bluetooth beaconing on or off.

In order to prevent abuse and encourage use, Google and Apple have repeatedly said they designed the tool with privacy, transparency, and user control in mind. The tool was already mostly earning praise from privacy advocates for these measures — with a few exceptions — and these updates seem to solve some of the remaining concerns. One of these concerns is related to public health authorities being able to add their own privacy-compromising elements to the apps they build using the Apple-Google API. Company representatives said on a media call that they’re still creating guidelines for public health authorities but that their apps would be subject to the same terms of service as every other app on their platforms, and that features such as location tracking would require user consent, just as is true for all other apps.

It does seem as though Apple and Google’s privacy-first mindset isn’t meshing with some of the countries they hope to serve. France has asked Apple to allow its contact tracing app to run in the background (as in, constantly broadcast and collect Bluetooth keys even if the app isn’t actively being used) while sending that data back to the French government. But the Apple-Google API will only allow this to happen for apps that keep that data on devices, for privacy reasons.

Contact tracing has emerged as part of many countries’ visions for how to safely scale back isolation and social distancing efforts. While traditional contact tracing involves employing people to talk to infected individuals and then trace down those they’ve been close to, digital contact tracing using devices like smartphones is seen as the most efficient way to track the spread of the virus. Different nations around the world have tried different methods to accomplish this, some more privacy-preserving than others. Apple and Google’s tool is widely seen as one of the better efforts here from a privacy perspective, and that’s an attractive selling point for an opt-in feature that works best when everyone is using it.

Oh, and about that terminology. Apple and Google have replaced the “contact tracing” label with “exposure notification.” The companies said they believe it better describes what the tool does, and that it’s only part of a public health authority’s contact tracing program. This seems a bit trivial, but it’s actually a good reminder that these apps and their deployment are run through public health authorities, and it’s up to those authorities to make sure positive test cases are properly vetted. Meanwhile, it’s essential that populations that may not have access to iOS and Android devices are included in their contact tracing programs. Apple and Google aren’t doing this alone.

Update, April 29, 1:00 pm: This article has been updated with news that a beta version of the API has been released.

"['Rani Molla', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,"Phone data shows Americans are moving around more, despite social distancing orders","More than a month since the first pandemic stay-at-home orders in the United States, people are getting antsy.

The median distance Americans travel each day began to tick up in the past couple of weeks, well before a handful of states have officially begun to reopen their businesses and public spaces and others started talking about reopening. The stay-at-home orders meant to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus brought many economies grinding to a halt, and these reopening efforts represent an attempt to put people back to work. However, they could also cause a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as health experts warn that there’s not nearly enough testing to know whether or not it’s safe to reopen businesses.

These warnings haven’t stopped some people from increasingly leaving home in the past couple of weeks, potentially in defiance of those stay-at-home orders.

According to aggregated anonymized data from geospatial analytics company Orbital Insight, the median distance people traveled hit a low point on April 12, which was Easter Sunday, of about a half a mile. However, that distance nearly doubled to a mile the following Sunday, April 19. To come up with median distance, Orbital Insight used anonymized cellphone location data for 12 million devices, specifically creating a radius from the various locations people visit each day. The company reports its units of distance as degrees of latitude or longitude, which are displayed on the y-axis of the graph above.

That Easter Sunday low follows several weeks of declining median distance traveled, as cities and states across the country enacted shelter-in-place orders beginning in March. For context, in February, people typically traveled between about 2 and 3.5 miles each day (or .03 to 0.05 degrees of distance in latitude or longitude per day).

You can see the increase in the past couple of weeks on a county level in the map below. More yellow and orange on the map means a higher daily distance traveled and, therefore, presumably less social distancing. The image on the left side of the slider shows the week beginning April 10 while the map to the right shows the week of April 17.

Data from a second location-data tracking company, Unacast, follows a similar trend, with average mobility as well as proximity to others increasing after Easter. Unacast data also shows that foot traffic in retail stores is also starting to pick back up as stores in a number of states reopen.

Traveling farther or being nearer to people, of course, does not necessarily mean that people are violating social distance orders or going places they’re not supposed to go. In Florida and in more rural states, for example, where more people travel by car, it’s possible to more safely socially distance than in, say, parts of New York. But it does mean it’s less likely they are staying home.

The increased movement is also not happening in a vacuum. Death rates in many states began declining in mid-April, though social distancing likely contributed to those declines. Around the same time, governors started discussing plans to ease restrictions. President Trump, famously, hoped church pews could be packed by Easter.

The data also suggests the increase in movement began happening before official reopening dates, suggesting that the promise of reopening was enough to get people moving again. The relaxation is different for each locality, and some businesses were allowed to open before others. Tennessee and Georgia allowed many businesses to open April 27, for example, while South Carolina began incrementally opening public spaces a week before.

With the possibility of reopening seeming more real, it’s also possible people simply got restless or felt more comfortable venturing out after safely sheltering. The nicer spring weather certainly encouraged more than a few to get out of the house.

"['Theodore Schleifer', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,How Vote.org plunged into chaos just before the coronavirus hit,"How one of America’s most important voting rights groups plunged into chaos just before it was needed most

Share All sharing options for: How one of America’s most important voting rights groups plunged into chaos just before it was needed most

A voting rights group called Vote.org seems like precisely the type of nonprofit that should thrive in 2020, with fans from Barack Obama to Taylor Swift and a URL that can’t be beat.

Its efforts to expand vote-by-mail — during an election year when more Americans are likely to do exactly that than ever before — should only make it more essential.

But the organization, which has established itself as one of the country’s most important civic engagement groups thanks to its research on how to turn out voters with absentee ballots and for its work to help defeat Alabama’s Roy Moore in 2017, has been derailed in recent months by an ugly internal drama featuring several of Silicon Valley’s most powerful personalities.

Last summer, Vote.org’s board fired founder Debra Cleaver and replaced her with one of the board members that ousted her. That presaged a bitter months-long war between Cleaver’s donors and her former board, and in its aftermath, at least three of Vote.org’s potential partnerships crumbled, millions in expected contributions fell through, and a series of embarrassing missteps tarnished the nonprofit’s brand.

Recode’s interviews with more than two dozen people, including Vote.org’s major donors, partners, and former board members and employees, along with two legal complaints submitted to the California attorney general, paint a portrait of a nonprofit that has been arrested in development. And it couldn’t have come at a worse time: Now that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to stress test the American election system — with voters waiting in five-hour lines in Wisconsin during the pandemic this month, for instance — the work of organizations like Vote.org, which says it “plans to turn out more than 5 million low-propensity voters” in 2020, is more important than ever.

“If Vote.org were a public company, the shareholders would have voted the board out — and it wouldn’t have been close,” said Adam Goldstein, a past Vote.org donor who canceled a $1 million pledge to the group that had been in his will.

“If Vote.org were a public company, the shareholders would have voted the board out — and it wouldn’t have been close”

As you’d expect with an acrimonious split, both sides in the fight are pointing fingers. Defenders of the board told Recode that the fallout is Cleaver’s fault and that she poisoned the well with donors, caused havoc by refusing to leave her post quietly, and trash-talked the group to its partners so they cut ties.

Vote.org declined to comment on any specific reporting that Recode presented. Instead, it pointed Recode to data, such as that it had registered 550,000 new voters in 2020 and had helped about 500,000 voters request an absentee ballot. It also noted that it had created a website with resources on how to vote during the pandemic.

But no matter who is to blame, the mess has been crippling Vote.org and its ability to execute its mission. No one interviewed for this story, even those close to the board, thinks the nonprofit has fully recovered from the chaos. And experts worry that the saga could stifle efforts to make voting easier for people during an unprecedented election and pandemic. For all the rancor that has divided Cleaver and her former board, everyone on all sides could agree on this: A weaker Vote.org is bad for American elections.

“Startups and board drama are nothing new,” Sam Altman, the former head of Y Combinator, who has been among the Silicon Valley celebrities trying to outfox the board over the last year, told Recode. “But it’s a real shame when it sets back democracy.”

How democracy was set back

After Vote.org’s board voted to fire Cleaver last summer, the organization suffered what one donor called an “organizational shock” that negatively impacted its partnerships, its bank account, and its brand.

Cleaver had used her cult of personality to found a clearinghouse for absentee ballot information in 2008 that would become Vote.org. Her success depended on everyone from her former college classmates to fellow activists from her decade in the voting rights trenches. But if you live by a cult of personality, you die by a cult of personality — and when Cleaver left, many partners and donors did, too.

“Startups and board drama are nothing new. But it’s a real shame when it sets back democracy.”

“It’s a shame because what we’re seeing right now is total chaos. And these two vectors in American life — of the pandemic, and our really high liability that we can’t run elections — those two things are colliding in a way that no one is ready for,” Dan McSwain, a political operative and a former board member at Vote.org who left as Cleaver crafted an all-female board, told Recode. “It’s a shame that an organization with so much momentum behind it seems to have spent a year of its life wading through something that, as far as I can tell, seems self-inflicted.”

Vote.org’s first withdrawn partnership was one Cleaver had planned with MTV’s parent company ViacomCBS, which would’ve included billboards in Times Square advertising her group, along with hosting a new youth-focused voter registration push called +1 The Vote. Cleaver had a personal relationship with the head of Viacom’s election programming; immediately after her ouster, Viacom pulled out of the not-yet-finalized deal and instead struck a similar agreement with a Vote.org rival, TurboVote, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

And two other high-profile groups that Vote.org had worked with in recent cycles to turn out low-propensity voters, the Voter Participation Center and the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund, are no longer currently planning to sign up to work with Vote.org on voter-turnout projects after Cleaver’s departure, according to people familiar with the matter.

Board defenders downplayed these losses to Recode, saying that while they lost Cleaver’s network, other partnerships are now more possible without Cleaver, such as recently announced ones with the NAACP Youth and College Division and the Transformative Justice Coalition.

But the Voter Participation Center and the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund were historically among Vote.org’s most important partners and were key parts of its celebrated research program. Research accounted for about half of Vote.org’s total spending in 2017, the most recent year of available tax records. That year, the Voter Participation Center and Vote.org ran an experiment in Alabama to assess how text messages and mailers together could turn out black voters. The next year, in 2018, the League of Conservation Voters spent over $1 million through Vote.org to send 18 million texts to young voters and people of color.

While Vote.org still occupies a prized URL that registers already-likely voters who intentionally seek information about elections, critics say it no longer appears to be prioritizing the grunt work of researching and activating unlikely voters.

For instance, despite the nonprofit’s plans to use the 2020 primary season to test the effectiveness of various get-out-the-vote strategies, such as using texting to encourage voting-by-mail, Vote.org did not end up performing any research on ways to engage these low-propensity voters during the primaries this spring, according to people familiar with the matter. The group’s longtime research head, a college friend of Cleaver, stopped working with Vote.org after Cleaver’s firing. The group just didn’t have the money to do that expensive research, people close to it said.

That’s another way Vote.org suffered after Cleaver left: financially. Multiple political advisers to major Silicon Valley donors told Recode that Vote.org has suffered serious reputational damage and that they are recommending their clients give money elsewhere. Several of Vote.org’s former major supporters, including LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, venture capitalist Ron Conway, and Altman, are no longer advising their networks to support the organization, sources say. And in a letter in September that urged Vote.org’s board to reconsider Cleaver’s ouster, donors who claimed their donations and pledges accounted for 60 percent of the group’s funding warned that they would no longer back Vote.org if her firing wasn’t explained.

“Vote.org was the Silicon Valley group,” said one person close to the nonprofit, who sees errors on all sides. “When you’ve pissed off all the Silicon Valley donors with the way you handled the transition … you lose your Silicon Valley base of funders. I think they can stay stable, but they can’t run the scale of the program that she had planned.”

The group had about $2 million remaining in the bank at the end of 2019, according to a person briefed on the figures, which is $1 million less than what tax records show it had on hand at the end of 2017. Vote.org’s new CEO, Andrea Hailey, was telling people late last year that it was operating on a shoestring budget, although its board members are now said to be personally financing the nonprofit more.

Some people close to the board concede that the group has lost its base of Silicon Valley donors, but they say it is focusing on grassroots donors and that Cleaver’s ouster has improved relations with more traditional funders, like foundations: “One door closed, and another opened,” one person said. (No major gifts have been announced publicly.)

But perhaps the most important consequences have been a series of missteps in Vote.org’s public-facing work that have harmed its most critical asset: its reputation. Text messages sent to voters in Wisconsin this month made no mention of the explosive voting rights fight waging during the coronavirus and encouraged them to vote on Election Day. That angered some Wisconsin leaders who were seeking to delay voting altogether, Recode is told.

And then there was a high-profile screw-up in which Vote.org advertised the wrong date for Election Day on six billboards in parts of Mississippi with large black populations last November, a gaffe that angered its principal partner in the state and triggered a round of damaging headlines.

The error on the billboards wasn’t entirely Vote.org’s fault, but a vendor’s. Nevertheless, it was deeply embarrassing for the organization, and some people believe it wouldn’t have unfolded the same way with Cleaver.

“We understood the mistake to be a mistake with no malicious intent to confuse our voters. However, the backwash and reality of all this is that folks were still confused and there was never any formal apology made to the communities most impacted by the mistake,” Arekia Bennett, the head of Mississippi Votes, Vote.org’s partner, told Recode. “MS Votes reached out for a debrief post-election and never got one. Recently Vote.org has reached out, but we are wary and not sure how or if we want to engage.”

There’s also been an impact on the reputation that’s inherent to losing Cleaver, who is a minor icon in civic circles and has been inextricably linked to Vote.org for a decade, for better or worse. So one of the biggest concerns that even relatively neutral observers voiced is that the brand of Vote.org has been damaged by her firing, which has been widely gossiped about in voter-registration circles.

Some of this brand damage is due, no doubt, to Cleaver herself, who has been more than willing to tell everyone from billionaires to her Facebook friends about her ouster, such as when she bashed them for cutting off her health insurance and telling her Facebook audience that she had “one hell of a story coming.” Critics say that Cleaver’s grudge against the place and people that fired her has harmed the movement. The incentive is there: Cleaver’s new organization, VoteAmerica, is a direct competitor to Vote.org.

“For everyone who called, I told them faithfully what happened. But these people are free to make their own decisions,” Cleaver told Recode. “They fired me in retaliation and still expected nothing but the utmost discretion. And I have a professional reputation as well.”

Even defenders of the board privately concede that it mishandled public communication about Cleaver’s exit. Cleaver had also been able to shape the narrative because Vote.org had said next to nothing publicly or even privately to its supporters about what happened.

What happened at Vote.org

Vote.org’s board, which Cleaver had recruited over the prior two years, had generally given its CEO a long leash, like most volunteer boards do. But things began to sour at the start of 2019 as the board began to scrutinize Cleaver’s performance, according to people close to the board. They felt that she wasn’t prioritizing fundraising enough, and that she was hamstringing the organization’s growth by not hiring a chief operating officer. They were also growing concerned about reports of how Cleaver treated her employees, which ended up being the catalyst for the accusations and counter-accusations that led to her boardroom firing — and eventually, to a number of key donors pulling their support.

The snowballing began when an employee who clashed with Cleaver voluntarily resigned in May, but the board awarded him a $40,000 severance payment anyway. Cleaver alleged this move violated the law, leading her to ask the board to resign.

Critics say that Vote.org no longer appears to be prioritizing the grunt work of researching and activating unlikely voters

Just before she was fired that August, Cleaver even tried to leverage a potential donation, convincing a donor named Sage Weil to pledge $4 million to Vote.org, which would have been the biggest gift ever to the nonprofit — but it was conditional on her remaining the group’s CEO.

“It had never occurred to me that Vote.org could exist without Debra,” Weil told Recode.

But the board wouldn’t relent. It zeroed in on reports, including some that came in unsolicited over LinkedIn’s InMail, that Cleaver, described by even her allies as bulldozing and brawling, could be a harsh and volatile boss. Some former employees told Recode that she presided over a culture that could border on “bullying” and “toxic,” descriptions that Cleaver and her supporters say are sharply gendered.

Cleaver had a tendency to bombard employees with blunt messages on Slack, especially late at night, former employees say. Former employees also say that she was quick to disparage her own colleagues and partners behind their backs, often calling them “idiots.”

“Am I a demanding boss who pays well and expects excellent work product? Yes,” Cleaver told Recode. “We weren’t running a fruit stand. We were running nationwide voter-registration and get-out-the-vote drives in a country with a fragile and crumbling democracy.”

Despite these complaints, the board never conducted an independent investigation or placed her on a performance-improvement plan. They did ask her to take a sabbatical and assigned her an executive coach, but board defenders feel that she didn’t engage seriously. They officially fired Cleaver in August.

Cleaver believes that her firing had nothing to do with her performance, but that the board retaliated against her as a “whistleblower” after she confronted them about the severance payment.

Tempers got hotter, not colder, when they terminated her. Key partners and donors to Vote.org, including Hoffman, were blindsided when they received a mass email blast that August saying that Cleaver was out. They would spend the fall fighting bitterly with the board to return her to her role.

Over the next few weeks, donors led by Goldstein, the young entrepreneur who had planned, in the distant future, to leave $1 million to Vote.org in his will, began demanding that the board reinstate Cleaver or at least explain why they fired her. Goldstein organized a coalition of wealthy backers that included some of Silicon Valley’s marquee names like Altman, who altogether claimed they were responsible for 60 percent of all the money raised by or pledged to the nonprofit.

“Today Vote.org appears to lack leadership and strategy. Vote.org seems to be losing funders, key partners, and essential consultants, and there is a risk of the remaining full-time employees resigning,” the donors wrote the board in a formal letter around Labor Day. “Vote.org’s future is uncertain.”

They prepared to go public with their complaints that fall, but at the last minute, Hoffman’s team — Hoffman conspicuously had not signed Goldstein’s letter — intervened. An operative who worked for him, Tamer Mokhtar, who declined to comment, embarked on a last-ditch mission to try to broker a truce. He flew to Los Angeles, without the other donors’ knowledge, and floated a compromise to the board, but the talks fell apart.

The donors didn’t end up going public, but now Hoffman, its biggest donor to the tune of $3.8 million, is no longer currently planning to fund Vote.org going forward. Hoffman prides himself on only backing founders.

The best- and worst-case scenarios for democracy

So where does this leave Vote.org? The best-case scenario for democracy is that Cleaver and Vote.org manage to build two distinct, successful organizations, creating a redundancy in the voter-turnout universe that experts say isn’t always a bad thing. There are already a half-dozen other groups doing this work, such as Rock the Vote, and there’s been booming donor demand in this space since 2016.

“It may well be that Debra does her thing and [Vote.org] does theirs, and combined they are about as effective as [Vote.org] was in the past,” Donald Green, a political scientist who is unaffiliated with the group but pays close attention to it, told Recode.

The worst-case scenario? That the iciness between the two teams creates factions in the generally cozy voter-engagement world that makes working together impossible. Or that the runup to the 2020 election resembles the runup to the 2019 election, when some employees felt that Vote.org was rudderless, partially because they had to deal with Cleaver’s actions after she left. The complaints submitted by Cleaver and a major donor to the California attorney general show that she has no intention of burying the hatchet.

Another troubling possible outcome is that Vote.org might struggle to rebuild its donor base and may no longer afford to execute its same work. To this day, many donors remain frustrated that they have not been told why Cleaver was fired — the only public comment came on a little-noticed podcast where the new CEO said she was terminated due to “differences in opinion” — which could leave the organization underfunded for 2020. Its two biggest donors, Hoffman and Weil, are now considering funding Cleaver’s new nonprofit, which is doing similar work and has raised $4 million.

“The danger in this type of setting is whether she takes all the funders with her,” said David Nickerson, who ran the experiments department of the Obama reelection campaign.

But neither Cleaver nor Vote.org can rebuild overnight. And with six months to Election Day, the clock is ticking.

"['Peter Kafka', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-26,Strategy behind Trump’s newest coronavirus tweet: Confusion,"President Donald Trump has several huge fights on his hands: America is under attack from a brutal pandemic. Its economy is collapsing. And he is facing a difficult reelection campaign.

In the absence of real plans to solve any of these, Trump is relying on a move that comes reflexively for him: blasting out messages that are either pointless digressions or outright lies — not to persuade people, but to distract and confuse them.

Take, for instance, a tweet he took the time to fire off Saturday afternoon that seemed petty even by his own Twitter standards: He wanted people to know exactly whom he was talking to when he made his jaw-dropping remarks last week about injecting light and disinfectant to cure Covid-19.

Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking & asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt & sick! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2020

Like other things Trump says, this one has elements of truth embedded in a slurry of falsehood. We can sort through that shortly.

What’s more important than the message here is the tactic he’s using. Trump isn’t really interested in correcting the record, but he does want to create doubt. And that’s because a fog of generalized distrust is one of Trump’s primary political tools, as journalism critic Jay Rosen has pointed out.

“The Republican Party and the Trump campaign and the MAGA coalition are going to have to produce confusion and doubt on a scale that is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before,” Rosen told me in a recent conversation. “The key for the Trump campaign is to create confusion, not belief. And that’s what we’re going to see in the months ahead: the massive effort to create doubt and confusion about things that are overwhelmingly clear from the public record.”

Trump’s message this weekend is a perfect encapsulation of the strategy. It doesn’t exonerate him in any way. But it is supposed to chip away at the authority of the media outlets that cover him. The accumulated weight of these niggles is meant to dissuade persuadable voters from believing ... anything.

Surrounding a little bit of truth with a lot of misleading other stuff helps create distrust

Trump does have the smallest of points with respect to his Saturday tweet: At various points in his April 23 press conference, he was indeed addressing Bill Bryan, an official from the Department of Homeland Security, who had given a presentation about how sunlight might affect the coronavirus.

In the viral clip where Trump muses about bringing UV light inside the body or using an “injection” of disinfectant, Trump is talking to Bryan, who is sitting next to Birx, but mostly obscured by Trump’s podium.

""The disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning. It gets in the lungs"" -- Trump seems to suggests that injecting disinfectant inside people could be a treatment for the coronavirus pic.twitter.com/amis9Rphsm — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 23, 2020

And the viral clip of Birx reacting to Trump’s comments can make it appear as if he was talking to her:

On the other hand, Trump did indeed spend some of the press conference telling Birx she should be looking into his idea that you could “apply light and heat to cure.”

Get a load of Dr. Birx's demeanor after Trump tells her, ""I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure [coronavirus]."" pic.twitter.com/TP0QoSzkYl — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 23, 2020

It’s even spelled out in the White House’s transcript of the event:

THE PRESIDENT: Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus? DR. BIRX: Not as a treatment. I mean, certainly fever — THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. DR. BIRX: — is a good thing. When you have a fever, it helps your body respond. But not as — I’ve not seen heat or (inaudible). THE PRESIDENT: I think it’s a great thing to look at. I mean, you know. Okay?

But of course it doesn’t matter at all whether Trump was speaking to Birx or Bryan during the event. What matters is that he was telling government officials — on camera, at his press conference — that he has nonsensical and potentially dangerous ideas about how Americans should respond to the pandemic.

Trump first floated his “I was talking to him, not her” defense on Friday, but that was only in passing. At the time, he was focused on his argument that his light/disinfectant theories weren’t theories at all — he was being sarcastic.

TRUMP: I was looking at you yesterday when I was being sarcastic about disinfectants



JEFF MASON: I wasn't there yesterday



ANOTHER REPORTER: You were looking at Dr Birx



TRUMP: I was looking at Bill, the doctor, I was looking at some of the reporters



*changes topic* pic.twitter.com/h8VxIknuey — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 24, 2020

But the sarcasm argument quickly fizzled — even Fox News wouldn’t support it — so Trump has moved on to a new one.

Maybe he’ll stick with it. Maybe he won’t. But the underlying strategy is one the president clearly believes in. He used it separately Saturday over a different point: relitigating whether he called the coronavirus a “hoax,” or if he was calling critics of his slow, ineffective response to the virus a “hoax.”

The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a “Hoax”, I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with “one person from China”, and then grew, & will be a “Miracle” end! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2020

And just in case you missed it, Trump tried it again, seven hours later:

I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out & embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2020

You can go to the tape on this one, too, and find evidence to support Trump.

On the other hand, if you do watch the same tape, you’ll see that on February 28, Trump was boasting about “losing nobody, so far” to the virus, compared to reports of “35, and 40,000 people — and we’ve lost nobody.”

The CDC now says the virus has killed more than 50,000 in the US.

But, again: Trump and his team don’t expect you to go to the tape or spend more than a second thinking about this.

All they want is for you to doubt the things you see, hear, and read. And they’ll keep at it.

"['Sara Morrison', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,Facebook’s latest ripoff product is a Zoom clone called “Rooms”,"Facebook is rolling out its own video conferencing service called Messenger Rooms. The chat tool looks and works a lot like the popular (but troubled) video chat app Zoom. You might even say Facebook ripped off all the good features that made Zoom so successful while dumping the ones that made it so controversial. Facebook does this all the time.

Like many other apps, Messenger Rooms lets multiple people video chat at the same time. Rooms allows for up to 50 people to join, which is more than the 32 people who can FaceTime simultaneously and less than the 100 people who can join a Zoom meeting. Unlike Zoom, which caps free sessions at 40 minutes, Messenger Rooms has no time limit.

You can create rooms from within a Facebook Group, create one as an event and invite certain users to attend, or start one through your News Feed. Facebook says your invitees don’t even have to have a Facebook account to participate, nor will they have to download an additional app to use it. They can just access the room through a link. This is the kind of seamless ease of use that made Zoom the king of video chatting apps, and now Facebook appears to want the throne.

“Facebook has felt the demand for real-time video,” the company said in its blog post announcing the feature, which is one way of saying that we’re all locked inside our homes and so must seek human contact, for which we are increasingly desperate, through remote means. “Spending time with each other should be spontaneous, not strained,” the blog post argues.

It looks as though Facebook wants to set itself apart with the privacy and security features built into Rooms — features that seem to be inspired by Zoom’s missteps. The room creator can control the room’s visibility, members, and lock it to prevent outsiders from joining to avoid Zoombombers (or Roombombers, as they’d be called in this case). Facebook says it will only ask for a name for users joining rooms who are not logged into Facebook, and that’s only for the purposes of identifying them to fellow room members. It will collect device data from all users, but that’s typical of every website and app.

Beneath the surface, Facebook says it has made room links “difficult for hackers to guess” — an issue for Zoom that predates its pandemic popularity. The company also claims it will not use any audio or video from Rooms to “inform ads.” Finally, Rooms content is encrypted, as is all Messenger content. Facebook stresses that it isn’t end-to-end encrypted due to the difficulties of doing this for video chats with multiple participants. (For what it’s worth, Zoom is also not end-to-end encrypted, even though it once claimed it was.) It’s ultimately a bit ironic to see Facebook positioning itself as a videoconferencing service that’s more secure than Zoom, which has been plagued by privacy issues lately. Facebook’s had more than a few privacy issues of its own.

Just hours before announcing Rooms, Facebook announced that a federal court approved its $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the culmination of the FTC’s investigation into Facebook’s role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Part of the settlement includes compliance and oversight requirements. Facebook has already implemented most of these, which actually puts it ahead of Zoom when it comes to instituting such measures.

Rooms is not Facebook’s first attempt to get into the group video chat space. It’s not even the first time Facebook has been inspired to knock off another company’s video chat service. Earlier this month, Facebook debuted a desktop-only app for group video chats, something that looked a bit like the group video chat feature for Messenger that Facebook introduced back in December 2016. At the time, that effort seemed suspiciously similar to the then-nascent and younger-user-skewing Houseparty app (which has also seen its popularity grow during the pandemic). This was years after Facebook partnered with Skype to introduce a video chatting feature to the social media platform (but not anymore).

Facebook Rooms is actually just the latest in a long line of products that Facebook has copied from its competitors. Facebook offerings like Stories, Marketplace, Live, and Pay are versions of features first found on Snapchat, Craigslist, Periscope, and Venmo, respectively. In the case of photo sharing and encrypted messaging, Facebook simply bought the leading competitors: Instagram and WhatsApp. In fact, it’s hard to think of a Facebook feature or product that is original — including Facebook itself, which was just an iteration of earlier social networking sites Myspace and Friendster.

Messenger Rooms will start to go live this week. Depending on which country you live in, it might be a few weeks before it comes to you. Facebook says you’ll be able to create a room only from Facebook and Messenger at first, but it’s working on integrating Rooms with its Instagram, WhatsApp, and Portal apps.

"['Sara Morrison', 'Apr']",2020-04-24,Why America’s coronavirus testing problem is still so difficult to solve,"After weeks of social distancing, lockdowns, and quarantines, federal and some state governments are starting to issue guidelines for reopening and getting back to something approaching normal. Testing is a key part of that, and most experts say the United States isn’t doing enough. In fact, it’s not even close.

While President Donald Trump just signed the latest relief bill, which allocates $25 billion for testing, there are many barriers preventing the country from deploying the kind of mass testing program it needs. There are shortages of supplies and, until that $25 billion is distributed, funding. There’s also no comprehensive national plan to distribute tests to the places they’re needed most. This lack of planning goes back to the pandemic’s early days, when systemic failures significantly delayed coronavirus tests from rolling out and left the US trailing in testing capacity compared with other countries. For these reasons, the number of tests performed has plateaued at about 150,000 per day in the US. Experts say we need several times that.

“We need to significantly ramp up not only the number of tests, but the capacity to perform them, so that you don’t have a situation where you have a test but it can’t be done because there isn’t a swab, or because there isn’t extraction media, or not the right vial,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Time in late April. “I am not overly confident right now at all that we have what it takes to do that. We are doing better, and I think we are going to get there, but we are not there yet.”

So what will it will take to ramp up testing to a level that allows the US to start easing social distancing? It’s complicated. The available tests aren’t as dependable as they could be, and the labs required to process them need to increase capacity. On top of that, the country needs more public health personnel to carry out the test as well as to run the labs. Then, of course, this will all cost a lot of money. These things are not necessarily impossible tasks, though the road ahead looks tough.

Covid-19 tests, explained

There are two types of Covid-19 tests: molecular and serological. Molecular tests look for the presence of a virus’s genetic material, showing that there is an active infection. Those are the tests that require a swab to be shoved through the back of your nose and into your throat to collect a specimen (although — good news — the FDA recently authorized specimen collection by swabbing around the nostrils, and there’s a new test that uses only saliva).

Serological tests look for antibodies to the virus in the blood, the presence of which indicates there was an infection in the past. While the molecular tests for Covid-19 have been around since the beginning of February, serological tests weren’t authorized until April 1. Many people see these tests as a way to prove immunity against the virus, allowing those who test positive to resume their normal lives, free from the threat of contracting the virus again. Some countries are even using serological test results to issue “immunity passports” to citizens who test positive. Here’s some bad news on that front: Experts warn that we don’t yet know for sure that these antibodies confer immunity, nor for how long that immunity lasts if they do.

“We have no idea whether the presence of antibodies correlates with immunity,” said Dr. Gary Procop, director of clinical virology at the Cleveland Clinic and the chair of the Institute for Science, Technology and Public Policy at the American Society for Clinical Pathology.

“People are making that leap of faith, and I wouldn’t make it,” Procop added. “We don’t use serologic testing for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Why do we think we should be able to use it here?”

(If you really want to go in-depth into how these tests work, Scientific American has a great primer on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.)

Because the FDA approval process takes such a long time, coronavirus tests are instead given an Emergency Use Authorization. As of April 24, 59 molecular and 4 serological tests have received this authorization. There are also nearly 100 tests that do not yet have that authorization but which the agency is allowing to be used in order to get more tests out there sooner. In addition, the FDA has given some state health departments the right to approve tests without waiting for or needing FDA authorization.

While it’s clearly good to have tests available, the lack of strict oversight from the FDA and real-world testing that would typically occur as part of the approval process has led to some tests having significant issues with accuracy. On April 2, the Wall Street Journal said doctors were seeing about a 70 percent sensitivity rate in some molecular tests, which means 30 percent of patients were getting false negatives. Over time, these numbers should improve. No test is perfect, but ABC News reported that a similar molecular test for the flu has a 90 to 95 percent sensitivity rate.

Another issue is that not every lab can run every type of test kit — far from it. So while there may be a surplus of one company’s test kit, the only labs that can run that particular test may not have the capacity, while other labs that do have the capacity may not have the materials required to do so. The BBC compared it to expecting Chevy truck parts to fit a Prius.

For the most part, molecular tests must be performed in a laboratory, with — and this is a very simplified summary of the process — a medical technologist preparing the specimen, running it through a machine, and then manually reading and interpreting the results. Just the machine part of the process takes several hours. Factor in the time it takes to get the test to the lab, and you’re likely looking at a one or two day turnaround (if there’s a lab on-site that can do the test, obviously, it would be much less). If the lab has a backlog, the turnaround will be a lot longer.

That’s what makes “point of care” tests so appealing. These can be done in a matter of minutes at the same place where the specimen is collected — for instance, at a drive-in testing site or at an urgent care center. Abbott Lab’s ID NOW machine can get a positive result in five minutes, while the Cepheid GeneXpert can do it in 45. These tests are molecular tests but use a different method than the PCR tests performed in laboratories. They’re also generally less accurate.

Trump introduced the ID NOW machine to the country in a March 29 press conference, where he displayed the toaster-sized, 6.6 pound machine upside down. Eager to anoint the newest immediate solution to this massive and complex worldwide problem, the president called the test a “whole new ballgame.” But there have been issues with the test, such as accuracy and availability falling far short of what the administration initially promised.

“These tests are performing terribly,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, bluntly stated in a recent Project on Government Oversight panel discussion.

For its part, Abbott Labs told the Wall Street Journal that it has distributed 600,000 test cartridges as of April 19, adding “we’ve been clear from the outset on what we could initially provide, and we’ve met every commitment.” The company is currently manufacturing 50,000 test cartridges a day, but the number of test cartridges does not mean that many tests can be run. As the machines can only do one test at a time, point-of-care testing capacity really depends on how many machines there are. (Laboratory PCR tests, on the other hand, take longer to run but can test many specimens simultaneously.) According to NPR, there are 18,000 ID NOW machines in the country. Cepheid says there are 23,000 GeneXpert machines globally. So having a point-of-care machine, say, at the entrance to every workplace, school, or airport across the country — not to mention a trained person to run the rest, wearing the necessary PPE — simply isn’t realistic yet.

At-home tests could make things even easier, but taking the collection and testing process out of the hands of trained professionals introduces another set of problems. Many people can’t even put on masks correctly. Expecting them to properly collect a specimen, pack it, and ship it to a lab might be too much. For these reasons, the FDA has been slow to authorize any test kits with any at-home element, only doing so for one kit so far. This test, the LabCorp COVID-19 RT-PCR, allows people to collect their own specimens, which they then send to the lab to be processed.

“Any at-home test, there’s always an issue of specimen acquisition,” Procop told Recode. “Did the person get the swab up their nose far enough? ... There may be issues of people who only do the front part of their nose where the virus doesn’t really live, and that may decrease the sensitivity a little bit. But, for the most part, it’ll probably be okay.”

A test that can be performed entirely at home, no trained clinicians or expensive lab equipment needed, sounds great, too. It’s a goal some researchers think they can achieve. MIT Technology Review recently wrote about efforts to create such tests. A completely at-home test for a virus isn’t unheard of. You can buy at-home HIV tests at the drug store, but that test detects antibodies and antigens, which take a while to form so early cases would be missed. Also, it was more than 30 years from the time HIV was first widely known to the point when this test got approved by the FDA.

“I think that’ll be a long way off,” Procop said of the possibility of a completely at-home Covid-19 test.

Why the US isn’t testing enough

Creating a coronavirus diagnostic test is only the first step of a long process that might lead to widespread use. The test still has to be manufactured, distributed, and administered at the mass scale required. Here is where we are really seeing the impact of the delays and a lack of funding and guidance from the federal government.

Some of these problems were unavoidable. For example, when the coronavirus outbreak started earlier this year, the supply chain for these tests simply didn’t exist at the scale needed, so many testing companies faced shortages of everything from swabs to reagents (chemicals used to create the reaction needed to detect the virus in molecular tests). The FDA has tried to help by authorizing other materials to be used for swabs, but again, there are only so many materials that can collect specimens, and the FDA warns that its substitute swab material recommendations “are based on limited available evidence.”

Scaling up the production of reagents is even more complicated. These compounds include DNA components, enzymes, and saline solutions.

“Pretty complicated biochemistry,” Procop said. “And, of course, the companies have to make these under certain conditions. ... They have to make very complicated products in a very controlled manner.”

There are signs that testing capacity is starting to improve. According to the COVID Tracking Project, over 311,000 were run on April 22. This is the most tests performed so far in a single day and represents more than twice the average number of daily tests during the month of April, when the average floated around 150,000. That said, the number of daily tests dropped back down to around 190,000 on April 23, so it remains unclear if the US can maintain a high level of capacity.

Quest Diagnostics, one of the largest lab companies in America, told Recode that it is now running 50,000 coronavirus diagnostic tests per day, and has eliminated the backlog that once caused significant delays in reporting results.

“That capacity meets demand,” Quest told Recode. “If the demand were higher, we would explore way to accommodate that. We may very well be able to accommodate increased demand (depending on the amount) with our current setup. To increase capacity, we may explore bringing up test capabilities in additional labs or other means.”

The demand for testing right now does not necessarily line up with the level of testing that experts believe we need to ease social distancing. Some plans call for 1 to 2 million tests a day for this to happen; one calls for 100 million per day. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA director for Trump who wrote a roadmap to reopening the economy for the American Enterprise Institute, told Vox that these shortages were not simple to fix, as the materials come from other countries — all of which need these supplies for their own tests — and manufacturers would have to take the time to set up a new source in America:

Getting to the point where you have a 2-3 million test capacity per week — which is probably where you need to be initially as you do this transition — is going to be very hard. We’ve tapped out the available platforms and now we’re dependent upon creating new platforms and new supply chains to fuel those platforms. We’re approaching an upper limit in spare capacity. The question is how fast can Abbott and other companies build new testing platforms? And how fast can LabCorp and Quest scale up new labs that didn’t exist before?

Then there’s the issue of having enough trained personnel to run those labs and machines.

“If we’re talking about doubling or tripling our capacity, that would require, for some of our members, retraining staff specifically for these tests,” Louise Serio, spokesperson for the American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA), which represents commercial labs, told Recode. “It may mean hiring more staff. That would be a piece that is necessary to significantly expand the capacity — in addition to obviously having access to those very high-throughput platforms [machines that can run many samples at once].”

One medical laboratory scientist and teaching specialist told ACLA that she is now working 50 to 70 hours to train medical technologists who work in departments to run molecular tests.

But say we do manage to get all the supplies, machines, and people needed to do the number of tests that will let the country ease social distancing without endangering more lives. Then, those tests have to be given to the people and places that need them. That’s a massive undertaking, too.

How the US compares to other countries

Until recently, the US lagged behind many other countries in its testing. Though President Trump famously said in the beginning of March that “anybody who wants a test gets a test,” this has never been true. Trump has made big promises that companies like Google, Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Rite-Aid, and CVS would work with the administration to facilitate access to testing, but the reality has fallen far short of expectations.

As of April 23, the US has performed about 4.6 million tests, currently completing an average of about 150,000 tests per day. But the testing rate has plateaued there, rather than steadily scaling up to reach the level experts say that’s needed. This might indicate that America has reached its testing capacity, and tests still aren’t readily available in many areas, or have been restricted only to people who fit certain criteria.

There’s also a problem with how the US is testing. America currently has a test positivity rate — the percentage of positive tests in all tests conducted — of 20 percent. For perspective, that’s 10 times higher than South Korea’s. Harvard epidemiologist William Hanage told NPR that a 10 percent positivity rate or lower is a good benchmark for an adequate testing program. A high positivity rate, like the 20 percent number in the US, could indicate that tests are only being done on the people most likely to have the virus, which means many people still aren’t being tested.

“The high positivity rates on #COVID19 testing would suggest our testing capacity is still too low,” Gottlieb tweeted. “At the current levels of infection, to achieve a positivity rate of 1%, we would need to have conducted 70+ million covid tests.”

That said, where America was once embarrassingly behind on testing, it has recently caught up to some of its peers. It now tests more people per capita than South Korea, to which its testing rate was once unfavorably compared. In both the US and South Korea, the first coronavirus case was diagnosed on the same day: January 21. The initial response could not have been more different. While South Korea ramped up testing quickly and was able to minimize the spread of the virus, the United States took its time, rejecting the World Health Organization’s test protocol to develop its own through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the meantime, the Trump administration and some health agencies repeatedly downplayed the virus’s threat to the American public.

When the CDC’s tests were released, they were flawed. The tests were also only given to people who fit strict guidelines, and could only be performed by a few CDC-approved labs. It wasn’t until the end of February that the FDA allowed commercial labs to test for the coronavirus and use their own tests, which greatly expanded testing capacity. At this point, however, the virus was already widespread. By the end of March, the per capita testing rate in South Korea was six times that of the US. Even with its progress, America still lags behind countries including Germany, Canada, Spain, and Italy in per capita testing.

“The idea of anybody getting [a test] easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that,” Fauci said in a March 12 hearing. “Do I think we should be? Yes, but we’re not.”

South Korea and Germany, by contrast, were prepared. South Korea learned from its mistakes in the 2015 MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, and therefore had a better response system in place, including an invasive contact tracing system that likely wouldn’t be accepted by the American public. Germany thought ahead and got test kits together before the virus ever hit the country. As of April 24, Germany had just over 150,000 coronavirus cases and about 5,500 deaths. On the same day, the US had over 870,000 cases and just over 50,000 deaths. Germany and South Korea also have effective systems to keep track of infected people and centralized public health care systems. The United States does not.

The population of the US is several times larger than Germany’s and South Korea’s combined, which obviously makes testing and supply shortages a bigger issue. That’s an excuse, but not a complete one. If anything, South Korea may have a surplus of tests, as it is now sending some to America. Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan was able to secure 500,000 test kits from the country after a frustrating and futile effort to get them from American suppliers (he then thanked the federal government for “generously offering” the use of labs to run those tests), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) purchased 750,000 tests from South Korea in mid-April.

All that said, America has still managed to keep its death rate lower than many of Germany’s peers, including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain, France, and Italy. This is assuming that countries are accurately tracking and reporting all of their cases and deaths. As the New York Times recently reported, coronavirus death tolls have likely been undercounted worldwide, and the lack of testing makes it impossible to truly know how many cases there are.

But while the US isn’t the only country to face dire consequences for failing to adequately prepare and respond to the pandemic, it does have the most known cases of and deaths from the virus than any other country.

The big mass testing hurdle laboratories can’t solve: money

How many tests do we really need? As noted above, the number of tests experts believe the US should perform varies quite a bit. The higher estimates call for testing the entire US population every three to four days in order to catch the virus before an infected person can spread it to someone else.

Still, many plans call for millions of tests per day. Dr. Brett Giroir, the Trump administration’s testing czar, has called for a number on the lower end of those estimates, saying he thinks the country will need 4.5 million tests per month. And the Harvard Global Health Institute’s director Ashish Jha told the New York Times that at least 152 tests per 100,000 people should be performed daily (that’s about three times more than the current average). A recently released Harvard report, “Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience,” put the number at 5 million per day by early June (for a “safe social reopening”), scaled up to 20 million per day by late July (to “fully mobilize the economy”). Even that, the report says, may not be enough.

In any case, experts do agree that testing must be accompanied by contact tracing and people continuing to practice things like good hygiene, social distancing, and quarantine if they suspect they are sick.

So, how do we scale up from about 150,000 tests a day to millions of tests per day? And why aren’t we doing that many already? A lot of it comes down to money — and not just money so that patients can afford the tests. We’ve seen the government provide funding for this already. The country’s health system needs money for the tremendous additional upfront cost for the machines, equipment, supplies, and personnel.

“There’s been a disconnect between everyone agreeing that testing is essential to our way out of this and the government’s willingness to invest in the large commercial laboratories who are performing the majority of the testing in the US to have this national network,” said Serio, from the ACLA.

Keep in mind that many of these items will no longer be needed once the pandemic passes, making them a bad investment for labs. Even the biggest labs are already under financial strain. And while the larger commercial labs might be able to absorb the additional cost of more machines, smaller ones can’t. While the demand for coronavirus tests is clearly there, testing overall has actually declined — people aren’t having elective surgeries or getting routine bloodwork done for their annual physicals these days. Quest recently furloughed 4,000 employees and issued pay cuts after it saw a 40 percent decrease in overall testing volume.

So, who will pay for it? For some context, let’s look at the ventilator shortage, where there was a similar issue: Hospitals couldn’t afford to buy the expensive machines they likely wouldn’t need once the pandemic was over. The federal government eventually spent $3 billion to purchase hundreds of thousands of them for the Strategic National Stockpile, which can then be distributed as needed across the country.

The Trump administration has been reluctant to pay for a testing program, even though the need for tests was apparent even before the need for ventilators. Trump himself dismissed the notion of the federal government being involved in testing as “ridiculous,” tweeting that it is “the States” that “have to step up their TESTING!” Earlier this month, the federal government stopped funding testing sites, saying they would be left to states to manage instead.

States, on the other hand, have appealed to the federal government for the funding they say they need to set up testing programs, including in an April 21 letter to Congress from the National Governors Association. Most states have balanced budget requirements, which makes it extremely difficult or even impossible for them to suddenly spend huge amounts of money on a testing system whilst simultaneously taking in far less tax revenue than anticipated, due to businesses shutting down and people being laid off. The federal government, on the other hand, routinely spends more money than it takes in — hence America’s ballooning national debt.

The good news is that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services increased its reimbursement amount for coronavirus tests from $51 to $100 in the hopes that getting more money per test would encourage labs to invest in what they need to run more tests (Medicare and Medicaid typically reimburse providers far less than the market rate, meaning providers sometimes lose money on those patients). The first relief bill, signed in March, paid for testing for uninsured patients. The $25 billion in the relief bill for coronavirus testing includes funding for items needed to increase capacity. Once the funding is there, the federal and states government will have to decide where and how to distribute it. How much labs will actually get, then, is still in question.

“ACLA urges HHS to quickly provide clarity on how the funding will be allocated to support hotspots and high-risk populations, as well as broader efforts to increase high throughput testing nationwide,” ACLA President Julie Khani said in a statement. “Continued support and funding for high throughput testing from commercial, hospital, and academic laboratories is essential to achieve both of these goals.”

But this $25 billion provision wasn’t in initial versions of the bill and was only the result of a week of negotiations to add it — Democrats wanted it, Republicans didn’t — indicating that, even now, with the federal government desperate to re-open the country, getting the funds necessary to safely do so from it is still a struggle.

The fault lies at the top. Trump once said he’d rather keep sick people on a cruise ship, potentially infecting the rest of the passengers, than let them on American land because it would increase the number of coronavirus cases. The president is reportedly far more concerned with keeping the number of confirmed cases down than he is with minimizing the actual number of cases. In that case, mass testing is not in Trump’s best interests, even if it is in his country’s.

Which is tough. After all the issues America has had so far with its Covid-19 testing system — developing new tests, fixing supply chains, getting them to the people who need them, allowing more labs to perform them, and scaling up the capacity of those labs to run these complicated molecular tests at an unprecedented rate — securing the funds to make it all work requires support from the federal government. That means the decision to ramp up testing in the United States likely depends on the whims of President Trump. This is the same man who, when he declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak, said about testing, “I don’t take responsibility at all.”

"['Jason Del Rey', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,Did Amazon lie to Congress? Top antitrust lawmakers want to know.,"Two US members of Congress overseeing an antitrust investigation into Amazon want to know if a top official for the company lied while giving congressional testimony about whether or not the e-commerce giant unfairly competes against smaller, independent sellers on its marketplace.

The representatives are reacting to a report from the Wall Street Journal that revealed Amazon employees have at times accessed data from individual marketplace sellers to help decide which products Amazon would create and sell under its own brand names, known as private-label brands. The report appears to contradict statements made under oath by a top Amazon lawyer, Nate Sutton, who stated at a congressional hearing led by one of the lawmakers that Amazon does not use data from individual sellers — and only uses data aggregated from multiple sellers — to create its own products.

In a statement sent to Recode on Thursday, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), who leads the House antitrust subcommittee that is investigating Amazon and other tech giants, said, “At best, Amazon’s witness appears to have misrepresented key aspects of Amazon’s business practices while omitting important details in response to pointed questioning. At worst, the witness Amazon sent to speak on its behalf may have lied to Congress.”

House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY) added, “We plan to seek clarification from Amazon in short order, in light of this troubling report.”

An Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond when Recode questioned them about the politicians’ remarks, but previously said in a statement, “It’s simply incorrect to say that Amazon was intentionally misleading in our testimony. As we told the Wall Street Journal and explained in our testimony, we strictly prohibit employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch. While we don’t believe these claims made by the Wall Street Journal are accurate, we take these allegations very seriously and have launched an internal investigation.”

The question of whether Amazon unfairly competes with the hundreds of thousands of sellers who help line the virtual shelves of The Everything Store has been an area of focus for the congressional antitrust investigation that launched last year, as well as an informal probe by regulators at the Federal Trade Commission. Amazon both acts as a platform on which small and mid-sized merchants can sell directly to Amazon shoppers — these sellers make up nearly 60 percent of all Amazon retail sales — as well as a retailer that competes against these sellers through the sale of its own brands like Amazon Basics, as well as by reselling popular national brands. Other retailers like Walmart and Target also sell successful in-house brands, but politicians like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have argued that Amazon’s unique role as both a platform and a retailer allows it to unfairly compete against its own sellers. Warren last year outlined a plan to separate Amazon’s own lines of brands from the rest of its business in the case that she became president.

The Wall Street Journal, citing former and current employees, reported on Thursday that in “one instance, Amazon employees accessed documents and data about a bestselling car-trunk organizer sold by a third-party vendor. ... Amazon’s private-label arm later introduced its own car-trunk organizers.” The data included nonpublic information like how much advertising the third-party seller spent on Amazon for each unit it sold.

Amazon told the Journal that such behavior would violate its policies, but it is not clear what, if any, safeguards Amazon had put in place to prevent employees from accessing such data. An Amazon spokesperson also told Recode that there was more than one seller of the original car-trunk organizer — meaning the company used data aggregated from multiple sellers — though the Journal reported that the one additional seller sold just 17 units over the period of time in question.

The House antitrust subcommittee overseen by Cicilline originally planned to file a report on its investigation into Amazon, as well as Apple, Google, and Facebook, by the end of March. The coronavirus pandemic has delayed the completion of the report, but Cicilline has said it will still be released, though he didn’t say when.

"['Daniel Markus', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-23,How the coronavirus pandemic will affect an entire generation of students,"Every morning, Michelle Martin-Sullivan rises with her toddler and begins her biggest task of the day: making contact with all her students, who are scattered among the foothills of rural eastern Kentucky. Some she calls by phone, others she chats with over text, and some she sees in class on Zoom.

Like teachers across the US, Martin-Sullivan is working remotely, and the transition has proved difficult almost everywhere. Rollouts of online portals have been plagued with technical issues in many districts, while others have struggled to distribute devices like laptops and iPads amid shortages from suppliers.

For Martin-Sullivan, though, the issues often go deeper than teaching itself. Many of her students are essential workers at stores like Walmart and have begun picking up extra shifts to support their families. Other students, as well as some teachers, don’t have internet access at all.

“Teachers … have been conducting their phone calls and check-ins with students from random parking lots, like church parking lots, the Walmart parking lot, [or] just anywhere that you can get wifi,” she says.

The results of these struggles with distance learning will remain unclear for some time. Many standardized tests have been delayed or canceled, which means school districts won’t get data on their students’ progress.

On this episode of Reset, we explore how the pandemic might affect students going forward, and how long those effects could last.

According to Matt Barnum, a national reporter for the education news site Chalkbeat, traumatic effects have big impacts on students’ lives, both on how much they learn and long-term factors like college enrollment rates and income.

“There’s this idea that children are resilient. They’ll just bounce back from whatever you throw at them. And from a research perspective, that’s just not the case,” he says. “We know that things can affect students, both good or bad. We know that early trauma can affect students for bad. We know that a high-quality teacher or access to early childhood education can affect students for good in the long term. So I think it’s not unreasonable to think that this is going to have long-run negative effects.”

Still, there are ways that policymakers can decrease these negative impacts, as Barnum explained. Research shows that one easy way to help students catch up is to add extra instructional time to the end of the school day or make the school year longer.

“We have evidence from research: There is a study in Florida that when low-performing schools extended the school day, students did better on state tests. We have another study in Louisiana showing that summer school helps students who are struggling in reading,” he says. “And so it just makes a whole lot of sense that if you want to make up for missed instruction, you should just make up for missed instruction.”

For students who have struggled more than their peers, some experts have suggested that the federal government should fund an “army” of recent college graduates to tutor students — with the added benefit of helping prop up a dismal job market.

Finally, students will also likely need emotional support when they go back to school. Aside from the interruption to their education, they may know people who got sick or died from Covid-19.

“If schools want to hit the ground running academically, they also probably need to be thinking about addressing the trauma that students may have faced. Presumably the best way to deal with that is to have trained professionals in schools, who can work with students to talk this through and support them in this,” Barnum says.

Whether government officials will take any of these actions remains to be seen. But policy options that can help students through the pandemic exist. The question is mostly whether governments — especially during a massive economic downturn — will make them happen.

"['Shirin Ghaffary', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,Amazon employees shared an event invite to discuss how the company treats its workers. Then it disappeared.,"Several of Amazon’s corporate employees are urging thousands of their colleagues to defy their employer by taking this Friday off work en masse to instead gather virtually and discuss how to push for more rights for the company’s warehouse workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, several Amazon employees have told Recode that invitations to the virtual event have mysteriously disappeared from their calendars and inboxes.

Workers told Recode they believe Amazon’s management deleted the event in an attempt to quash a growing collaboration between corporate and warehouse-level employees over workers’ labor rights and environmental concerns.

Amazon declined to comment when asked if it had deleted the event.

After an Amazon corporate employee emailed invitations to the event to thousands of colleagues on Tuesday afternoon, the invite had been deleted from many (but not all) employees’ inboxes by Wednesday morning. The controversy around the event demonstrates escalating tensions within Amazon’s workforce, both white-collar and blue-collar, during an unprecedented public health disaster. It’s a critical time for the company to grapple with intensifying internal dissent around how it treats some of its most vulnerable employees.

Amazon has become an essential service for millions of Americans who are on lockdown during the pandemic, which has thrust the company in the spotlight in both positive and negative ways. Amazon’s leadership has called warehouse and delivery workers “heroes” and raised their wages by $2 per hour, but the company has also faced scrutiny from both internal and external critics who say it isn’t doing enough to compensate or protect the health of its workers who are risking their lives to keep its businesses running.

Do you work at Amazon and have thoughts on corporate working conditions or policies? Please email Shirin Ghaffary at shirin.ghaffary@protonmail.com. You can also find her on Twitter at @shiringhaffary; Signal number available upon request.

“Amazon has begun making significant improvements in COVID-19 protections in warehouses, but after hearing from our colleagues working in warehouses throughout the world, we believe there needs to be more protections, transparency, and uncensored, supported space for dialog and deep listening,” the now-deleted invitation said. “If we’re censored and can’t talk with warehouse workers, how can we work with them to make things better?”

The event, which its organizers are calling a “sickout,” will still continue as planned on Friday, and the group organizing it, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, has said in a public blog post that at least 100 employees so far plan to attend, out of Amazon’s hundreds of thousands of corporate employees.

In light of the pandemic, Amazon warehouse workers have demanded greater protections from the company, such as easier access to sick leave and protective gear. While the company has responded to some of the workers’ concerns and is now providing masks and checking employees’ temperatures when they show up for shifts, many workers say these efforts are insufficient. The number of Amazon employees who have tested positive for Covid-19 has grown to include workers from at least 50 US Amazon facilities that remain open for business. Over 300 warehouse workers across 50 sites nationwide have pledged to call in sick this week to put pressure on Amazon to meet demands for greater paid leave and sanitation measures at warehouses that together employ more than 250,000 warehouse workers.

In recent weeks, Amazon’s corporate employees have been increasingly organizing to show support for the company’s warehouse workers. In response, Amazon management has been cracking down on such activity. Last week, the company fired two of its most vocal tech employee critics, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, who were leaders of the worker group that helped organize a similar warehouse worker panel discussion to the one planned for Friday. Employees say that invitations to that event were also deleted, but it went on as planned with over 400 attendees. Cunningham’s and Costa’s firing angered some of their colleagues, who have continued to organize the sickout despite fears that they’ll lose their jobs as a result.

“It’s hard to think of any stronger way to discourage something than deleting a bunch of invites and emails out of the entire companies’ inboxes and calendars and firing everyone involved,” one Amazon employee told Recode, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

With regard to Amazon’s dismissal of Cunningham and Costa, a spokesperson sent the following statement: “We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies.”

The spokesperson declined to respond to a follow-up question about which specific internal policies were violated.

Organizers of Friday’s sickout are calling for Amazon to reinstate “any worker who was fired based on selective enforcement of policies and behavior guidelines.”

Since Amazon’s corporate employees are largely divided from warehouse workers, Friday’s event provides a rare opportunity for software engineers, business analysts, and other white-collar workers to hear directly from their warehouse colleagues about their concerns. Employees also plan to discuss Amazon’s policies around environmental sustainability, which in the past was the primary focus of the group organizing, AECJ.

Amazon has long faced criticism and questioning over its labor practices for warehouse and delivery workers. And in the past, it has successfully dissuaded its workforce from nascent attempts at unionization. But Amazon’s sharpest critics on labor conditions have historically come from outside the company. Unlike some other major tech companies like Google, Amazon’s corporate culture hasn’t been as politically outspoken and until recently, workers have refrained from publicly criticizing company policies. That’s been changing in the past year, as more of its corporate workers have begun pushing back against their employer. Now, during the pandemic, these concerns have intensified — as have management’s attempts to push back.

In recent weeks, the company has fired at least two warehouse worker activists. One of those fired activists, Chris Smalls, was the target of an executive plan to smear his reputation as a “not smart or articulate” leader, according to leaked memo notes from an internal meeting. The circumstances around Smalls’s firing have prompted an investigation by the New York City Human Rights Commission and the New York State Attorney General.

And Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, has also reportedly been building a heat map to track the likelihood of different stores that might attempt to unionize, demonstrating again how much the company is fighting against a growing threat of worker activism.

Amazon is more powerful than ever during this pandemic as more people depend on its services and it faces less competition from now-shuttered brick-and-mortar stores. But as this event and the controversy surrounding it show, the company’s reputation will also be impacted by how it treats its workers, who, despite the risks in doing so, continue to press the company for greater transparency and rights for their colleagues on the front lines.

"['Jason Del Rey', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-22,"Amazon has been frustrating during the pandemic, but Prime is more popular than ever","Sim Kallan has long opposed shopping on Amazon.

“Ordinarily I would NEVER use Amazon,” the El Cerrito, California, resident wrote to Recode in an email. “I hate giving that kind of octopus company my $$ and my valuable personal information.”

But the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 45,000 people in the US and prompted widespread stay-at-home orders, changed all that. Last month, Kallan gave in and signed up for the company’s Prime membership program.

“I’m 70, got [a] couple of health issues that make me terribly vulnerable to the virus,” she said to explain her decision. “I thought I’d never have a reason to join. Sadly, it’s all different now.”

Kallan is one of around 100 readers who responded to a Recode survey about what’s changed in their Amazon shopping experience since the pandemic started. Dozens of them reported that practical challenges have turned the company’s usually reliable service into a frustrating and uncertain process, with delayed shipping dates, limited supplies and services, and confusion as nonessential items like Harry Potter books are delivered sooner than essential ones like toilet paper. Others expressed serious reservations about the company’s business and labor practices. While Kallan says she plans to eventually cancel her membership, most survey respondents say they aren’t going anywhere: Amazon is still their best option — and as Recode has previously reported, that’s probably going to be the case whenever the pandemic ends.

“[U]nfortunately, nothing beats Amazon’s range of products and quick delivery,” Sarah Durham, a 41-year-old Prime member from Plano, Texas, told Recode in a survey response. “Regardless of how I feel about them as a company, I rely too much on their service.”

Responses to Recode’s survey also correspond with new data from two external research firms that shows that Amazon Prime membership sales rose significantly as the coronavirus pandemic spread. Sales of Amazon Prime memberships in the US increased 10 percent year over year for the weeks of March 16 and March 23, according to estimates from the research firm Second Measure, as the virus began to force shutdowns in big metro areas around the country. Those weekly Prime membership increases are the largest for Amazon since early November, a time of year in which the company typically sees a holiday season bump in signups.

At the same time, results from a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) survey show that the rate at which Amazon shoppers converted from a free Amazon Prime trial into a paid Prime member in the first quarter of 2020 was the highest it’s been in two years.

“Prime members do get the quickest shipping … and in times when consumers are concerned about getting the supplies they need, knowing that their order is going through the most efficient shipping channel is probably appealing,” said Josh Lowitz of CIRP.

An Amazon spokesperson would not directly comment on the data from the research firms, but highlighted in a statement that Prime offers many perks beyond fast shipping, such as unlimited streaming of thousands of movies and TV shows.

It’s not surprising that the Amazon shopping experience — and its normal one- and two-day Prime shipping promises — have bent under the weight of pandemic-induced shopping demand. Even retailers with decades more experience like Walmart and Target have had serious trouble keeping high-demand products in stock and are warning customers about significant delays. Lockdowns have shuttered many of Amazon’s brick-and-mortar competitors that sell nonessential items like apparel, and many consumers would rather order essential items like cleaning supplies and canned food from home rather than visit grocery stores that remain open. The company didn’t have much time to prepare for this sky-high demand, and meanwhile, Amazon’s warehouse network has also been disrupted by high rates of absence and new safety measures that can decrease efficiency.

Other types of problems have arisen as Amazon has prioritized shipment of its most in-demand items. For several days in late March, Amazon hid faster delivery options on some nonessential items sold by its own sellers in what the company told Recode was an “unintended” error after I pointed out the issue. That meant Amazon was featuring product listings for certain items in its warehouses that had far-off delivery dates even when marketplace sellers were offering the same products at the same price with earlier delivery promises. In the week that followed the fix, sellers told Recode that Amazon was now displaying artificially late delivery dates for items sellers were shipping themselves, which was scaring off some shoppers. After Recode alerted Amazon, the company called it an “error” and said it fixed the issue.

These errors not only made it more confusing to shop on Amazon, but they also harmed some marketplace sellers who had overhauled their operations to ship items from their own facilities while their inventory in Amazon warehouses wasn’t getting shipped out because the items were deemed nonessential.

“That was catastrophic for five days,” said Matt Altschul, CEO of Smartish, a maker of cellphone cases and other accessories. Smartish’s weekly sales on Amazon were down 50 percent in mid-April from the average weekly total in the eight weeks leading up to mid-March. “Nobody was buying the products. Conversion rates dropped in half.”

Today, Amazon accounts for nearly 40 percent of all US e-commerce sales, and the Prime program is perhaps the biggest reason why. Prime members shop more frequently and spend more annually than non-Prime members do, and they often price-compare across other websites less. Jeff Bezos said in January that Amazon has more than 150 million paying Prime members worldwide, and CIRP estimates there are now 118 million Prime members in the US alone, where most customers pay $119 a year for an annual membership or $12.99 a month.

Yet, the most utilized perk that comes with Prime — two-day and one-day shipping on tens of millions of products for no extra fee — hasn’t been offered for many Amazon products during the pandemic.

For 35-year-old Steve Sanchez of Fresno, California, these shipping delays and other frustrations negated his reason for paying for a Prime membership, so he canceled.

“I understand the Covid-19 pandemic is causing the delays, but for Amazon to still charge full price for their Prime service is ridiculous,” he wrote in a message to Recode. “I am surprised they didn’t waive the monthly fee. It would have been a good PR move on their part. All over Twitter I see people posting about the Prime delays. I’m not the only one who is unhappy.”

But Sanchez seems to be in the minority of Prime members who cancel the service, according to Recode’s survey.

Tiffany Lopinsky, a 26-year-old from Boston, Massachusetts, said Amazon and Prime shipping has still been the best option for ordering online during the pandemic.

“I already shop for 95% of my stuff online, but Amazon has been the most reliable of any retailer I’ve ordered from during the coronavirus outbreak,” she told Recode in a survey response. “I’ve had Target, Walmart, and Chewy online orders canceled or significantly delayed. Amazon has met or exceeded their shipping timeline on every order I’ve placed. Other retailers have overpromised on shipping in order to capture my order, then underdelivered, which I find manipulative and frustrating!”

Lee Hwang, a 52-year-old resident of Berkeley, California, has encountered a host of confusion on Amazon over the past month, but still doesn’t see herself “canceling my Prime membership immediately.”

“For some reason, identical items can have very different delivery dates,” she wrote to Recode. “For example, I wanted a set of polyurethane casters for my office chair. Most of them had delivery dates three weeks out. Some had delivery dates within three days and were only a few dollars more expensive. Pipe wrenches had delivery dates three weeks out, except for a $45 set of three. Why? I don’t know.”

This confusion has prompted Hwang to shop more on Etsy and eBay during the crisis “because availability and pricing at Amazon is so variable and because I wonder about the safety of the company’s warehouse workers.”

Some other survey respondents echoed Hwang’s behavior shift; they are sticking with Prime but also shopping from other shopping sites that they wouldn’t have before, to fill in the gaps. If that behavior becomes widespread, it is possible that some other e-commerce sites besides Amazon will also benefit as more overall shopping transfers to digital storefronts.

But if the shipping delays and other issues connected to the pandemic can’t knock most people off of the Prime bandwagon, it’s hard to imagine something that will.

"['Shirin Ghaffary', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-18,Contact tracing is well underway in Asia. What can the US learn?,"If and when lockdown restrictions are lifted in the US, would you agree to let the government anonymously track your interactions with people within a 6-foot radius to control the spread of Covid-19?

That’s an increasingly urgent question as President Trump and state governors debate how and when to safely reopen the US economy — and as technology is being touted as a solution that would help people reenter public life.

And tech giants are stepping up. Apple and Google have announced a plan to turn phones into opt-in Covid-19 tracking machines that would, if all goes as planned, make it easier for health officials to identify and alert people if they’ve been exposed to the virus.

The idea is familiar because similar tech-based efforts have been underway for weeks and even months in countries like Singapore, China, and Taiwan, where Covid-19 hit earlier than in the US.

But what works in one country won’t necessarily work in the US. Some of these Covid-19 tracking technologies — like mandatory electronic wristbands in Hong Kong that tip off authorities when people under quarantine leave their homes — seem implausible in the US, where for years civil rights advocates have fought to protect people’s online privacy and push back against government surveillance. Apple and Google’s system is being designed to protect the identities of people who use it, but concerns abound that outside parties (including the US government itself) could try to de-anonymize that data.

The stakes are incredibly high for these tools. If they work as intended, they could help end a once-in-a-lifetime public health crisis. But if ineffective, they could provide a false sense of confidence in our abilities to control the virus and allow it to spread further. On top of all that, even if these tech solutions successfully slow Covid-19’s spread in the US, they pose serious, yet-to-be-determined risks to Americans’ privacy. With all that in mind, here’s what we can learn from other countries’ tech-based responses to the coronavirus as the US develops its own.

Technology can help, but it’s just one part of an effective strategy

One of the main ways technology can help stop the spread of the coronavirus is with digital contact tracing, which is the process of identifying people who may have come into contact with the virus.

Traditionally, contact tracing has required human involvement. When someone tests positive for the virus, public health investigators get in touch with them, learn about everyone they’ve been in contact within a certain time frame, and then manually track down and notify all those contacts.

Digital contact tracing automates a part of this process by relying on people’s phones to map out their ongoing web of physical interactions. The Apple-Google system will use a smartphone’s Bluetooth signal to create a log of the people the phone’s user has come into close proximity with, while keeping people’s identities and locations anonymous. As Recode previously described, “It works a bit like exchanging contact information with everyone you meet, except everything is designed to be anonymous and automatic.”

This type of contact-tracing technology is already helping contain the spread of Covid-19 in countries like Singapore and Taiwan — but it has limitations.

“Technology is not a silver bullet, but one way to get information,” said Anne Liu, a global health public health expert at Columbia University who worked on efforts to digitize information collected from patients during the Ebola epidemic. With that caveat, Liu went on to say of the new public health technologies we’re seeing in East Asian countries, “I do think some of this can be especially promising for something that’s moving at the speed that Covid-19 is moving.”

Take Singapore. Although it’s now facing a spike in new cases, the country attracted praise early in the pandemic for its initial success at curbing the spread of the virus. In March, the country released TraceTogether, an app that uses Bluetooth technology to help public health officials do contact tracing. Much like the Apple-Google tool, Singapore’s app automated the process of tracking down every person a given person came into contact within a two-week period. It works by allowing users to log in the app if they test positive for Covid-19 and the tool then anonymously notifies everyone they’ve recently seen.

But not enough people are using it — as of April 1, only 12 percent of people in Singapore had opted to download the contact tracing app. That figure coupled with the second wave of cases might explain why Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien-loong, made a plea to his citizens to download the app in a national address on Tuesday, April 21.

And while the TraceTogether app is one important part of Singapore’s overall early solution, it was only a supplement to a broader, intense series of policy interventions. Those included shutting its borders to Chinese travelers in early February, banning large-scale gatherings, imposing quarantine measures, and mobilizing a team of dedicated contact tracers to investigate cases manually. Despite all this, the country’s government still couldn’t stop the recent resurgence in new cases, which is concentrated among migrant workers living in crowded dormitories.

One of the key government officials helping release Singapore’s app explained the limitations of the technology and made the case for governments to continue investing in human beings to do manual contact tracing in addition to any tools they’re rolling out.

“If you ask me whether any Bluetooth contact-tracing system deployed or under development anywhere in the world is ready to replace manual contact tracing, I will say, without qualification, that the answer is, ‘No,’” Jason Bay, the product lead for TraceTogether, Singapore’s nationwide Bluetooth contact-tracing system, wrote in a blog post on April 10.

Singapore’s experience suggests that it may be difficult to gain widespread voluntary adoption of Apple and Google’s contact-tracing tools when they are released — and even if that’s achieved — there are limits to their effectiveness.

There are privacy trade-offs

In the US, mandatory app-based contact tracing isn’t on the table for now. But in other countries, digital health-tracking is essentially government mandated. And any time technology pulls people’s health data — especially without their input — it poses serious privacy concerns.

China is an example of what is at stake. The country’s government has long employed technology like facial recognition to control the activity of its citizens, including to target ethnic minorities. Now, in response to the pandemic, it is partnering with major tech companies to expand that mass digital surveillance network and tie it to people’s health data.

As the spread of Covid-19 in China began to slow down in mid-February, local governments (outside of Wuhan, where the virus originated) began lifting strict lockdown orders. Soon after, private companies — in partnership with the Chinese government agencies — began rolling out app add-ons that help the government determine who can start safely leaving their house again without infecting others.

Now, before people can do things like ride the subway or enter a crowded shopping mall, they have to prove they’re at low risk of having Covid-19. They do that by scanning a government-mandated QR “health code” on their cellphone that’s either green (likely Covid-19 free), yellow (at risk of Covid-19), or red (likely Covid-19 positive).

It’s not known exactly how the code is calculated, but it’s loosely based on information like a user’s location and their medical and travel history, which is informed in part by a government questionnaire. Tested positive for Covid-19 or have recently traveled to Wuhan? You’re in the red. Healthy and no travel to high-risk areas? You’re in the green.

Currently, people generate these codes in Alipay and WeChat, which are mega-apps in China that nearly every citizen has installed on their phones and that they use to do everything from chatting to buying basic goods to hailing rides.

And in South Korea, the government hasn’t issued people with QR health codes, but it is broadcasting detailed information about infected people’s whereabouts. When someone in South Korea tests positive for Covid-19, government health authorities send regional text alerts, notifying residents that someone near them has the disease and linking to a central website with more information. While the government doesn’t share people’s names, it does provide details on the website, such as the person’s age range, gender, and places they recently visited — which has led people to publicly speculate about their neighbors’ marital affairs and other private matters. Some have argued that this could lead to stigma around being tested for the virus and discourage people from doing so.

The contact-tracing system Google and Apple are working on is notably more privacy-centric than the methods we’re seeing in China or South Korea, but it still poses concerns. The two companies have now committed to shutting down the tool once the pandemic is over — which was a key issue for many privacy experts — but other concerns abound. There are still ways that even the randomly generated Bluetooth keys meant to anonymize users could be linked back to real identities.

Apple and Google are also leaving it up to public health authorities to develop and manage the apps that will use their contact tracing tool. It’s conceivable that those authorities could introduce their own ways to circumvent privacy protections if their governments so desire. The UK’s National Health Service, it was recently reported, was looking into ways to identify users of a contact-tracing app it was developing. In the US, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who is typically on the side of pro-privacy legislation, has already asked Apple and Google how the companies will assure users that the tool protects their privacy. That said, the tool ticked off many of the American Civil Liberty Union’s boxes for what a privacy-friendly contact-tracing tool must do.

People need to use it for it to be effective

For any technological contact-tracing tool to work, it has to have a high percentage of the country using it.

But just how high? Experts aren’t sure yet. A Singapore government official working on the country’s contact-tracing app said it would need to see something like two-thirds of the population or more using it. One researcher at Oxford University who has been modeling the effects of digital contact tracing apps told the Wall Street Journal that you need about 60 percent of the population to opt in for such a tool to be effective. In a press call last week, Apple and Google cited that Oxford research and a similar range for their system to potentially be effective.

In China, health-tracking digital QR codes are used by wide swaths of the population. In the Zheijang province, which is home to 50 million people, the local government says about 90 percent of residents signed up for a code. Of course, that’s because those apps are all but necessary to get around and do basic day-to-day activities like go to work, enter the market, or ride public transit.

In countries where the apps are opt-in rather than mandatory, we’re not seeing adoption rates nearly that high yet.

This raises questions about how the US will be able to convince enough people to download the app, as compared to China’s more mandatory enforcement.

What happens after people are notified of exposure makes a difference

Having an app tell you you’ve been exposed to Covid-19 is helpful, but it’s only the first step we’re seeing in effective international responses to controlling the pandemic.

For these notifications to be of any use, people need access to proper testing, health care systems, and financial support to get through a period of quarantine and potential illness, public health experts cautioned. If you don’t have that, you risk social unrest.

South Korea, for example, had early success flattening its curve thanks to aggressive testing that has been free of cost to its citizens. It also pioneered the drive-through testing model that other countries like the US have followed.

But access to these resources may be harder to roll out at scale in the US, where there’s still a shortage of tests and delays in lab processing, and where health care systems in hot spots such as New York City are overwhelmed. The US has surpassed South Korea in the total number of tests, but adjusted for population, has tested at just 74 percent of the rate of South Korea.

Apple and Google say that in their digital contact-tracing system, once someone is notified they may have been exposed to Covid-19, they’ll receive a message urging them to get tested and self-quarantine. But being cautioned to get tested is one thing; actually having easy access to a test is another.

“If you start coming into contact with someone Covid-19-positive, what is the ability for someone to be evaluated and also tested?” said Dr. Andrew Chan, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Contact tracing won’t be helpful in and of itself if we can’t act on the information we gather.”

Chan recently helped create a mobile app that helps people self-report and track Covid-19 symptoms. The app has been used to confirm previously unknown symptoms of the disease, such as loss of smell and taste, and to understand where the disease is spreading without relying on people getting tested. He said he’s hopeful about the US implementing new technologies around contact tracing but emphasized the need for public health agencies to provide adequate resources to follow up on this new data.

What happens next

Extensive contact tracing is less useful in a region that’s in the middle of an outbreak — like New York and California — where there’s widespread community transmission and people are already sheltering in place in their homes.

But, in the future, when the number of cases in those states eventually declines and when businesses begin to reopen, contact tracing can help people safely reenter society. If someone is deemed high-risk because of exposure to an anonymous contact, they would stay at home for two weeks before they go back to the office or anywhere outside their home.

With contact tracing like that, Liu said, “you can do more of a targeted quarantine, because it can target who to keep in quarantine rather than everyone,” said Liu. “Once you have the contacts [of someone who is diagnosed with Covid-19], then you know who should go into quarantine.”

That’s happening by force in places like Taiwan, where most people are free to go to work, restaurants, and public places. But for the tens of thousands of people in Taiwan who are under quarantine, the government is “geofencing” them in their homes by tracking their cellphone signals and using police enforcement. China has a similar approach: If your QR health code is red, you have to stay put in your home.

But no system is absolutely effective, and it’s plausible to see a world where the US adapts certain parts of different countries’ strategies to use technology to reopen the economy.

New technology will only help if it’s complemented by sound policy and swift leadership, two things President Trump’s administration has botched, with disastrous consequences. Successfully using new technology will also require open-mindedness and cooperation between the private and public sectors — without violating people’s basic rights to privacy.

And it’s not just the US that faces this challenge. Places outside Asia, such as the UK, Australia, and Iceland, are all considering using similar digital contact-tracing tools, and they face the same policy challenges. It’s an unprecedented task for an unprecedented time — but taking into consideration what other countries’ methods are working well, and with what consequences, can help US leaders better understand how to create a system that may work for everyone.

Update, April 22, 2020, 3:40pm: This post has been updated to include information about a second wave of cases in Singapore.

"['Peter Kafka', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,"Coronavirus pandemic, Tiger King give Netflix record subscriber numbers","What happens when a pandemic forces most of the world to stay home?

They watch Netflix.

And if they don’t have Netflix, they sign up for Netflix.

That’s why Netflix added more subscribers during the coronavirus pandemic than during any other quarter in its history. In its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday, the streaming video company said it now has 183 million customers around the world and that its leap in subscribers was driven entirely by the worldwide lockdown.

The question is what that behavior means for Netflix and for other companies around the world during an economic crisis.

It’s not surprising that Netflix saw a surge in viewing, because people don’t have to step outside their shelters to test that theory — you either watched Tiger King, like 64 million other people, or you knew that lots of other people watched the true crime series about deeply weird tiger fans.

Much more important is the sneak peek Netflix provides of the test all consumer companies will be facing for the next couple of years: In a ravaged economy — in the last four weeks, 22 million people have filed for unemployment in the US alone — are we selling something people will buy?

Like everything else about the pandemic, anyone who tells you they know a definitive answer is almost certainly lying.

“We don’t use the terms “guess” and “guesswork” lightly,” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said during his company’s conference call. “We use them because it’s a bunch of us feeling the wind.”

For now, Netflix has something millions of people want to buy. On January 21, when much of the world still hadn’t realized the threat the coronavirus posed, the company told Wall Street it expected to add 7 million new subscribers in the first three months of 2020. Instead, it added nearly 16 million, and all of that unexpected growth came in March, when governments around the world told their citizens to stay home.

In a letter to investors, Hastings says he thinks the company could add another 7.5 million subscribers next quarter. But, again, he doesn’t really know: “The actual Q2 numbers could end up well below or well above that, depending on many factors including when people can go back to their social lives in various countries and how much people take a break from television after the lockdown.”

Hastings also figures that some of the customers he signed up in March would have signed up later in the year, which means that the company’s numbers in the summer and fall might be lower than what he projected before.

It remains to be seen how other companies will describe consumer behavior over the next few weeks as they provide their own updates. Hundreds of them have already told Wall Street that they don’t have any idea about what to expect.

Netflix may well prove to be one of the few companies that is booming during the pandemic because it is different from many other consumer-facing businesses: It’s an internet-only business that hasn’t had to interrupt its service in any way, and it’s a subscription-based business that doesn’t make any money from advertising so it doesn’t have to worry about the collapse of that industry.

Netflix is also, for now, in a good position to ride out the pandemic: While it has billions in debt, it is generating lots of cash each month from its subscribers.

It is already using some of that money to buy stuff from other media companies whose businesses have been disrupted by the coronavirus: On Tuesday, it announced that it had bought Enola Holmes, an adventure movie that AT&T’s Warner Bros had planned on showing in theaters; it had already bought Lovebirds, a movie that Paramount was supposed to show in theaters earlier this year but had to shelve.

Netflix had been preparing to spend the year talking about competition from new streaming services like Disney+ and Quibi, and upcoming ones like HBO Max and Peacock. Now, Wall Street is more worried that Netflix will at some point run out of stuff to show its subscribers.

That could be a real issue for Netflix, since like every other TV network and movie studio, it has had to stop production on almost all of the stuff it had in the works. (There are some exceptions: Netflix has animators working at home on some projects. Some shows and movies, like a new season of The Crown, have already finished filming, and Netflix thinks it can continue post-production work on those remotely, too. The company also said on Tuesday that it has actually resumed production in South Korea and Iceland.)

Hastings thinks Netflix has more stuff in its library than his competitors in the streaming world, so he’ll be better off regardless.

But he doesn’t know: “Since we have a large library with thousands of titles for viewing and very strong recommendations, our member satisfaction may be less impacted than our peers’ by a shortage of new content,” he wrote. “But it will take time to tell.”

"['Lois Parshley', 'Apr']",2020-04-28,Where the coronavirus is hitting rural America hard,"New York City is still battling America’s worst Covid-19 outbreak to date. And now, even as some states begin to consider reopening, many sparsely populated areas of rural America are seeing a worrying uptick in cases.

“The epicenter of this outbreak really has shifted into the smaller rural areas,” said Angela Hewlett, associate professor in infectious disease at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in a recent Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing. And that’s a major problem, given that the health systems of many of these places are the least equipped to deal with a sudden surge in cases.

Testing in many less-populous areas has lagged even further behind the already-low national average, obscuring the extent of transmission in more sparsely populated areas. As protests in largely rural states show, some people assume rural areas might be spared the worst of Covid-19 outbreaks.

Yet many people in rural regions work in large-scale industries, such as food processing, where social distancing is challenging and they’re at higher risk. “Part of the reason that we’re seeing such dramatic increases in rural communities” is because the virus is running rampant through workplaces like factories and farms, says Hewlett.

“These are not places where typically people can work from home,” she notes. Instead, “there are often lots of people working in very close contact in these essential jobs — which really is a setup for perpetuating a disease like this.”

This deadly combination will lead to longer, more sustained outbreaks in rural regions, “making reopening much more challenging,” Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah School of Medicine, said at the IDSA briefing. “I think we’ve oversimplified this idea of peaks. We’re not seeing one epidemic nationwide, or even statewide — we’re seeing different outbreaks, thousands of them playing out in different parts of the country.”

What counts as “rural America”— and how much is the virus spreading there?

Rural can mean many things. The US census definition, for example, is any spot with a population of fewer than 50,000 people. But depending on what federal definition you use, some 17 percent to 49 percent of people in the US live in “rural” areas.

Additionally, otherwise-rural regions can have small and even fairly large metropolitan areas. According to a new Covid-19 map from the Dartmouth Atlas Project, the top 10 regions with the fastest growth rates in cases are primarily metropolitan areas with blue-collar industry, located in largely rural states.

Because they are small, many rural counties have few cases, giving the impression that broad regions of the country are still unaffected. A more accurate picture of what is happening with Covid-19 across the US emerges when the data are aggregated to larger geographic areas defined on where people get health care. “Both counties and states fail to reflect how and where people get care,” explains Elliott Fisher, a professor of health policy and medicine at the Dartmouth Institute.

“The epicenter of this outbreak really has shifted into the smaller rural areas”

Fisher and his colleagues’ maps show the current status of the Covid-19 epidemic through 306 US “hospital referral regions.” (They used data collected by the New York Times and the US census, and they will be updated every weekday.) In addition, unlike many of the maps which just show total case numbers, the Dartmouth Atlas Project shows population-based rates of the virus’s prevalence and the average growth rate.

Since hospital referral regions draw from multiple counties or even different states, Fisher hopes that the atlas may be able to provide “early signals about new outbreaks,” which may otherwise be missed.

For example, Houma, Louisiana, a town of around 32,000 people in the Atchafalaya Basin — live oak and Cajun country — has almost as many cases per capita within its hospital region as Chicago. Greeley, Colorado, where there is a large JBS meatpacking plant, has more cases per capita within its hospital region than Washington, DC.

That kind of case reporting is particularly critical given the ongoing shortage of testing. In areas of Utah, very few people are getting tested. “Does that mean there’s no disease? Absolutely not,” Pavia says. “It means we don’t have a good spotlight on what’s going on. And so we’re missing things.”

Testing scarcity is a reflection of the general unequal distribution of medical resources, which extends far beyond Covid-19. According to the Chartis Group, 63 percent of rural hospitals don’t have ICU beds. Many rural hospitals have only a month’s worth of cash on hand and have lost a substantial part of their income due to the reduction of outpatient services during the pandemic. This leaves them even less equipped to handle the crisis.

Most epidemiology models predict that initial peaks in less-densely populated states may still be weeks away, making understanding these kinds of nuances — and not relaxing social distancing prematurely — critical.

According to new federal guidelines, states should wait for a sustained decrease in cases over 14 days before easing restrictions. But these recommendations aren’t mandatory, and some states are behaving more cautiously than others — creating what Fisher terms a “natural experiment.”

Here’s a closer look at how communities in Central California, Alaska, South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Georgia are handling the uncertainty, and threat, of Covid-19.

Central California: “The fear and the unknown, and a lot of different information — all these create a monster”

Salinas, California, in Monterey County, is sometimes called the “Salad Bowl of the World.” Around 70 percent of the country’s lettuce — and a substantial amount of other produce — is grown here. As of April 28, the county had 185 confirmed cases, many of which were connected to the local farms. An employee at one of the largest local lettuce companies, Tanimura and Antle, for example, tested positive on April 22.

Health experts say more farmworkers around the country could be hit hard by the epidemic. “My fear is that once Covid-19 enters the farmworker population, it will be very difficult to prevent the spread, regardless of what is happening in the workplace,” Heather E. Riden, manager of the Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety at the University of California Davis, told Inside Climate News.

Many of the nearly 888,000 people in the US who harvest produce work in Central California. The US Department of Agriculture estimates that around half are undocumented immigrants, who have been excluded from the federal Covid-19 stimulus relief. The front line for the nation’s food supply, these jobs have been declared “essential,” but workers have had trouble accessing protective equipment like masks, and companies have been slow to institute measures that would enable social distancing. Masks in this environment are needed not just to prevent Covid-19; farmworkers are also regularly exposed to pesticides and chemicals.

As spring ramps up the growing season, farmers would normally be hiring additional workers, many of whom travel based on the season, adding another level of logistical difficulty and potential for disease spread.

California’s approximately 400,000 farmworkers are considered essential, but many, as immigrants, are exempt from the CARES package, nor do they have access to benefits like paid sick leave — or in some cases, even running water to regularly wash their hands. Some of those are at higher-risk work picking crops like strawberries, tomatoes, peaches, grapes, and apples.

“Strawberries and other harvesting like that, the workers are in rows, so that kind of forces people to be close by one another,” says Lauro Barajas, vice president of the labor union United Farm Workers, who previously worked on farms in California.

To add an additional hardship, H2A visas for foreign workers, like those strawberry season workers rely on, are also expected to be delayed due to the pandemic. Nor do many farms have much financial cushion if the season goes poorly; due to President Trump’s trade war, farm bankruptcies increased by 20 percent in 2019. In the 100 counties with the most farmworkers, $590 million in recent trade bailout payments were recently distributed without requiring improving conditions for farmworkers.

Barajas says, “The fear and the unknown, and a lot of different information — all these create a monster.” He notes that people working in agriculture are trying to protect themselves, but given their critical role in feeding the country, the government should do more. “Vegetables don’t grow in stores,” he says. “Farmworkers are always essential.”

Alaska: “Getting enough tests is a challenge”

When the sockeye salmon run arrives in Alaska’s Bristol Bay in May, the population of the small town of Dillingham usually triples. “Thousands of fishermen travel from 48 states to work in the fishery,” says Andy Wink, executive director of the Bristol Bay Regional Seafood Development Association.

But due to the high risk of imported coronavirus cases, the town of Dillingham, which has only 16 hospital beds, recently asked Gov. Mike Dunleavy to consider closing the season. “We cannot foresee ANY plan that would avoid a significant impact to our community,” wrote Mayor Alice Ruby in an open letter.

But the state of Alaska considers commercial fishing essential. Dillingham is now just one of many Alaskan towns bracing for an influx of travelers for commercial fishing — or a loss of the jobs that fuel the region’s economy. Gov. Dunleavy relaxed shelter-in-place restrictions on April 24, allowing restaurants, nail salons, and retail stores across the state to reopen. He has released state guidelines for commercial fishing vessels, requiring workers to self-quarantine for 14 days after arriving in Alaska, as well as screening before getting on a boat.

Even with statewide social distancing measures, the state’s daily case rate has still been almost doubling. While Alaska currently has some of the fewest confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country, it’s unclear how well the health care system — in a state where many towns can only be accessed by air or boat — will be able to cope with any kind of surge. The state’s chief medical officer has received a fraction of the supplies she’s requested, including inadequate numbers of personal protective equipment and test kits.

Wink says that even as the state reopens, “Getting enough tests is a challenge.” Seafood companies in Dillingham have been working with a regional small laboratory, Northwest Pathology, to increase testing availability for the fishing season. The lab can now analyze 10,000 tests a day, but its efforts have been hamstrung by a continued lack of critical supplies, like reagents, as well as the CDC seizing supply orders.

Given Alaska’s limited health resources, as industries like commercial fishing — and normally, tourism — potentially bring new infection sources into Alaska, there’s a critical need to be able to identify and control new outbreaks before reopening.

South Dakota and Missouri: “They dock you a point if you stay home sick”

Minnehaha County, South Dakota, became a Covid-19 hot spot when almost 1,000 people became sick at a Smithfield Foods plant, a major pork processing center. Even as Covid cases in the state rise, Republican Gov. Kristi Noem has so far resisted issuing a statewide stay-at-home order.

A Smithfield Foods spokesperson tried to blame the outbreak on “living circumstances in certain cultures” in an interview with Fox News. But a BuzzFeed investigation showed that the company “did little to inform or protect employees during the critical two weeks after the first case at the plant surfaced.” Less than a week later, families were organizing a drive-by tribute for people to pay their respects to a former Smithfield Foods employee who had died of Covid-19.

It’s not just South Dakota. Investigate Midwest reports that as of April 22, there have been at least 2,700 reported Covid cases tied to 60 meatpacking facilities in 23 states.

An anonymous employee at a Smithfield Foods plant in Missouri has filed a lawsuit on April 24, saying that on the line, workers can’t even cover their mouths to cough. David Muraskin, an attorney with Public Justice representing the case, says, “If you miss a piece of meat, you get fined,” so workers, sometimes literally inches from each other, can’t take appropriate precautions.

The CDC has guidelines for critical workers, which would include slowing production lines and spreading people out. “That is a possibility, but companies are not doing that,” Muraskin says.

Instead, as other plants have closed — and more than a dozen have this month — more meat is added to the lines to compensate. This makes conditions even worse. The employee filing the lawsuit knows of at least 11 people who have Covid-19 symptoms, but the company is not doing contact tracing.

People with symptoms are often not encouraged to stay home. At Smithfield, employees are not given sick leave. “They dock you a point if you stay home sick,” Muraskin says. “If you have nine points in a year, they can fire you.”

To make things worse, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has temporarily weakened enforcement mechanisms that might otherwise catch dangerous working conditions, leaving reporting violations up to employers.

As outbreaks balloon uncontrolled, some facilities have been forced to shut down. USA Today reports at least 17 facilities, including the JBS pork plant in Worthington, Minnesota, which produced 10 percent of the country’s pork, closed this week. “When you have a large outbreak associated with an industry like the meatpacking industry,” Hewlett says, “then you can have a sustained community transmission.” Politico reports that USDA meat inspectors have been told to buy their own masks because the department doesn’t have enough. So far, one inspector has died of Covid-19.

The outbreaks tied to meatpacking facilities and food processors have significant impacts beyond the community outbreaks they have sparked. As Covid-19 reduces processing capacity, hog farmers and chicken farms in other rural areas are considering euthanizing thousands of animals, with rippling effects in everything from long-haul trucking to grocery stores.

“Breakdowns in the food supply chain could have significant economic impacts for both consumers and agricultural producers,” 32 senators wrote in an open letter to Vice President Mike Pence. “It is also imperative that precautions are taken to ensure the stability and safety of our food supply.”

Nebraska: “We’re in the middle of a red state, so a lot of them believe this is like the flu”

On the Dartmouth Atlas Project tracker, some of the highest growth rates in cases are in western Nebraska. In addition to the meatpacking industries that employ many in this region, there are many other industries in Nebraska where people work in close contact, like nursing homes and correctional facilities.

Sue Krohn-Taylor is an administrator at a 72-apartment low-income senior living facility in the large town of Grand Island. She says her building is now on a self-imposed lockdown with restricted visiting rules and hours.

The facility is near a cluster of meatpacking cases and across the street from a hospital, so she says the quarantined senior residents count the Life Flight emergency helicopters coming and going. “We’re used to one to two a month, and geez, last weekend it was 13 or 15 in one day,” she says. Forty-six percent of the people tested in Krohn-Taylor’s county were positive for Covid-19.

Because there have been no state-sanctioned restrictions on facilities like hers, she’s been left in the uncomfortable position of setting the rules — and not all the residents appreciate it. “We’re in the middle of a red state, so a lot of them believe this is like the flu,” she says. “It’s a battle every day to get reality into focus.”

She also feels alone in the battle. “I’m 58 years old, and I have never felt so abandoned by my government,” Krohn-Taylor says. “Maybe I just lived in a bubble, but I always thought in times of crisis, as Americans we would never have to worry. Our government would take care of things.” Instead, she’s the one telling people to wear masks that some of the residents of the senior living facility stayed up all weekend making.

“I’m 58 years old, and I have never felt so abandoned by my government”

“Rural communities are all experiencing the same thing — a lack of resources,” says Jody Rutledge, who is deeply concerned for her mother, who is in a nursing home in Gordon, Nebraska. At least five nursing facilities in Nebraska now have confirmed cases of coronavirus, but testing and personal protective equipment like masks remain in short supply.

Krohn-Taylor says her daughter works for a correctional facility and is coughing and has lost her sense of taste. “They still want her to go to work,” she says. (Jails and prisons have also become epicenters for Covid-19.) But despite the risk of transmission, when her daughter went to the doctor, she wasn’t initially given a test, although she’s now scheduled for one, due in part to Krohn-Taylor’s urging.

“The lies are taking lives,” she says, “and that is not okay.”

Georgia: “No meal is worth dying for”

Due to two now-infamous funerals, the town of Albany, Georgia, has one of the highest growth rates of cases in the US. Rural Georgia was unprepared for the introduction of Covid-19: Nine counties in the state not only don’t have hospitals, but have no practicing doctors at all. Many residents have underlying health conditions, and a third of the population lives under the poverty line.

Nevertheless, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced April 21 that he too would reopen some businesses. Six other southern states with Republican governors have also announced they will be reopening, although not a time frame for when they will do so.

Around the country, the lack of federal mandates and unenforceable guidelines has left business owners to create their own standards for maintaining social distance. For example, the Georgia Board of Cosmetology and Barbers is suggesting barbers wear masks and disinfect shops, but there is no enforcement mechanism in place.

Hugh Acheson, a restaurateur in Athens, Georgia — a progressive university town near Atlanta — says even the state’s more metropolitan areas are bracing for the worst. As a chef, he wants step-by-step instructions on how to sanitize, and what social distancing really means before restaurants reopen. “No meal is worth dying for,” he says. A CBS poll found that 71 percent of Americans wouldn’t feel comfortable going to a bar or restaurant even if stay-at-home restrictions were lifted.

“The lies are taking lives and that is not okay”

Those numbers reflect the disconnect between many government responses and how people are feeling. In a poll of 1,200 rural Americans, Rural Organizing found that while approval of the federal response tended to fall along partisan lines, a majority of nonmetropolitan respondents said they didn’t believe Trump adequately prepared for the coronavirus outbreak, and 44 percent said they didn’t think the federal government had gone far enough to slow the spread of the outbreak. In the meantime, Attorney General William Barr has suggested that he may sue states in order to force reopening measures.

Across the US, Fisher says he’s worried about confusing messaging. “There’s been a major absence of federal leadership,” he says. “There is absolutely an essential federal role in managing this pandemic, from setting clear national policy guidance that doesn’t confuse people to managing and distributing resources.”

Federal health officials estimated in early April that more than 300,000 Americans could die from Covid-19 if social distancing measures are lifted. This may be a conservative estimate; some models suggest as many as 400,000 Americans may die from Covid-19 by June 1. Nor is it a safe assumption that many of these deaths will occur in cities.

Pavia suggests that this next phase of the pandemic won’t have a smooth curve so much as jagged crests and valleys, like the Wasatch mountains of his home state.

“When the valleys occur, we’re going to have to be very careful about how we try and return things toward a new normal.”

"['Rani Molla', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,Why Instagram’s co-founders made a site to track how fast the coronavirus is spreading,"Over the weekend, Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger launched rt.live, a website that calculates how fast the coronavirus is spreading in each state. This might seem like a surprising move for two people who became rich and famous for building a photo-sharing app. Then again, they also know a thing or two about metrics and algorithms.

While the numbers of cases and deaths are important metrics, these figures lag behind the present situation since it takes a while before symptoms show and people are tested. That’s why Systrom and Krieger zeroed in on a different metric: the effective reproduction rate (Rt) of Covid-19. Their new site presents this Rt metric in a series of charts showing how the spread of coronavirus in the United States shifts over time.

You might be more familiar with the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the number of infections caused by a single infection of a given disease. Rt, which is sometimes referred to as Re, uses statistical adjustments to create a more real-time and dynamic estimate of how fast the disease is spreading. Plotted out over the past few weeks, the Rt metrics of every state in the country can show the spread of the novel coronavirus being affected by government actions like stay-at-home measures.

“I was thinking about the metric I’d need to make decisions during times of uncertainty and this seemed like the right fit,” Systrom told Recode.

An Rt value of one means each case causes one new case, on average. If the value is less than one, the spread of the disease is slowing and will likely peter out over time. A value higher than one means it will spread to more and more of the population, so the higher the value, the worse the spread.

Even a quick glance at the Rt values shows stark differences across the United States. As of April 20, Nebraska had the highest effective reproduction rate of any state with each individual leading to an average of two secondary cases. Idaho had the lowest Rt at 0.2.

Another view of the same chart highlights states that do not have shelter-in-place orders. Four of the five states without those orders — Nebraska, North Dakota, Iowa, and Arkansas — have high effective reproduction rates, suggesting the virus spreads more quickly in areas where shelter-in-place orders don’t exist.

As the state-by-state charts below make clear, the effective reproduction rate fluctuates over time. These fluctuations reflect how different behaviors combined with the disease’s inherent characteristics can slow the spread of Covid-19 — or speed up the outbreak.

In New York, for example, the Rt has been declining since March 22, when the state issued a stay-at-home order. In the last couple of weeks, it has been below one, and if that Rt value holds the disease could die out there over time.

The situation is much different in Nebraska and Iowa, where there is no stay-at-home mandate. The Rt value in those two states has been consistently above one, meaning that the disease is likely to keep spreading. Generally speaking, states that have enacted strict measures against the spread of coronavirus are showing the Rt trending downward, and those without those orders are fluctuating more sporadically.

These graphs tell a different story than even advanced state-by-state breakdowns of Covid-19 cases. And echoing Systrom’s own statements, epidemiological experts are also in favor of better metrics to fight the pandemic.

“Policy must not be determined based on the daily count of reported cases ­— the tallies you read about constantly in the news — because those are unreliable,” Gabriel Leung, an infectious disease epidemiologist and dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, wrote in the New York Times earlier this month. “What’s needed instead is the coronavirus’s real-time, effective reproduction number, or its actual ability to spread at a particular time.”

Natalie E. Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, said in an interview that Systrom and Krieger’s model, as well as the data behind it, seems sound. (The Rt on Systrom and Krieger’s site is calculated using a moving average of new case data from the nonprofit Covid Tracking Project and by applying a modified formula created by scientists Luís M. A. Bettencourt and Ruy M. Ribeiro.) Tracking the effective reproductive rate of the virus, she added, is a reasonable way to look at how well states’ intervention strategies are working. However, Dean warns that, on its own, a low Rt is not a good reason to end shelter-in-place measures.

“If people are using it for permission to open things back up, it’s not the full story because there are other considerations, like what systems do you have in place to prevent this from shooting back up again,” Dean said. “If you just open everything back up but are not testing widely, isolating cases, and contact tracing, it’s just going to shoot back up.”

Nevertheless, it’s not yet clear how Systrom and Krieger’s site will factor in to public health decisions. The site cites some known issues with the data, including how quick ramp-ups or declines in testing could affect the numbers. There’s also the delay between when someone is infected and when they begin exhibiting symptoms and get tested. Other issues include low testing levels in some states as well as the fact that many people are asymptomatic and may never get tested. If a testing level hits a ceiling, for example, Dean said it could show the same number of new cases per day and the same Rt even if cases are growing rapidly.

Systrom, for one, seems committed to spending time helping solve pandemic-related problems. The Instagram co-founder has already written a series of blog posts about the coronavirus response, including one called “The Metric We Need to Manage COVID-19” that preceded the launch of rt.live. He’s also conversing with scientists and statisticians — as well as people on Twitter — about how to improve it and what features to add.

“Without the use of a clear metric on our ability to contain the coronavirus pandemic, it’s difficult to imagine that we’ll manage a return to normalcy anytime soon,” Systrom said in his latest post. “I hope by sharing this work with you, you will consider Rt as the metric that can guide our analysis and decision-making.”

For Systrom, the project is currently “full time in the sense that we’re all in lockdown and I’m not working on any other major projects at the moment, but I don’t intend on it being a job.” He added, “Think of it as a collaboration between me and Mike.”

"['Rebecca Heilweil', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,What happens when you go coronavirus viral,"As the coronavirus pandemic stretches from spring into summer, social media has become an essential part of keeping in touch. So it’s no surprise that those who have tested positive for Covid-19 are turning to platforms like Facebook and Instagram to update their friends, detail their symptoms, and express their anxieties. And some of these posts are turning everyday internet users into online celebrities, if only for a moment.

Covid-19 survivors are going viral and finding legions of well-wishers rooting for their recovery. Some of their stories are even getting picked up by national and international media. Twitter, in particular, has become a launching pad for coronavirus stories to go viral, as threads of tweets are easily elevated by trending hashtags and widely shared through retweets from celebrities.

But with internet fame comes unexpected scrutiny and even harassment. Trolls are calling these survivors “crisis actors,” and total strangers are inundating them with personal questions about their medical histories. One Wisconsin high school student was even threatened with jail time by a sheriff after posting about her Covid-19 symptoms on Instagram, according to a lawsuit she filed.

Ending up in the spotlight surely isn’t everyone’s goal. Many share their coronavirus experiences online to warn others to take the virus more seriously or to push back against popular misconceptions, like the idea that young people can’t get seriously ill from the novel coronavirus. We spoke to three such people — a prominent legal recruiter, a medical school professor, and a college student — about what it’s like to go viral for having Covid-19. Here’s what happened to them.

David Lat, legal recruiter

Before falling ill with the novel coronavirus, David Lat mostly posted about topics like the Democratic presidential race and the Supreme Court. As a legal recruiter and founder of the popular blog Above the Law, Lat was well-known in the legal industry, and the lion’s share of his followers on Twitter has historically been lawyers and law students.

When the novel coronavirus first hit the United States, Lat remarked on the outbreak as an observer. One blog post he published at the beginning of March wondered what an economic downturn exacerbated by a pandemic would mean for major law firms, hypothesizing about layoffs and the implications of a recession. He also shared a few tweets about how the coronavirus could change society and politics.

But then, on March 17, Lat announced in a series of tweets that he himself had tested positive. The thread criticized the “ridiculous efforts” that getting a test required and offered an apology to those he might have infected. The same day, Lat revealed in another thread that he had been hospitalized and said, “I’m a generally healthy, 44-year-old male, 153 lbs. (surely less now), 5’7”, no drugs, rarely drink, no health conditions other than exercise-induced asthma.” He started the hashtag #LatsCovid19Journal and promised updates.

People rallied to support Lat. They included a slew of celebrities, like actor Patricia Arquette and Rent star Anthony Rapp. Even Cher tweeted in response to Lat’s thread about being hospitalized, which has garnered nearly 40,000 “Likes” and thousands of retweets. That was “awesome,” Lat later told Recode.

Babe…So So Sorry.I Hope

You’re Not In Pain & KNOW YOU’LL BE UP & HEALTHY SOON

I’m a Little Nervous,

1. Im almost 100

2.Have Had Many Bronchitis,

3.Pneumonia,

4.& Asthma — Cher (@cher) March 18, 2020

The day after his first big viral thread, Lat continued to tweet about symptoms, urging officials to conduct more testing.

“I wanted to alert anyone who had come into contact with me that I had it, which could help them get tested in the event that they came down with symptoms,” Lat said in an email. “I got such a strong response to those initial posts on Twitter and Facebook that I decided to keep on posting. I realized that people were hungry for information about this new and frightening virus.”

After tweeting often on March 18, Lat’s account fell silent. Unknown to his followers, he’d been hooked up to a ventilator and could not tweet. Nevertheless, strangers continued to come across his case online and began to update one another on how he was doing. Even comedian Kathy Griffin chimed in (she’d been dealing with Covid-19 concerns of her own). While Lat was intubated, his followers cross-referenced social media posts from family members and pointed one another to legal blogs documenting how he was doing. Fake news sites in the Philippines falsely reported that he had died, Lat later said.

Ten days later, Lat tweeted once again, announcing that he’d returned to breathing on his own and had been transferred out of intensive care. Susan Rice, the former US National Security Advisor, tweeted “Great News!!” Patricia Arquette said in a tweet, “I was freaking out. Days seemed to go by with no post.” One non-celebrity Twitter user replied, “Haha don’t even know you and have literally worried about you daily for the past two weeks.” Someone replied to that tweet, “David kept popping into my head at random times day & night - even snuck into my dreams one night.”

Now that it’s been over a month since his hospitalization, Lat says he’s recovering, though still not back to his normal self. That hasn’t stopped him from continuing to share his Covid-19 experience. He’s written an op-ed for the Washington Post and spoken on segments on networks like MSNBC and CBS. He asked to speak with Recode over email because he was so exhausted from doing interviews with the media, and his voice is still “shot” from the ventilator.

“I did feel an obligation to update people on what had happened to me — partly because I knew, both from social media and from private messages sent to me, that people were worried,” Lat says. “I wanted people, including strangers following my case, to know that I was off the ventilator and recovering.”

Lat now refers to himself as a “Survivor” of Covid-19 on his Twitter bio. Since first posting about contracting the novel coronavirus, Lat says his follower count has grown from about 33,000 to nearly 96,000.

“It’s possible that with time, I’ll just go back to being my old self — and I certainly hope that’s the case when it comes to physical things, like my lungs and my (still-hoarse) voice,” he told Recode. “But when it comes to my emotions, I hope I always harbor at least some of the positive and thankful feelings I feel right now.”

Noopur Raje, doctor and medical professor

Noopur Raje says she normally doesn’t post much about her personal life online. As a specialist in a type of cancer that shows up in plasma cells, she works as both a professor at Harvard’s Medical School and a doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital. Raje’s tweets are limited to comments on medical conferences, cancer research, and, occasionally, social issues.

But Raje decided to post something more personal after she and her husband, who is also a doctor, both became infected with the novel coronavirus.

1/I never tweet about personal issues—but this is way too important—I am COVID positive and asymptomatic and have been a caregiver for my husband @JagSinghMD who was critically ill with #COVID19. I've learned some things - please follow for more 1/25 — Noopur Raje (@NoopurRajeMD) April 5, 2020

Singh, a cardiologist who also teaches at Harvard, had become critically ill, battling fever, exhaustion, chills, weight loss, and fatigue. Raje relayed that she had ultimately called 911, and her husband was admitted to intensive care, where he’d given his consent for intubation, should it be necessary.

While her husband had fallen gravely ill, Raje wanted people to know that both of them tested positive and that she was completely asymptomatic. Her tweet has gotten over 17,500 “Likes,” making it her most popular tweet by far. People also came to her thread to ask questions about the virus’s symptoms and wanting to know what doctors with Covid-19 had to say about the illness.

“The response has been unbelievable. I did not expect this, but it just underscores the fact that people are so hungry to find out,” Raje told Recode. “The other thing, I think, is that people are not comfortable sharing. It’s almost like, if you say you’re Covid positive, in my line of work, it’s not easy to say that. You feel like you’re going to be looked at.”

Singh has since improved, though he’s still coughing and has some shortness of breath. The couple is now spreading the word, doing appearances on local media and continuing to call for widespread testing. On social media, they tag-team when answering people’s coronavirus questions, including those about their own vaccination statuses. Raje has also been outspoken about social distancing, since some cases can be asymptomatic like hers.

“We’re both physicians and have access to the world’s best health care system. And yet, there were so many unknowns in this whole process, and I learned so much that I felt it really important to share,” Raje tells Recode. “We as physicians — with an understanding of pathology and physiology — had such a hard time navigating this largely because of lack of knowing how this is going to evolve.”

Amy Shircel, college student

On Twitter, Amy Shircel, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, calls herself a “gorgeous leftist” and a “big fan of Clif bars,” among other things. Her tweets in the early part of this year largely focused on Bernie Sanders, veganism, and college life. Then, after a spring break trip to Portugal was cut comically short due to the travel ban on Europe, Shircel started to feel sick, and the topic of her tweets took a dramatic turn.

I have been waiting 58 hours to hear back about the results of my covid-19 test. I’m sick as hell. Why are celebrities getting their tests back in a day? Huh???? Somethings gotta give — Amy (@AmyShircel) March 19, 2020

The test came back positive. Two trips to the emergency room later, Shircel returned to Twitter to warn other young people that they, too, should take Covid-19 seriously.

I’m 22 and I tested positive for COVID-19. Take it from me - you do NOT want to catch this



Hopefully hearing about my experience will help the rest of you to stay home (for real) — Amy (@AmyShircel) March 28, 2020

The above tweet ended up garnering nearly 300,000 “Likes” and over 100,000 retweets. The threaded tweets describing Shircel’s symptoms and experience with Covid-19 got tens of thousands more “Likes” and retweets. As her thread attracted more attention, Shircel did a slew of media appearances for her college’s student paper, ABC, Cosmopolitan, and the Dr. Phil Show.

But it wasn’t all positive coverage. Some outlets, to her discomfort, highlighted what Shircel calls the “kind of gross” aspects of her illness. For instance, British tabloid the Daily Mail ran with the headline: “‘I was afraid I would die’: Woman, 22, describes how coronavirus left her crawling to the bathroom to vomit, struggling for breath and lying in a pool of her own sweat.”

Then there was the ugliness and invasiveness of the internet.

“People are weird on the internet and people feel entitled to ask you things,” Shircel told Recode. “People were asking me, like, what is my blood type? What is my medical history like? I didn’t have my DMs open on Twitter, but I had them open on Instagram and I was just getting hundreds of DMs, like, do you vape? Do you smoke? Do you have this condition?”

Shircel was also accused of politicizing the crisis. At the end of her first thread, she tweeted in support of Bernie Sanders and Medicare-for-all. She says she was even accused of being a “crisis actor,” a term that’s often used by conspiracy theorists, among a wide range of threatening and negative comments. Recode reviewed screenshots that Shircel took of some of the negative comments she received, which included people doubting her illness, insulting her intelligence, and peppering her with profanities.

“I was getting DMs telling me to die, that they wished I died, that I deserved to die. That I was ugly, that I was fat,” Shircel said.

Shircel says she was accused of tweeting for attention, in part because she sometimes tags the New York Times in threads.

“I think I was misunderstood in my intentions with that,” she said, “but I wanted my story to reach the New York Times. I think it would be a huge platform.”

The Times has not reached out to Shircel.

Still, Shircel says she’s feeling much better. Now, she has nearly 7,000 followers on Twitter, almost all of whom came to her account after she started tweeting about her experience with Covid-19.

Although she still tweets about having had the coronavirus, Shircel also returned to other, more mundane topics. Sometimes, she writes about wanting a boyfriend or naming a new kitten after Bernie Sanders. But now, more people comment than ever before, many of them complete strangers.

“I gained such a large following. I kind of have, like, a small platform now. And, it’s just like guys hitting on me on the internet — after this — like I’ve never experienced before,” Shircel told Recode.

Shircel says she has no regrets about posting about her Covid-19 diagnosis because her message was so important, though she does have one bit of advice: “Ignore all of the random people. Maybe close your Instagram DMs before things go viral or too crazy.”

"['Kelsey Piper', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-21,This new charity offers scientists coronavirus grants in 48 hours,"It takes a really long time to get a grant for scientific research. Official advice from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the largest source of grants for science research in the US, recommends that grant planning begin nine months in advance of the deadline for the grant. Time surveys suggest that top researchers may spend as much as half their time writing grant applications.

That’s an inefficient system in the best of times. During a crisis like the current one, when researchers in critical biology, medicine, and epidemiology want to attempt to answer pressing questions immediately, it’s disastrous.

That’s why, two weeks ago, Patrick Collison, the CEO of the payments company Stripe, and Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, launched Fast Grants. The concept is this: Scientists can submit an application for a grant in 30 minutes or less and get a response within two days. They can request between $10,000 and $500,000. The initial money was put up by some of Silicon Valley’s biggest names, including Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Y Combinator founder Paul Graham, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.

The response was as you might expect: Fast Grants was immediately swamped by applications. After less than a week, the group stopped all applications, having granted all $12 million they initially had available. They may reopen applications if they secure more funding to distribute.

Fast Grants are now funding a whole range of projects: vaccine development at Kyoto University; a University of Toronto study to validate a saliva test for the novel coronavirus; a project at UC Berkeley to conduct a randomized study of spread and infection rates in the Bay Area; research at Vancouver General Hospital to study heart injury in Covid-19 patients; a study at Stanford University to develop better point-of-care tests; and 62 others.

This sort of approach — giving out lots of money, very fast, with a very streamlined process for understanding what makes a grant opportunity valuable — is called rapid-response grant making. It can be a great way to put money in the hands of those who need it fast and without bureaucracy. It also raises some bigger questions about the world’s coronavirus response and about the whole way we do science. Grant making, in general, happens slowly. That’s true of grants from foundations for philanthropy and grants from the government for basic research. The months-long process of securing funding absorbs the time and attention of people whose work is sorely needed. Faster grants could be better for everyone.

There are trade-offs to compressing a months-long project into a matter of hours. Each grant can’t get in-depth review, and promising ideas will inarguably be overlooked. So far, because of the overwhelming demand, less than 1 percent of grants were funded, which is a much worse rate than in typical grant making. (The team is at work securing more funding to offer some of the most promising projects that were left out.)

But despite those problems, there’s reason to believe that fast grant making beats slow grant making — and not just when we’re in the middle of an emergency. A process with quick turnaround is much more respectful of everyone’s time and ultimately healthier for science and for society. “Fast Grants is about restoring our capacity to respond to emergencies, and I believe the future will show that we will need this capacity time and again,” Cowen told me.

How Fast Grants makes grants

To be eligible for a Fast Grant, you have to be a principal investigator at an “academic institution” already at work on a project that could help in the next six months with the Covid-19 pandemic and in need of additional funding to complete it. When you submit a proposal, it’s assigned to a volunteer reviewer from a team of 20 academic experts led by Stanford biochemistry professor Silvana Konermann. The application, she told me, was “designed to take maybe 30 minutes, maybe up to an hour” for scientists, because “the people who are really busy working on Covid, they don’t have time right now to be working on grants.”

You do not need to work in the United States, and many grants have been made to researchers in other countries.

Fast Grants promised that your part of the application — where you explained the research that you were conducting — should take around 30 minutes. They then promised that their part — reviewing the grants and offering money to the most promising ones — would take less than two days (except for the very first grants, which were not made for five days so that the team of specialists reviewing the grants would have time to get a sense of how strong the average application was).

That’s a dramatic change from how most research grant making works. It takes months to prepare an application for an NIH grant. It used to be the case that more than 50 percent of NIH grant applications were approved, but research has grown and the pool of grant money hasn’t, so now it’s only about 20 percent. That means researchers have to apply to lots and lots of potential grant sources if they want to keep their projects funded. Grant applications fill a quarter to a half of a scientist’s working hours.

But there is historical precedent for the Fast Grants model. During World War II, the US created the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), whose job was to fund research and development for weapons we’d use in warfare. By most criteria, it was an astonishing success: It funded the research that became critical wartime tools like radar, as well as early research into the atomic bomb.

And the NDRC made grants practically overnight. The Fast Grants website, which cites the NDRC as an inspiration, quotes a memoir by Vannevar Bush, who led the program at the time. “Within a week NDRC could review the project,” he wrote. “The next day the director could authorize, the business office could send out a letter of intent, and the actual work could start.”

Why the obsession with speed? When it comes to the coronavirus, days matter. Epidemiologists have suggested that if we’d started social distancing just a few weeks earlier, tens of thousands of deaths could have been averted. And helping an effective test, treatment, or vaccine get developed faster could mean reopening the economy sooner — which will mean millions more Americans have jobs, food, and material security. Getting money out to scientists as fast as possible is always a matter of life or death, but right now the stakes are higher than ever.

Skeptics of rapid-response grant making argue that cutting down the approval process typically means that reviewers are forced to rely on vague signals of research quality instead of deeply digging into the relevant medicine and evaluating projects on their merits. They might, for example, approve all applications from prestigious researchers or universities, excluding important research done by a less-established researcher.

There’s some merit to this criticism, but it misses an important point: Standard grant making also has this problem, despite the months-long delays in the process at various points. In fact, studies show that above some threshold of grant quality, there is virtually no agreement among reviewers about which projects are the best ones. There’s also almost no correlation between how projects “scored” and how often the research that resulted from the projects was cited.

That suggests that lots of review time is effectively wasted. Sorting the “pretty good” projects from the bad ones is worthwhile, but after that, even spending a lot of time doesn’t result in funding the best of the best. That makes research grants uniquely well-suited for a fast grant-making program that, in an emergency like this one, should just fund everything above a basic quality threshold instead of trying to tease out which projects are best.

Fast Grants had a team of 20 researchers to review the applications, and each application they accepted was looked over by at least three of them. “It was very much rigorous peer review, it was just accelerated,” Konermann told me.

They tried to fund a range of projects. “This is a new virus, and we don’t know what is going to work,” Konermann said. “Drug development, vaccine development, very clinical work, some basic virology, understanding the immune responses and whether people become resistant ... because we’re funding such a variety of approaches, the chances that at least one of them is going to meaningfully help is really good.”

Why did we need Fast Grants?

It’s great that a small group of people were able to set up and execute a project like this, distributing $12 million in two weeks to promising coronavirus projects. (Stripe provided software for the applicants and for the reviewers, Konermann’s team did the reviewing, and Tyler Cowen at Emergent Ventures, Mercatus Center, made the final decisions to distribute the money.)

It’s also deeply frustrating that they needed to. If there are thousands of projects to help with the coronavirus in progress at established research universities, many of them positioned to deliver results in the next six months, why does it take a few private philanthropists to get them the money they need? The $2 trillion US stimulus contained little money for scientific research, even though spending more on this kind of work earlier might have meant not needing to spend as much on getting businesses and consumers through a major economic downturn. Why weren’t we faster to get scientists the money for coronavirus research?

And why is scientific grant funding so slow the rest of the time?

I’ve written before about how, in the absence of a strong response from the US government, philanthropists are saving lives by taking on the responsibilities that the government should have handled. I think Fast Grants is yet another example of that.

And we should be frustrated that we needed such a project. “The NIH and the NSF have also started programs that are a lot faster than their normal processes, but those are generally just starting now,” Konermann told me. “They haven’t gone into effect as much for basic research. It was clear to me from talking to some colleagues that many of them hadn’t gotten funding yet, even though they were working on Covid.”

No scientist whose work might produce a vaccine, a treatment, or a better test should be spending weeks on grant applications or waiting weeks for answers. The government could still step in on this front.

Fast Grants ended up funding only a tiny fraction of the project proposals they got, even though Collison told me that the “median application was super strong.” In just one week, they were flooded with more than 4,000 proposals, and they spent the $12 million allocated for the project very quickly, with 67 awards made.

Rapid-response grant making shouldn’t just be for emergencies

The coronavirus crisis highlights a system that was broken long before the coronavirus crisis began.

When it takes nine months of work to apply for an NIH grant and months more to hear back about whether you received it, when scientists at the peak of their careers are spending half their time writing grant applications, that waste and delay cost us lives even when there’s no coronavirus. It means that new cancer treatments take longer to be discovered and tested. It means that bad ideas can’t be rejected quickly and good ideas can’t be published quickly.

The crisis we’re in might also present us with an opportunity to fix a broken system. If 30-minute grant applications really give reviewers enough information to identify promising ideas, and if it’s possible for reviewers to get back to grant applicants within two days, that isn’t just something we should be doing for the duration of the crisis. It’s also the direction we should be moving research toward in general.

“I think there is space for additional mechanisms that could be faster, shorter, take less time,” Konermann told me. “This was a bit of an experiment to see if that was possible at all. It ended up working better even than I had hoped. It would be nice to have a diversity of funding mechanisms.” Scientists could have more flexibility in pursuing projects and hopefully spend more of their time doing science.

“I don’t think all scientific grant making should operate on this basis. But probably 5 or 10 percent should or maybe more. Currently just about zero percent of the system uses such a speedy yet rigorous method, and when a fast-moving problem such as Covid-19 arises, we are caught unready,” Cowen told me.

And even if the government does not make any such changes, there are some important lessons here for philanthropists. Responding quickly to grant applicants has a lot of benefits. It means you don’t waste the time of potential recipients, and projects don’t spend months lingering in limbo.

It is possible to get things done much faster than we’re accustomed to, and that’s a lesson we can hopefully carry with us long past the end of the current crisis.

"['Shirin Ghaffary', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-20,"Facebook is taking down some, but not all, quarantine protest event pages","Facebook is taking down some event pages promoting controversial anti-stay-at-home protests that are taking place across the US — but it’s only doing this in areas where the events violate local Covid-19 social distancing rules. Facebook’s selective response mirrors a larger fracture across the country as the Trump administration has given conflicting guidance about how and when restrictions should be lifted and has largely left these decisions up to individual state politicians.

The move comes after Facebook faced criticism for allowing people to coordinate anti-quarantine protests on its platform. Public health officials, state officials, and health care workers say these protests are putting people’s lives at risk: By bringing people together in large crowds, they increase the chances of spreading the highly contagious disease. Others, including President Trump, have defended the protests, saying in a press conference on Monday that the protesters “love our country” and “want to get back to work.” Facebook’s decision to take down these posts comes at a time when the company is trying to step up as a leader in using big data to battle the virus’s spread while also battling efforts by some of its users to spread Covid-19 misinformation.

Facebook confirmed to Recode that it will take down some posts organizing protests in areas where the events go against local law — and for now, it’s only done so in California, New Jersey, and Nebraska. In other states, such as Pennsylvania, users are continuing to promote anti-quarantine protests on Facebook, with as many as 60,000 members in one Pennsylvania group alone. In response to questions from Recode about why Facebook took down some posts but not others and concerns raised about them doing so, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone sent the following statement:

“Unless government prohibits the event during this time, we allow it to be organized on Facebook. For this same reason, events that defy government’s guidance on social distancing aren’t allowed on Facebook.”

The governors’ offices of New Jersey and Nebraska told Fox News and CNN that they had been in touch with Facebook about social distancing, but that they did not ask Facebook to take down the events.

In recent weeks, a small number of people across the US have taken to the streets to protest Covid-19 shelter-in-place orders, arguing that people should be allowed to return to work and resume normal life, despite the risks to public health in doing so. Millions of Americans are facing economic hardships after an unprecedented shutdown of public life and nonessential businesses. While polls show that a majority of Americans across party lines are afraid of prematurely ending social distancing, these protests are spreading across states. So far, anti-quarantine protesters number in the thousands, but they are a vocal minority.

These protests have been organized and gained publicity via Facebook’s events feature. While many of them appear to be organic posts started by concerned locals, reports by the Guardian and the Washington Post have revealed that many of them were actually started by established right-wing and pro-gun political groups.

In photographs and videos of these protests, many people are standing closer than 6 feet apart and without masks covering their faces, which poses a known public health risk to themselves and others. In one anti-lockdown protest in Colorado, local health care workers clashed with protesters, standing in front of them in their medical scrubs and protective gear.

Protest participants have argued they have a constitutional right to assemble. That’s one of the reasons why nonpartisan policy experts have raised concerns about precedents Facebook could set in shutting down efforts to organize these protests on its platform.

Facebook has historically been a powerful platform for organizing protests in the US and elsewhere, from Black Lives Matter actions to the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right Rally — a violent white supremacist gathering that resulted in one murder and several injuries. (Facebook eventually took down the main event page a day before the rally took place.)

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly defended the company’s role in protecting free speech on its platform, particularly around politics. Many are arguing that the anti-quarantine protests should fall under that protection and that people’s civil liberties are at risk if Facebook shuts down such events.

But others say that while individual rights to protest are at stake, so is the health of the public.

“The problem isn’t civil liberties because these groups can build their own webpages and carry out conversation there,” Joan Donovan, the director of Harvard University’s Technology and Social Change Research Project, told Recode. “The overarching question is, ‘does Facebook have a responsibility to protect their users from health misinformation?’ If you think they should, then these actions are the correct course of action.”

"['Theodore Schleifer', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-20,Silicon Valley’s favorite charity is asking its donors to give away hundreds of millions of dollars. Right now.,"Silicon Valley billionaires have amassed an astounding amount of power and money over the past few years — even though they’ve pledged to give away their fortunes. That dual reality has been aided by a new type of charitable giving that allows the wealthy to park their money in tax-advantaged philanthropies but then disburse it very slowly, allowing them to keep a firm grip on the assets.

No organization has epitomized this more, in the eyes of its critics, than the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which you might not have heard of but is the most important charity for tech’s elite. Critics have spent years casting it as a sycophantic enabler of tax avoiders that has allowed billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Reed Hastings, and Sergey Brin to collect generous tax breaks while stowing their unprecedented war chests at its headquarters, indefinitely.

But amid a historic pandemic, the foundation has quietly started to do something unusual: It’s asking its donors to give hundreds of millions of dollars, right now, to deal with the local consequences of the coronavirus.

On private phone calls over the past few weeks, the group has urged its donors to immediately give up to 5 percent of their assets to this cause. The push violates the typical power dynamics in the world of big-money philanthropy, where often-obsequious advisers gingerly manage relationships with some of the world’s richest people. That the foundation needs to set such an expectation, even a modest one, is revealing of how slow some of the megarich have been to actually donate their money, and how the pandemic might begin to change that.

“The money’s already there to give. So let’s give it,” Nicole Taylor, the foundation’s head, said in an interview with Recode. “It felt like now’s the time to put a number out there.”

The foundation is supposed to serve as a middleman, of sorts, between a donor and a nonprofit. But the law doesn’t require donors to actually transfer the money stored at the foundation to nonprofits anytime soon, and critics say that Silicon Valley Community Foundation officials haven’t exactly been pushing them to, either.

That appears to be over at the foundation. Donors very well could blow off SVCF. But while not a directive, close observers of the philanthropy scene describe the ask as bold, if not risky. Charitable advisers tend to go to great lengths to appease their millionaire and billionaire clients, lest they leave for a less-annoying advising team. That laissez-faire approach has helped the Silicon Valley Community Foundation pull in about $10 billion into these accounts, called donor-advised funds (DAFs).

For that reason, the move is at least symbolically significant: Taylor believes this is the first time SVCF has ever asked donors to commit a specific percentage for a specific cause. The subtext seems to be that during a historic crisis, when many in Silicon Valley’s backyard are struggling, the old coddling will not fly.

“In the DAF environment where sponsors often act in service of donors, the clear act of directing donor behavior and focusing on the mission, not the donor, is a big step,” said Brian Mittendorf, a longtime critic of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation’s growing assets.

The challenge could move real money. If every one of the foundation’s donors gave the full 5 percent, an extra $450 million in philanthropy would come off the sidelines, increasing the overall yearly charity from the foundation by about 25 percent. Foundation officials say its donors had given about $95 million so far to all Covid-19 relief efforts, and gave out 30 percent more money overall in March 2020 than in March 2019.

The ask is, nevertheless, one of the most significant steps made yet by Taylor, who took over last year to repair the foundation as it recovered from a scandal that ousted her predecessor, who was accused of pursuing a growth-at-all-costs culture that prioritized donors’ assets above employees’ morale. Taylor said she decided to put a number on it — rather than put out a more typical wishy-washy hope that people would “dig deep” or something like that — in part because of the scale of the crisis and in part as an experiment to see if a specific figure would work.

Taylor acknowledges this is a shift in the traditional role philanthropies play, with their long desire to “meet the donors where they’re at.” But she’s already thinking about how this could shift the power dynamics in the world of the wealthy, and is pondering future percentage targets that the SVCF might set for the donors even outside of a crisis.

“We can think now about how do we more proactively engage with our donors. Now they’re used to it,” she said. “It’s transformative thinking about the relationship between the donor and where the DAF is held.”

Taylor cannot direct money herself — the vehicles are called donor-advised funds because the donors are still supposed to advise where the money goes. These DAFs have become one of the most controversial things in billionaire philanthropy because they offer large, immediate tax breaks to donors without requiring an immediate or disclosed contribution to a charity. The DAF is meant to serve as a place for a wealthy person to place their cash now and to give away over the course of their lifetime. They have exploded in size over the past decade, as have questions about their fairness and whether this type of philanthropy is truly an effective way to solve society’s problems.

And to be sure, some activists counter that 5 percent is a relatively modest reaction to a once-in-a-generation pandemic. The net worths of many Silicon Valley billionaires have skyrocketed over the past decade, in many years by more than 5 percent. A crop of philanthropy advisers have called on billionaires and their foundations to drastically increase their charitable giving due to the coronavirus.

Taylor said she only asked for 5 percent because of how unprecedented this is for her group and because that’s the amount most foundations are typically required to spend each year. She also stressed that she’s planning another round of asks in a few months for the economic recovery phase.

This all could backfire — “You have to know how much to push,” she acknowledges. Taylor has been generally focusing her own calls on her biggest accounts, the billionaires of the world. Any of these billionaires who decide that the foundation is being a little too pushy would easily find open arms at the many other sponsors of DAFs, such as Goldman Sachs or Fidelity Investments. SVCF already lost some clients who fled in the wake of the workplace culture scandal in 2018.

Yet the mere request, no matter how modest, says a lot about how urgent this moment is for the world and how high the stakes are for philanthropists. While some tech donors like Twitter’s Jack Dorsey are making massive charitable commitments, the billionaire class has been criticized for a relatively “lackluster” response to the pandemic so far. That it’s even considered a risk or a big move for a $10 billion charity to ask its donors to give away a very small parcel of their fortune is revealing, and maybe a little dispiriting, too.

“They should be urging distribution of half of the value of the DAFs,” said Al Cantor, a nonprofit consultant who is also critical of DAFs. “Symbols won’t save the charitable sector. This is our greatest crisis since Pearl Harbor.”

"['Rebecca Heilweil', 'Apr']",2020-04-17,Coronavirus scammers are flooding social media with fake cures and tests,"For years, Timothy Mackey has been researching the sale of opioids and illicit drugs online, tracking how dealers have used social media to push controlled substances. But over the past few weeks, the UC San Diego public health researcher has found himself in the bowels of the internet, trying to track the black market for fake Covid-19 tests and treatments. It turns out the two realms of drug-dealing share some similar scams.

The coronavirus pandemic has fueled demand for a wide variety of products, including some that aren’t readily available to the general American public, like at-home testing kits. Other things, like government-approved, proven Covid-19 treatments or cures, don’t yet exist. But online opportunists are working hard to take advantage of the public’s desperation, selling counterfeits on social media platforms, e-commerce marketplaces, and the dark web.

Mackey told Recode that, even as a public health expert, he’s had trouble quickly differentiating between legitimate and illegitimate products online. That’s partially because news about the Covid-19 pandemic moves so quickly that information about a legitimate product or trial in one country can quickly inspire fake and unapproved products in another.

“Every week there’s a new product or a new scam going on,” Mackey says. The problem is so pervasive that someone even reached out to him (on LinkedIn, of all places) offering to sell him seemingly fake, rapid test kits in bulk.

A fake Covid-19 testing kit is more dangerous than a fake Chanel bag. A counterfeit test could lead someone to believe they’re negative when they’ve been infected. A fake cure could leave someone worse off than before, and possibly dead. Even a phony N95 mask might mislead a doctor into believing they’re protected in a hospital full of Covid-19 patients, where faulty equipment can lead to more spreading of the virus.

Don’t buy drugs or treatments on Instagram

There’s no proven treatment for Covid-19, but plenty of social media accounts are nevertheless illegally pushing so-called cures or treatments. Online, you can find people advertising drugs that are undergoing clinical trials but are not yet approved to treat Covid-19, like chloroquine, as well as more far-out fake treatments involving cow urine, colloidal silver, and even oregano.

Platforms like Instagram and Twitter have banned advertisements for these products, but enforcing those bans seems to be an ongoing challenge. After a few minutes of browsing, we were able to find several posts advertising Covid-19 medications and treatment, an outcome that suggests social platforms are stuck in a game of whack-a-mole with these products, despite the efforts of both human moderators and automation. That’s not unlike the same challenges these platforms have had with stopping the spread of Covid-19 conspiracy theories and fake news.

When Recode sent an example of a suspect chloroquine post to Twitter, the company removed it, citing its policy against the sale of regulated goods.

The trend in fake Covid-19 products is especially troublesome because many of these products can look convincing to the average person. Jay Kennedy, a professor at Michigan State University’s criminal justice school and Center for Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection, emphasizes that it’s relatively easy for counterfeiters to make the package of a fake product look believable: They can buy the vials and boxes from legitimate medical supply companies and then replicate any logos and certification stamps.

The accounts used to advertise these products might look less legitimate. They do not typically have a large number of followers, for instance, and they generally aren’t meant to exist long-term. Sellers have an incentive to keep them online just long enough to attract a buyer.

Mackey and his team are already analyzing a data set of 80 million tweets in addition to Instagram posts. Many of these posts prompt people to call them directly — perhaps using an encrypted app — using Covid-19 terms to advertise. They might ask potential buyers to use Bitcoin or other unusual payment schemes. Angelo Mazza, an intellectual property attorney who recently wrote a brief on Covid-19 counterfeits, adds that weird spellings and formatting of words are a strong hint that a seller isn’t authorized. The apparent typos might actually be attempts to evade screening algorithms set up by the social media platform.

Kennedy notes that another potential source of fake treatments is illegal online pharmacies, which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has repeatedly tried to crack down on. “Unlike pharmacies, the vast majority of online pharmacies sell counterfeit medications, and people can ‘get’ drugs, prescription medications without needing a prescription,” he explains.

Regardless, if you see a drug available on the internet that normally requires a prescription you don’t have, don’t buy it. Even if you do manage to get ahold of the real pharmaceutical, it’s dangerous to take a medication unsupervised. One person has already died from taking chloroquine phosphate, for instance, and a recent study shows that coronavirus patients may face the risk of fatal heart complications when taking the drug. Participating in the black market for hydroxychloroquine also contributes to a troubling shortage for people with lupus and arthritis, who can need it to stay healthy.

At-home, FDA-approved Covid-19 tests do not exist, but fake tests are still available online

Beyond fake treatments, social media sites are also filled with accounts pushing rapid, at-home Covid-19 tests. Mackey told Recode that these posts seemed to pop up online suddenly after March 22, likely driven by the news, and that forced his research focus to expand from bogus cures and treatment to various coronavirus testing products. Now, Mackey thinks he’ll spend more time scanning the web for antibody tests, since they’re increasingly being discussed by public health and government officials.

No tests for Covid-19 infection have been approved by the FDA for use at home. There are also no FDA-approved at-home serological tests, which measure the amount of Covid-19 antibodies in a patient’s body and, thus, detect their immunity to the disease. Currently, the best way to be tested for Covid-19 — if you’re considered eligible — is through a medical provider, such as an urgent care facility, a drive-through testing center, or a hospital.

“Most people probably don’t know how a normal test kit works,” explains Kennedy. “That’s one of the major disadvantages that we consumers have. We don’t know how things like that are supposed to operate.”

Black market Covid-19 test sellers seem eager to take advantage of this knowledge gap. On eBay, we found a listing for a “rapid test device” for the Covid-19 antibody from a seven-year-old seller with generally positive feedback. Claiming to be based in Lithuania, the account previously sold mostly clothing.

The product listed certainly seems to resemble a legitimate Covid-19 test. The packaging bears the logo of a company called Realy Tech. The FDA lists “Hangzhou Realy Tech” as a company that’s notified the agency as having validated a serological test on offer, but the agency has not approved or reviewed its validation. Of course, there’s no way to know if this product on eBay was even produced by Realy Tech.

An eBay spokesperson told Recode that the platform is taking steps to block and remove products that make “false health claims,” and by the time of publication, eBay had taken down the above post for promoting false health information. Facebook, meanwhile, had taken down a page that appeared to be from the company Realy Tech.

The fake Covid-19 test problem is more widespread than this single example. Mackey says that many posts like this, using phrases like “Doctor Coronavirus” and “Covid-19” in their usernames, could easily be caught by an algorithm.

When Recode identified examples to Twitter, they were removed for violating the platform’s manipulation and spam rules. Similarly, after Recode identified accounts pushing similar test kit products on Instagram, which were also removed, a Facebook spokesperson explained that the company will take down posts and accounts pushing such products when it is made aware of them.

You can still find people promoting fake test kits, along with other phony coronavirus products, on the dark web.

Suspicious Covid-19 products are already under investigation

Coronavirus-related scams aren’t limited to tests or treatments. As broken supply chains lead to shortages, instances of price-gouging and outright fraud regarding medical supplies are becoming increasingly worrisome. In late March, a health care workers union claimed to secure a stash of 39 million N95 masks to sell to hospitals, a huge claim at the time that many found dubious. The masks never ended up being delivered to some health care centers, and an attempted seizure by federal authorities revealed that they were part of an elaborate, international grift.

Mazza, the intellectual property attorney, points to this example as a warning of what’s to come. “If it sounds too good to be true, there’s likely a problem,” he says. “Let’s look out for the guys selling the magic beans — all the different cliches that come to mind, they’re going to apply tenfold here.”

The number of bad actors seems to be growing. On March 22, the Justice Department announced its “first enforcement action against Covid-19 fraud,” which involved shuttering and launching an investigation into a website that allegedly sold vaccines to unsuspecting Americans in an attempt to capitalize on the fear surrounding the pandemic. The FBI has since arrested one man, after he sold coronavirus “prevention pills” to an undercover agent. And in early April, Customs and Border Protection caught fake Covid-19 test kits being shipped in from the United Kingdom through the Los Angeles International Airport.

In some cases, government investigators are working with tech companies to catch scammers. For instance, Facebook, eBay, Amazon, and others have partnered with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr to go after price gougers and others hoping to profit from the Covid-19 crisis. Twitter, meanwhile, says it’s working with governments and public health authorities to crack down on content that promotes fake treatments.

Fakes will be pervasive as long as Covid-19 is

Ultimately, Mackey explains that trends in fakes and counterfeits will continue to coincide with topics in the news cycle. When there’s a legitimate, Covid-19-related product, scammers and counterfeit sellers will likely emerge to take advantage of the people desperate to get ahold of it.

If and when real versions of at-home tests become available, the problem of fake and scammy tests will likely worsen. Mackey warns that once a vaccine is available, we should expect to see more bogus vaccines pop up as well. And more than 50 health experts warned in a letter earlier this month that any shortages in legitimate Covid-19-related products will make the phony treatment and vaccine problems worse.

Eventually, the onslaught of fake Covid-19 products showing up online could just become part of our new reality.

“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Mackey said. “I mean, it’s a full-blown infodemic.”

"['Shirin Ghaffary', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,Facebook will start nudging users who have “liked” coronavirus hoaxes,"Facebook just announced another step in trying to set the record straight about misleading information about the novel coronavirus on its platform. In the coming weeks, the company will start directing people who have previously “liked,” reacted, or commented on “harmful misinformation” about Covid-19 to information from more authoritative sources, such as a myth-busters website by the World Health Organization (WHO).

This represents one of the first times Facebook will warn a specific set of users who have interacted in the past with false information. Experts have argued for years that the social network is rife with misleading information that taints public discourse and asked Facebook to take the retroactive approach.

“We want to connect people who may have interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus with the truth from authoritative sources in case they see or hear these claims again off of Facebook,” wrote Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, in a company blog post released on Thursday. The notifications will apply only to Facebook and not its other platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp.

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, social media users have been posting popular and dangerous hoaxes about the virus, including false cures and myths about the origins of the outbreak. In response, companies like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have been stepping up their measures to flag and sometimes delete this type of content. In March alone, Facebook says it labeled 40 million posts as “false” on its network, relying on its team of independent third-party fact-checkers. Still, plenty of bad information that fact-checkers don’t catch regularly slips through the cracks — or is caught only after tens of thousands of users have already seen the posts in question.

Facebook included a screenshot of a new News Feed message that will show users who have interacted false coronavirus information, pointing them to WHO resources.

The design Facebook provided looks more like a gentle nudge than a specific warning, and some have called for stronger notifications that specifically correct the record on individual false claims. When Recode asked about what the notifications will look like, a spokesperson for Facebook said the design in the blog post is an “early version” and that it’s also testing “more explicit” variations.

“We’ll continue to iterate on these designs with a goal of ensuring people who’ve been exposed to harmful misinformation about Covid-19 are connected with the facts,” said the spokesperson.

For Facebook’s critics, the move toward retroactively notifying users about misleading Covid-19 content, even if incremental, is a welcome development. Many academics and policy experts have scolded Facebook for lax moderation not only on Covid-related topics but also on misinformation around issues like immigration and politics. Historically, Facebook and other social media companies have been reluctant to flag politically contentious information as false, arguing that over-policing content on their platforms could limit free speech. But with the coronavirus, the company has adopted a more aggressive approach.

“[T]he company has taken a key first step in cleaning up the dangerous infodemic surrounding the coronavirus, but it has the power to do so much more to fully protect people from misinformation,” wrote Fadi Quran, campaign director at nonprofit activist group Avaaz, in a statement to Recode. Avaaz is one of several groups that has been pushing for stronger fact-checking and for corrections to be issued more broadly on the platform, not just on content about Covid-19. New research commissioned by the organization shows that Facebook corrections have a major impact in shaping users’ views and can effectively reduce people’s belief in misinformation by 50 percent.

Facebook declined to answer a question from Recode about whether it will apply its warnings to other types of misinformation in the future.

For companies like Facebook, it’s a lot easier to draw a line in the sand on misinformation about coronavirus topics than around more politically contentious ones, like gun rights, abortion, immigration, or even the 2020 US elections. While there’s still plenty of uncertainty about Covid-19 — even alleged biases of authoritative sources like the WHO have come under question — it’s still much easier to prove why a hoax about Covid-19 is wrong than it is to confirm the veracity of a personal attack on a politician.

In the next few weeks, we’ll learn more about what these new retroactive notifications to Facebook users that have been exposed to coronavirus misinformation will look like, not to mention how widely they’re being sent out. But it may take much longer before we see if Facebook’s new moderation strategy will be a lasting mechanism to fight misinformation online more broadly.

"['Peter Kafka', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,Trump’s denial of his coronavirus failings will be “one of the biggest propaganda battles in American history”,"Americans don’t trust the government, and they don’t trust the media. That trend has been evident for years, but the Trump era has accelerated it.

Now we can see the worst-case scenario that trend could create, playing out in front of our eyes: Confronted with a paralyzing coronavirus pandemic, there’s deep confusion about the steps the country should be taking to respond.

Don’t expect it to get better, says journalism critic Jay Rosen. That’s in large part because the Trump administration uses confusion as one of its primary political tools. Right now, it is employing it to create cover for the president, who wants to argue that he shouldn’t be blamed for a litany of missteps as the virus moved from China to the US and exploded across the country.

“The fight to keep Americans from understanding what happened from December to March is going to be one of the biggest propaganda battles in American history”

“The fight to keep Americans from understanding what happened from December to March is going to be one of the biggest propaganda battles in American history,” he told me recently. “The Republican Party and the Trump campaign and the MAGA coalition are going to have to produce confusion and doubt on a scale that is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before.”

That conflict is unfolding in plain sight: The point of that weird campaign video Trump rolled out at a White House press conference this week was to recast himself as bold and decisive in the face of the pandemic — as opposed to convincing reports in the New York Times, Washington Post, and other outlets emerging recently that portray him and his administration as dithering and confused, and slow to make crucial decisions like telling the country to start socially distancing.

It’s an extension of the challenge Trump has posed to journalists from the start of his administration, when he ordered his then-press secretary, Sean Spicer, to tell the press that his inauguration had an enormous audience instead of a paltry one. Or, in Trump’s words, delivered to a group of veterans in 2018: “Just remember, what you are seeing and what you are reading is not what’s happening.”

Rosen, who teaches journalism at New York University, has been meeting up with me once a year to discuss the challenges the Trump administration poses for the media. This year, instead of a podcast, we chatted via Skype, and I’m presenting edited excerpts of that conversation below.

If you read the story I wrote earlier this week about the media’s struggles to report on the pandemic, you’ll recognize similar themes in this conversation, which was happening while I was reporting that story; I’m grateful to Rosen for the opportunity to shape my thinking.

The Trump-era information gap

Peter Kafka

There’s a giant gap in the way the American public perceives or has perceived the pandemic. That split is both across political divides and across news consumption divides. Are you surprised in any way to see what we’re seeing today?

Jay Rosen

No.

Peter Kafka

We have talked about this sort of gap for several years. But did you imagine that this would manifest in a literal life-and-death crisis like this?

Jay Rosen

No, I never imagined a crisis like this. I did, like lots of other people, worry about what would happen in a truly serious event, combined with the Trump presidency. But I was thinking a war, a terrorist attack, a natural disaster of epic proportion, something like that.

But something like this, which affects everyone and is invisible and takes both science and imagination to understand — which I think is a very interesting point for us to discuss — I never conceived of something like this.

Peter Kafka

There have been many failures. I think one of them, for a lot of people — and I include myself here — is a failure of imagination, a failure to see this coming, even though people have literally made books and movies about this for years.

Jay Rosen

This possibility was talked about a lot. And warnings for the virus began early, and so there was plenty of information that it was going to become important.

But what I meant by imagination is something additional to that, which is: In order to understand what is happening now, in order to be informed, you need not only good information, reliable information, but you need imagination to see what it is.

Peter Kafka

Imagination buttressed with science ...

Jay Rosen

Yeah. That’s why [Dr. Anthony] Fauci and others say if it sounds like it’s too much, it’s just enough.

But it’s an incredibly difficult thing to tell people about, because unlike a hurricane or even a war, [the virus] is completely abstract. So that’s one of the challenges that journalists faced.

Peter Kafka

Right. You can’t see it until you either have it or you’re looking at someone who has it. Even now, one of the things that strikes me — and you see this manifesting on Twitter — is that even now when there are [thousands] of people who have died, because so much of it is happening in a hospital, or in someone’s house or en route to the hospital, that you’re not seeing it.

And while there’s plenty of reporting from inside hospitals ... in terms of visuals, you’re still not seeing it. And so you end up with scenes like people on Twitter saying they’re going to the Elmhurst Hospital in Queens to see if they can see these lines with people.

Jay Rosen

That’s a whole meme now — go to your hospital and take video of nothing happening so that you can own the libs.

Confusion and doubt as a strategy

Peter Kafka

Are you tracking the percentage of people who say they are worried [or] not worried, and how that’s evolving over time and what their sources of information are? It seems like it has changed over time, in part because at various times the president has said this is a serious thing, after saying it was not a serious thing.

Jay Rosen

Yeah. And this coheres with political science findings from long ago, that public opinion does follow what political leaders and party leaders are saying.

The recognition that there’s a reality there, that this thing is happening, it’s real, it’s not a story, it’s not a fake — I think that has grown. But as that has grown, so has the attempt to escape responsibility for that.

And I think this is a really important point that I’ve been trying to make: The fight to keep Americans from understanding what happened from December to March is going to be one of the biggest propaganda battles in American history. Because so much of it is public. We have so many statements from Trump minimizing the danger. So many things are already on the record.

The Republican Party and the Trump campaign and the MAGA coalition are going to have to produce confusion and doubt on a scale that is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. And that, of course, is going to be a huge challenge for the press.

But it’s much more than the press: I think the fight to interpret what happened in those first three months as someone else’s fault and to persuade Americans that it wasn’t Trump’s responsibility — when there are so many things on the record, like “giving myself a 10 out of 10” or “this is going to go away, it’ll just magically disappear.” All those things are going to have to be overridden somehow. And that is going to put a huge strain on the information system.

“The key for the Trump campaign is to create confusion, not belief. And that’s what we’re going to see in the months ahead — is the massive effort to create doubt and confusion about things that are overwhelmingly clear from the public record.”

Peter Kafka

In the pre-Trump era, any politician, let alone the president, who not only said this once but downplayed the virus multiples times — made a whole series of statements that were then not rebutted but actually refuted — that would be the end of the story. Right? It’s all on tape. We know what it is. There’s no doubt about it. There’s no debate.

In the Trump era, sadly, we’ve become used to the idea that Trump can say something on live TV in front of everyone and then is actually able to make it go away, magically. And that there is a significant chunk of the population that either will never hear it or refuse to believe it or doesn’t care.

So you’re describing a fight to come. But it seems like in some ways, this won’t be a fight: Both sides will already be resigned to either believe Trump or not believe Trump. Is there any reason to believe it’s different this time?

Jay Rosen

I think that’s a little oversimplified.

The Trump base will believe anything that he believes, and there’s already polling data indicating that his core supporters trust Trump as a source of information far more than they trust the news media or any other institution. So for that group, yes.

Then, of course, there’s a large group of Trump doubters, who are also, not coincidentally, more likely to think that the mainstream media can be trusted as a source of information.

But there are people who are in neither of those camps. I wouldn’t call them centrist. I wouldn’t try to characterize their ideology. But they’re not in either one of those camps. And for those people, the key for the Trump campaign is to create confusion, not belief. And that’s what we’re going to see in the months ahead: the massive effort to create doubt and confusion about things that are overwhelmingly clear from the public record.

Peter Kafka

One side says this. The other side says that. I can’t make up my mind; I’m going to either ignore it or shrug my shoulders.

Jay Rosen

Yeah, it’s already happening. Like, [New York City Mayor] Bill de Blasio does not have a great record in himself and warning his public. He went to the gym way after it was too dangerous to do that. And so there is some responsibility there, right? Compared to Trump’s responsibility, it’s, you know, small. But it’s real.

That kind of fact is going to interact with on the one hand/on the other hand journalism. And they’re going to try and, of course, blow that up.

Another thing that has already started happening is people keep sending me this graphic. I don’t know who created it, but I’ll send it to you. That is all the headlines from various sources that minimized the virus, that said it’s not going to be that big of a deal — some similar things to what Trump said.

The attempt is to say that it was the “MSM” — a term I don’t use, but they do — it was the mainstream media that misled us.

Why didn’t the media do better?

Peter Kafka

I did want to ask you about that. Do you think the mainstream media — I’ll use the term — could have done a better job of raising the alarm earlier?

Jay Rosen

Probably, yes. As with other very big crises, like the 2008 economic crisis, you can go back and you can find reports that gave the appropriate warnings. But the overall tone of the coverage did not accomplish that.

I think the same thing will be true here. There are definitely reports — quite a few — that said this thing is bigger than the political system seems to be acknowledging. And then even before this particular virus arose, the possibility of a global virus like this, having this kind of effect, was very well known and discussed quite a bit.

So there is some responsibility there from the news media. But the news media of course isn’t one organism.

“If the president and the White House [were] hair on fire about this, there is no doubt there would be media coverage of the same type”

Peter Kafka

I’ve been thinking about this for a while. I think there are probably two different reasons that the media, broadly, was not more alarmist about this. One is a sincere desire not to be alarmist — in general, and specifically over a health crisis. If you’re telling people this is going to be terrible, and you quote people who are stocking up on food, you can have a run on markets.

Jay Rosen

I think it would be part of the reason that you didn’t see kind of a “Time out, nothing else matters. Pay attention to this.” That would be one reason.

But another way to look at it would be if the president and the White House [were] hair on fire about this, there is no doubt there would be media coverage of the same type. So that’s a factor as well.

There’s a lot of resistance to reporting on something that is a possibility.

Peter Kafka

But the other thing is that for many journalists, this reporting involved going to health experts — often the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] or the WHO [World Health Organization], or people like that — and saying, “What should we think about this?” and then reporting what they say.

Now we’re seeing that, in some cases, those institutions themselves were behind in sounding the alarm, being more vocal about the alarm, and some of their advice and prognostications have changed.

And it seems like that would pose a real challenge if you are a good reporter, and you go to what is supposedly a nonpartisan institution staffed with experts, and they’re saying this is our view — that it’d be very hard for you to run against that.

Jay Rosen

I agree with that. Journalism scholars say that news reporters are dependent on “authorized knowers.” This would be a very good example of that. When the authorized knowers aren’t making a big deal of something, it’s extremely difficult for journalists to do that.

“News” is a fundamental problem for the news

Peter Kafka

What do you make of the Ben Thompson argument that this is why Twitter was particularly valuable? Because you had all sorts of experts on Twitter — sometimes they weren’t sanctioned by the CDC, sometimes they were smart people in Silicon Valley — and they’ve had insight and we should have listened to them more than the CDC or the WHO at various points?

Jay Rosen

Well, if the question is the availability of information that warned us that this was coming — yes, that information was available. And you could find it in part by doing your own research. That’s true.

But the problem is not really the availability of good information that turned out to be right and important. It’s the combination of good information and public attention.

Peter Kafka

Which is kind of the job of the media. To contextualize that information and to put it out.

Jay Rosen

Yes, and to order things. This is one of the problems we have with our news system. The news tends to be, to use a colloquial expression, “one damn thing after another.” And what it’s not that good at — even though people say that front pages do this — it’s not that good at helping us organize stories in order of priority.

Like telling us what’s most important to worry about. And next most important, and maybe third or fourth. And keeping those priorities both stable, in the sense that they don’t change day to day, but also be able to evolve as big events evolve. We don’t really have anything like that. And so it tends to be one damn thing after another.

If you just think about producing today’s news, then a sense of hierarchy, a sense of relative importance, disappears from the flow of content. This is a big problem with our news system. It’s not the fault of any one journalist or any one news organization. It’s a problem with relying on news for our knowledge.

Peter Kafka

But there are hierarchies. There’s the top of the newscast. If you know how to interpret the New York Times, you know that the story on the far right is the most important even though it may be under a smaller headline than the rest of the page. That is part of the job of media, right? Packaging that and ordering it?

Jay Rosen

Yes. But that tends to be a little bit different than what I said. That’s “here’s the most important new thing that happened today.”

But some things are not new, but they are the most important thing. So some things are persistent and still the most important thing today. And when you have things like that, where actually the news of the day doesn’t change the fact that you should be worried about X, Y, and Z first — that’s where the system breaks down.

Does this get better?

Peter Kafka

I want to come back to the original idea here that I had when I was talking to you, which was: Is there anything we can do about a partisan divide and a news source divide that is now literally a life-and-death situation? Is there any practical solution to this problem today in 2020?

Jay Rosen

Well, as the reality of the virus grows and everyday life is affected and people have extremely practical questions like, “What do I do? How do I protect my family?” the news at the local level becomes extremely important because people need to know where to go, what to do.

So it’s possible that local news providers will experience kind of a rebirth of both use and trust from the many questions and crises that arise from this situation.

And a relationship with a local news provider is basic to how people develop trust in journalism and in the news media as an institution. And so if people’s connection to local news providers is strengthened by this — which does happen sometimes in civic emergencies, like hurricanes, for example — that could change things a little bit.

I don’t think it’s going to change opinion at the level of Fox versus NBC and Trump versus Jonathan Karl. It doesn’t touch that. But reestablishing trust and utility with local publics could help journalism quite a lot.

Peter Kafka

That would be great. And it would be great if we have local news outlets that are still around to perform that function.

Jay Rosen

Well, this is part of the problem. Those newsrooms are themselves impoverished. And so it makes it extremely difficult.

"['Sara Morrison', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,Apple and Google look like problematic heroes in the pandemic,"Apple and Google are a month away from launching a series of updates to their smartphone operating systems that will use Bluetooth signals to track potential coronavirus cases. This week, the companies confirmed to Recode that the contact-tracing technology will go away when the pandemic does, which should assuage some privacy concerns. But as two of the world’s tech superpowers prepare to embed new surveillance features into their devices, skepticism mounts. Will Apple and Google’s joint effort to fight the virus have unintended consequences?

When the contact-tracing tool was announced, there was no indication that the software required to make it work would be temporary. That it involved changes to mobile operating systems actually made it seem more likely that it would be a permanent fixture. Apple and Google have said this deep integration was the only way to enable the nonstop tracking necessary for the contact-tracing tool to function properly. Nevertheless, the permanency of such a tool could lead to its features being used for other purposes, once its intended use was no longer needed. So it seems to be a relief that Apple and Google plan to sunset the contact-tracing tool at the end of the pandemic, though details about exactly which software features will go away and what qualifies as the “end of the pandemic” still need to be explained.

By promising an expiration date, Apple and Google have addressed a chief concern for privacy advocates, some of whom have been uncharacteristically amenable to certain types of tracking during the pandemic. But many more questions remain. How will Apple and Google prevent their tool from being abused by governments with access to it? How will the companies ensure that contact-tracing systems remain optional for smartphone users? Will the tool be effective enough to warrant the privacy compromises it requires?

“This is an extraordinary time,” Bennett Cyphers, staff technology at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Recode before the time limit was announced. “It means that we would accept some pretty extraordinary things that EFF would normally never endorse. But that has to come with some kind of limit on how it can be used and for how long it can be used.”

Although they seem to have answered the “how long” question, Apple and Google have so far provided limited information about the tool itself. The companies have released some technical documents showing how the system works, and they’ve answered a few questions from the media. But that’s about it. Beyond confirming that the tool would end, neither Apple nor Google has responded to Recode’s requests for comment.

The tool could leave a dangerous door open

The new Apple-Google tool sounds miraculous at first blush. Starting in mid-May, the companies plan to release software updates that will allow iOS and Android phones to exchange anonymized keys through Bluetooth to any other phones that come within a certain proximity. These feature will enable interoperability between iOS and Android phones, and public health authorities will exclusively build apps based on an application programming interface (API) built by Apple and Google. If a user tests positive for coronavirus, they will inform the app, which will then alert people who have been close enough to the infected person for their phones to exchange Bluetooth keys. The alert will tell them they’ve been in contact with an infected person, without revealing the person’s identity.

Although this talk of tracking and tracing might sound daunting, the Apple-Google tool includes specific privacy protections, such as using anonymized keys that change every 15 minutes to prevent anyone from tracing a specific key back to an individual; storing data on users’ devices rather than on a central server; using proximity detection instead of location data; and making the entire program opt-in. Apple and Google have said privacy and user trust was at the forefront of their collective minds when developing the tool.

Not everyone believes these good intentions can hold. Apple and Google’s privacy promises ring hollow to people who have seen how both companies have built themselves on the back of privacy compromises, many of which were made without the consumer’s knowledge.

“Two corporations, Apple and Google, have come to dominate the smartphone software ecosystem, and they have spent years spying on users and enabling consumer surveillance in their app stores,” Michael Kwet, a visiting fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project, told Recode. “In the world we built, we now have to weigh the fate of our lives and economy against trust in Apple and Google, the ad-tech industry they support, and government intelligence agencies. … This is a nightmare.”

Just look at how well the tools hidden in many apps available through Apple and Google marketplaces can track you. And Google has trackers installed all over the internet, gathering first- and third-party data about potentially everything you do online. One way or another, everyone from location-data brokers to law enforcement can get access to a lot of your data through these companies’ devices. Apple and Google have made several efforts to combat some of these intrusions, but such intervention only shows that the companies can’t foresee all of the unintended consequences their innovations may have. They can only respond to them after the fact.

We also don’t yet know which countries, states, or cities will be participating in the Apple-Google contact-tracing effort. We do know that the API will be made available only to those governments’ public health authorities, though it’s unclear if the companies will take measures to prevent authoritarian governments from using the technology in unintended ways.

Along those lines, while users must opt-in to the contact-tracing feature, we don’t know if health authorities will be able build apps on top of the Apple-Google technology that could enable more invasive tracking. We’ve already seen systems like this in other parts of the world. The Chinese government, for example, made an app that assigns a health code to users, who must then show a healthy code in order to move around freely. The Apple-Google tool doesn’t do this, but it could be used to perform a similar function.

“I think there’s a very real possibility that businesses could, for example, require that their employees show proof of ‘non-infection’ before they’re permitted to return to work — voluntarily, of course,” Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist who has written about privacy issues and Bluetooth tracking, told Recode.

Soltani also wondered what Apple and Google will do to prevent developers from adding identifiers in the apps they build using the contact-tracing API, such as location information and names.

On Thursday, the European Union released a list of privacy requirements for member states developing contact-tracing apps, suggesting the EU has some privacy concerns with regard to the Apple-Google tool. On the list is “urgent engagement with owners of the mobile operating systems” to ensure that the tool is “compatible with the EU common approach.” Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s National Health Service was reportedly looking into ways to identify supposedly anonymous users of the contact-tracing app it is developing. The NHS plans to integrate the Apple-Google tool into that app, according to the BBC.

It’s not inconceivable that something like this could happen in the United States, where there are already instances of public health authorities sharing positive coronavirus tests with the police. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, an advocate of data-privacy legislation, said in a statement that he “urgently want[ed] to know how Apple and Google will assure that consumers’ privacy interests are strongly balanced with the legitimate needs of public health officials during the coronavirus pandemic,” adding that “a public health crisis cannot be a pretense to pave over our privacy laws or legitimize tech companies’ intrusive data collection about American’s personal lives.”

Bluetooth technology may not be up to the job

Privacy and security are chief among the concerns with the Apple-Google tool, but there are also issues with the technology itself. While more precise than GPS, Bluetooth signals may not be good enough to determine the proximity of other devices with the accuracy needed for contact tracing. The precision of these signals can depend on several factors, but some estimates suggest the technology could struggle with the 6-foot social distancing recommendation. If a Bluetooth signal can only determine your location to within 30 feet, for example, you’d get a notification that you were in proximity to an infected person when you might actually be at a safe distance. (Exactly how far the coronavirus can travel in the air remains unclear.) These false positives could happen in a densely populated location with such frequency that they become meaningless.

Bluetooth signals can also travel through physical barriers, so the Apple-Google contact-tracing tool might get mixed up if there’s a wall between two devices. That means you could get a notification about being exposed to the coronavirus when, in reality, you and the other person are in two separate apartments. The opposite could also be true: You might not get a notification when you have been exposed in a way the Bluetooth-based system didn’t register.

“The false negatives are the ones that concern me more,” Susan Landau, a cybersecurity and policy professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, told Recode.

False negatives could happen in many different ways. The infected person might not use the tool, or they may not have their phone on them when they came near you. Or someone with the virus might sneeze or cough more than 6 feet away from you. They wouldn’t trigger the proximity alert, but you still could have been exposed. Meanwhile, if this data is then used by governments to justify lifting shelter-in-place ordinances, any inaccuracies could be very costly.

“It’s essentially going to give us a false sense of safety while simultaneously infringing on people’s rights,” Soltani said.

Voluntary participation may not be enough

Finally, assuming the privacy issues don’t lead to any sinister outcomes and the Bluetooth technology pulls through, the Apple-Google contact-tracing tool might fail due to statistics. There’s the minimum percentage of the population that will have to participate in digital contact tracing in order for it to be effective. An Oxford University study puts the minimum at about 60 percent. And while having it integrated into the vast majority of smartphone operating systems — an estimated 3 billion people worldwide own an Apple or Android smartphone — is one of the better ways to encourage that, it still leaves out billions of people who don’t have smartphones.

Even in America, where 81 percent of adults own smartphones, mass adoption will be tricky from both a cultural and practical perspective. Smartphones are still less accessible to lower-income people and seniors, populations that have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and will increasingly be left behind. Those who do have phones will have to download the latest software updates (and have newer-model phones that can support the updates), download the app from the relevant public health authority, carry their phones with them everywhere they go, and want to participate in the first place. The bar to entry might simply be too high for too many people.

“We cannot solve a pandemic by coding the perfect app,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in its report about such digital contact-tracing tools. “Hard societal problems are not solved by magical technology, among other reasons because not everyone will have access to the necessary smartphones and infrastructure to make this work.”

Even if the Google-Apple tool achieves the necessary widespread adoption, it alone may not be enough to eliminate or reduce the spread of the virus. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said in a recent Project on Government Oversight panel discussion that contact tracing alone was a “somewhat superficial and not very meaningful” solution.

“When your house is on fire, there’s no way to do contact tracing,” Osterholm said. “[Coronavirus] is everywhere ... The only thing we know that really will work is a primary shutdown.”

This is especially true when you consider that many people who have the virus and are contagious are asymptomatic, meaning they never get tested at all. Only a mass-testing program, experts say, will allow people to safely stop social distancing. We need to significantly increase our testing capabilities for this; estimates range from 750,000 tests a week to 35 million a day. We aren’t anywhere near even the lower end yet, and there are many factors preventing us from achieving it anytime soon, from a shortage of basic materials like testing swabs to questions about the tests’ accuracy.

Landau, the Tufts professor, noted that even if Apple and Google use the tool only for the duration of the pandemic, we don’t know how they’ll define the end of the pandemic, and no one knows when that will be.

“It’s tempting to say after a certain time, the app will die,” she said. “We don’t know how long that will be. We don’t know if we’ll have a vaccine. We don’t know what percentage of the population will respond to that vaccine. There’s all sorts of unknowns.”

Even assuming Apple and Google have the most altruistic of intentions, their tool likely won’t be the pandemic-fighting silver bullet we all want. If we don’t know that it will solve this problem, it’s harder to justify the additional problems it will create. Altering their phones’ operating systems — even if that change is temporary — is a big deal. We can only hope the ends justify the means.

"['Jason Del Rey', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-16,Amazon is teasing a new health care offering — for its sellers,"In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon appears to be considering a new business: helping Amazon sellers with their own health insurance needs. Amazon sellers account for nearly 60 percent of Amazon’s retail sales, with around 900,000 active Amazon seller accounts in the US alone. That merchant base gives Amazon a huge potential target for such an offering.

Earlier this week, Amazon sent out a survey to its sellers, inquiring about the types of health insurance coverage these merchants offer their own employees. The survey, which Recode viewed, asked whether the sellers are satisfied with the coverage or would consider alternative options.

“What can be improved on your current health coverage?” one question asked. “Are you interested in alternative health insurance options?” asked another.

The survey also included questions about how much a seller pays in insurance premiums and what percentage of premiums fall on employees to cover. Amazon also asked about the complexity of choosing good and affordable health insurance plans for their employees and how satisfied they are with their coverage.

In the language of the survey, Amazon did not firmly commit to creating a health care or health insurance offering for its sellers and their respective employee bases. But the survey did end by saying “[w]e will keep you informed as we explore how Amazon may be able to support your needs better.”

In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson told Recode the company understands that its “selling partners are experiencing unexpected setbacks as a result of COVID-19.”

“Our Small Business team continuously works to empower seller success,” the statement continued. “As such, this survey is one of the many ways we engage with our seller community to explore opportunities for us to assist and support as needed and appropriate.”

The prospect of Amazon potentially offering some sort of health care or health insurance service to its seller community should not come as a total surprise to those paying attention to the company’s many encroachments into the health space in recent years, both on an enterprise level for its own company and employees, as well as on the consumer side.

In 2018, Amazon announced a joint health care venture with JPMorgan Chase and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Since named Haven, the venture is run by Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and New Yorker magazine writer, and it’s currently aimed at serving the million-plus employees of the founding companies and their families. Its goals are vaguely described on its website as “making primary care easier to access, insurance benefits simpler to understand and easier to use, and prescription drugs more affordable.” The venture says its hope is to eventually serve a wider customer base than just its own company staff. This year, the company launched Amazon Care, a virtual health care clinic for its Seattle-based employees. Amazon Care users download an app to connect with doctors and nurses for video-based virtual consultations.

On the consumer side of its business, Amazon purchased the online pharmacy startup PillPack in 2018 and has marketed the service to its Prime members. When Amazon first announced some of these initiatives, the news often sent the stock prices of publicly traded health insurance companies sliding.

News of Amazon’s interest in potentially offering health insurance-related products to its sellers comes as scrutiny mounts on tech companies who don’t provide health coverage to the hundreds of thousands of delivery people and drivers who make their services work. Amazon’s package delivery network, for example, relies heavily on delivery people working for themselves or mom-and-pop third-party firms.

But this potential new business line addresses a different group of people who do business with Amazon. The creation of a health care service for its sellers could serve as a third avenue into health care: a business-to-business offering. Amazon could be considering something as straightforward as an online tool to help steer sellers toward health insurance plans that make the most sense for their business, or it may be contemplating something more hands-on.

Either way, the survey is another reminder that Amazon sees the health care industry as one ripe for new business lines — even during a pandemic.

"['Theodore Schleifer', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,Google’s former CEO hopes the coronavirus makes people more “grateful” for Big Tech,"Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, thinks the coronavirus pandemic should teach Americans to be “a little bit grateful” for powerful tech companies — and angry at their government.

One of the country’s richest people, Schmidt made his most extensive comments about the pandemic to date on Tuesday, criticizing Washington’s response to the crisis as so ham-handed that it “cost us lives.” To the contrary, Schmidt argued, private companies like Amazon have stepped up as leaders, which Schmidt suggested should soften our criticism of tech giants more broadly.

“Think about what your life would be like in America without Amazon, for example. The benefit of these corporations — which we love to malign — in terms of the ability to communicate ... the ability to get information, is profound — and I hope people will remember that when this thing is finally over,” Schmidt said on a livestream to the Economic Club of New York. “So let’s be a little bit grateful that these companies got the capital, did the investment, built the tools that we’re using now and have really helped us out. Imagine having the same reality of this pandemic without these tools.”

That messaging, which few other tech leaders have made so starkly, comes amid two related trends: Big Tech is indeed using its resources and know-how for the common good, such as the announcement last week that Apple and Google would deploy their technology to trace people who may be infected with Covid-19. But concerns are also mounting that these companies — and the billionaires leading them — will emerge more powerful than ever as we gravitate toward digital companies like Amazon and away from their competitors in traditional retail.

Some activists are worried that the calls for antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech — which have been rising from both the left and the right in the years leading up to the pandemic — will recede in part due to the big roles that tech companies and its leaders are playing during it.

Schmidt is no longer operationally involved at Google and is now a technical adviser to its parent company, Alphabet. But he remains one of tech’s highest-profile figures, with broad influence in Silicon Valley, big-dollar philanthropy, and Democratic politics.

And on Tuesday, Schmidt voiced deep frustration over US politicians’ speed, or lack thereof, in responding to the virus. Without ever uttering “Trump,” Schmidt said it was “amazing” and he was “curious” as to why the government had not acted more quickly to allocate money to scientists, organize research priorities, and ramp up testing capabilities in the first two months of 2020.

“We probably were one month late in the way we organized ourselves,” Schmidt said. “That month cost us lives.”

At this point, Schmidt is squinting to see if there is a way to begin reopening the economy anytime soon. But because of the lack of widespread testing, governors will essentially be “making stuff up” and are “flying blind” as they make some of the hardest decisions over the next few months, such as when to reopen schools. The hope would be to turn this judgment into a “straightforward math problem,” he said, where you could deduce which establishments are the easiest to open.

“This will change our society for much longer than we think,” he said. “It’s not going to be a quick recovery back to the hugging and kissing and restaurants and all the behaviors that were perfectly fine before the pandemic.”

And yet Schmidt appeared quite sympathetic to the notion that the status quo of total lockdowns could not go on, predicting a “significant bankruptcy cycle” if it persisted for another month or two. However, he said it will be impossible to reopen the economy until there is sufficient personal protective equipment, testing, and progress on a vaccine.

“That strategy keeps us closed for months — which is neither a politically reasonable solution nor economically viable,” Schmidt said. “And it’s not fair to the people who are really suffering.”

"['Jason Del Rey', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,Amazon fired 3 employee activists who criticized its warehouse safety measures,"Amazon fired three of its employees over the last few days who criticized the company’s handling of warehouse worker safety during the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.

The company terminated the jobs of Bashir Mohamed, a warehouse worker at an Amazon facility in Minnesota, as well as corporate employees Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, last week. Mohamed told BuzzFeed News he believes he was fired for his activist role; Cunningham and Costa told the Washington Post they believe they were targeted for similar reasons.

In statements to Recode, Amazon said it supports employees’ right to criticize their employer but that Mohamed was fired “as a result of progressive disciplinary action for inappropriate language, behavior, and violating social distancing guidelines.” Cunningham and Costa’s employment was terminated for “repeatedly violating internal policies.”

The dismissals come less than two weeks after Amazon fired Christian Smalls, a warehouse worker who led a small walkout at the company’s Staten Island, New York, fulfillment center to demand better health precautions for facility workers. That prompted New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to announce a plan to investigate why Amazon fired Smalls, and it sparked outrage among some Amazon white-collar employees after the company’s top lawyer referred to Smalls as “not smart, or articulate” in leaked notes from an executive meeting.

The firings once again highlight the growing tension between Amazon and both internal and external activists who believe the company has not done enough to keep the front-line workers in its warehouses and delivery network safe during this once-in-a-generation pandemic. Amazon has dubbed these employees “heroes” and was one of the first companies operating during the pandemic to raise pay for its workers, by $2 an hour. In the last 10 days, the company has started providing workers with personal protective equipment, and it has also implemented temperature checks for workers at the beginning of shifts. But some workers have argued that some of the measures came too late and that figuring out how to qualify for the extra paid time off if you’ve been affected by the virus is still an unacceptably confusing process.

“People like Bashir, Emily, and Maren are bravely raising an important national conversation about Amazon’s utter failure to protect the health and safety of workers and the public in the middle of a pandemic,” Dania Rajendra, director of Athena, a coalition of activist groups criticizing Amazon’s labor and business practices, said in a statement to Recode. “Amazon could have chosen to listen to them. Instead, the company chose to silence them.”

The conflict comes at a moment the company is in the spotlight more than ever before, having been transformed during the global health crisis from a convenient method of one-click shopping into an essential service that millions of US residents have relied on as states and cities have issued stay-at-home orders across the country. Still, the company is set up to potentially become more dominant than it was before, as many of its brick-and-mortar retail competitors have been forced to shutter their stores and furlough or lay off thousands of employees.

Mohamed had been a worker organizer at a Minneapolis Amazon warehouse, where he had previously pushed for better working conditions. He most recently “had begun pushing for more rigorous cleaning and other measures to protect against the transmission of the coronavirus,” according to BuzzFeed News, which first broke news of his firing.

The two fired corporate employees, Cunningham and Costa, had worked at Amazon for more than two decades combined and had been vocal leaders of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an activist group that has criticized the company’s negative impact on the environment, including its work with oil companies. Amazon had previously threatened both employees with termination after they spoke publicly without permission about company business practices.

On Friday, the company also reportedly told another corporate employee, Chris Hayes, who had told the company he would quit on April 17 over its treatment of warehouse workers, that he was no longer allowed to finish working as originally planned. Hayes told the New York Times he was notified of this hours after he sent out an invitation to his corporate colleagues to a virtual discussion with warehouse workers and author Naomi Klein to discuss labor conditions at Amazon. The invitation for the discussion Hayes sent out has been deleted, according to three Amazon employees who spoke with Recode.

In recent weeks, the climate group Cunningham and Cost helped lead had circulated an open letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, urging him to improve warehouse worker safety amid confirmed Covid-19 cases at dozens of company facilities. The two workers had also either tweeted or retweeted criticism of the company’s warehouse labor practices in recent weeks and offered to match donations to front-line workers.

“I truly believe Amazon can play an incredibly powerful and good role during COVID-19,” said Cunningham in a statement sent to Recode. “But to do that, we have to really listen to the workers who are on the front line, who don’t feel adequately protected. Who fear getting coronavirus, or giving it to their families and the wider public.”

"['Rani Molla', 'Apr']",2020-04-14,This is the end of the office as we know it,"This is the end of the office as we know it

Share All sharing options for: This is the end of the office as we know it

If and when you return to your office after the novel coronavirus pandemic, you’ll probably notice some differences.

Upon entering your building, the doors may open automatically so you don’t have to touch the handles. Before you board your elevator, you might tell the elevator where you’d like to go, rather than pressing the many buttons within the elevator. When you reach your floor, you could walk into a room full of dividers and well-spaced desks instead of the crowded open floor plan you’re used to. In common areas like meeting rooms and kitchens, expect to see fewer chairs and posted documentation of the last time they were cleaned.

These are just the changes you can see. Less noticeable in the post-coronavirus office would be more frequent cleaning policies, antimicrobial properties woven into fabrics and materials, amped-up ventilation systems, or even the addition of UV lights for more deeply disinfecting the office at night.

Of course, this is all assuming you go back to your old office at all. As the coronavirus takes a steep toll on the economy and the workforce, many won’t have jobs to go back to. Some who are still employed will now permanently work from home, and some employers will choose to downsize their leases or look for flexible office space rather than long-term leases. Coworking spaces will probably never be what they once were as they forgo hot desks and communal spaces for more sanitary — and less profitable — private areas.

Many of these adjustments in office design are actually just accelerations of real estate trends that existed well before the pandemic. But just as policies around telehealth and liquor have quickly shifted, the Covid-19 crisis will force swift and permanent changes in both commercial real estate and work culture itself. The office as we know it will never be the same.

Working from home will be the new normal for many

According to a new MIT report, 34 percent of Americans who previously commuted to work report that they were working from home by the first week of April due to the coronavirus. That’s the same percentage of people who can work from home, according to a recent University of Chicago publication.

These new numbers represent a seismic shift in work culture. Prior to the pandemic, the number of people regularly working from home remained in the single digits, with only about 4 percent of the US workforce working from home at least half the time. However, the trend of working from home had been gaining momentum incrementally for years, as technology and company cultures increasingly accommodated it. So it’s also likely that many Americans who are now working from home for the first time will continue to do so after the pandemic.

“Once they’ve done it, they’re going to want to continue,” said Kate Lister, president of consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics, which is currently running a survey about work-from-home participation. She predicts that 30 percent of people will work from home multiple days per week within a couple of years. Lister added that there has been pent-up demand by employees for greater work-life flexibility, and that the coronavirus has made their employers see the light, especially as they themselves have had to work from home.

“It had been proven prior to this, but a lot of company management and leaders showed great skepticism,” Steve King, partner at small-business consulting firm Emergent Research, told Recode. “That skepticism will go away because companies recognize that remote work does work.”

There’s a lot more at play than what employers and workers want, of course. The economic impact of the pandemic will likely force many employers to cut costs. For companies to reduce their rent obligations by letting workers work from home is an easy solution, one that’s less painful than layoffs. In Lister’s words, “The investor community is going to insist on it.”

Furthermore, the necessity of working from home brought on by the pandemic has also caused many employers and employees to spend money on new technology, like video conferencing subscriptions as well as new equipment. According to data from expense management provider Emburse, the most frequent employee expenses in the first half of March included computer monitors, desks, office supplies, mice, and keyboards — a departure from the norm. These purchases presumably happened at companies where working from home was a new development.

“Companies were caught with their pants down,” said Lister. “Companies where the technology and culture were aligned with working from home were more successful in working from home than others.”

More formalization and company policies around remote work are necessary for the shift to be successful. A recent PWC study showed that about half of businesses expect a dip in productivity during the pandemic due to a lack of remote work capabilities. Companies where people have worked from home for a while and have built up guidelines — about, say, what time of night is appropriate to expect a response on Slack, how employees can securely access company files, and whether employees are allowed to expense an at-home monitor or standing desk — will probably have an easier time working from home.

Employees themselves are also spending more money to create better home offices. Katie Storey, principal at Storey Design, says that her residential and commercial interior design firm is already seeing the trend.

“The dog is going to walk through the meeting, your child is going to walk through. Period. We’ve just relaxed our standards to that. Maybe it will bring us closer.”

“Instead of allocating a corner of the den,” she said, “there’s now a real focus on where can we convert a closet or add a room under the steps or where can we reconfigure parts of the house to be more functional work-from-home space.”

Regardless of how prepared they were, people have done what they had to do to make working from home work. In doing so, they moved the needle on what’s acceptable in the at-home office.

“It added some humanity to us,” Lister said. “You don’t have a choice: The dog is going to walk through the meeting, your child is going to walk through. Period. We’ve just relaxed our standards to that. Maybe it will bring us closer.”

Coronavirus will likely change the way office space looks and works

Working from home all the time is not for everyone, and many will want to return to the office. As the public health crisis continues, however, office space will probably have to be altered in order for people to feel safe being there. That could mean a reversal of the open office trend.

For years, the amount of privacy allotted to each person working in an office had been steadily decreasing as companies of all stripes adopted the ubiquitous — if often loathed — open office plan. In effect, that meant a very cool-looking office space where you could see many of your coworkers but where there was little separation between you and your colleagues’ germs. Prior to the open office, offices used to have, well, offices, or at least cubicles that divided up the larger space and gave employees a semblance of privacy

“I do think this is going to reshape the workplace,” Janet Pogue-McLaurin, principal and workplace leader at design and architecture firm Gensler, told Recode. “Social distance thinking may be part of our DNA moving forward.”

That means people will want more space. Following the last recession, companies had been trying to do more with less space. That meant packing more and more people into open office spaces, a practice known as “densification.”

“Densification will take a hiatus,” Pogue-McLaurin said. “We’ll shift to, ‘How do we dedensify to create the physical distancing that we now need to have?’”

That could mean more private spaces or personal offices for individuals, and more distance between desks. Rather than desk setups that face each other or are right next to each other, we might now be positioned to our colleague’s backs with more space between us. A conference room that normally fit 10 people might now only hold chairs for five. Expect greater spacing and fewer seating options in communal areas like kitchens as well.

“Every configuration of every floor plan should be assessed to look at distancing and safety,” Kate North, vice president of workplace strategy at Colliers International real estate company, said.

This could also mean the reintroduction of various types of barriers between desks, including much maligned cubicles, in order to block the passage of germs — an effort that might be harder given the prevalence these days of standing desk options.

Christine Cavataio, president and chief operating officer at architecture firm Cuningham Group, thinks that while physical barriers will be used in the short term, the more long-term architectural fix will be done with spacing.

In the immediate future, “we’ll see physical, hard things that create separation,” Cavataio said. “Over time, we will start to design differently to create space, versus how tight can we get it. Can we get our generous six feet of physical distance and still create a company environment people want to be in, knowing you have safety inherently based in the design?”

Commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield is testing a new design concept called “Six Feet Office” in which it visually displays unique foot traffic routing in the office to keep people the recommended six feet apart.

Perhaps more importantly, though less visible, will be the actions that facilities managers take to divert congestion points and clean offices. International Facility Management Association (IFMA) is currently working in tandem with other specialized groups for cleaning and ventilation systems, among other things, to create guidelines and protocols for building operators around the world.

“There’s going to be a special effort to consider and think about every possible place within the built environment that a human being has touched and the possibility of that being a source of contamination,” Don Gilpin, president and chief operating officer at IFMA, said.

That effort could include everything from higher-quality air filtration systems to more-powerful cleaners. Every surface — including door handles, light switches, countertops, copy machine buttons, AV equipment, coffee makers, and many more — will have to be dealt with. According to Cavataio, regular offices will likely take cues from health care design. This shift could include the addition of things like copper fixtures, fabric that retains fewer germs and can more easily be cleaned, more space in kitchens and bathrooms, as well as more attention paid to how far liquids can splash. Some companies could even use UV lighting to disinfect offices at night or meeting rooms in between uses, a practice that’s increasingly common in hospitals.

Automation and voice technology could also play a role. Technology like Amazon Alexa for Business, for example, could become a new interface and remove the need for physically pushing a button or touching a surface in an office. As Bret Kinsella, founder & CEO of the voice technology publication Voicebot.ai, explained, “There is voice tech in warehouses today but very little in office settings. That will absolutely change.”

Inevitably, the most consequential way to prevent the spread of germs in an office might just be to limit the number of people allowed inside at once. Rather than having everyone work in the office from nine to five, companies might want to bring in certain teams at specific times to lessen congestion. The initial process of bringing employees back to work, at least, will probably be staggered.

“What we are anticipating is a gradual ramp-up of business as usual,” Gilpin said. “We are not expecting a flood gate of theaters and corporate spaces opening up to employees and the public. We see this as a gradual process.”

Demand for office space is uncertain

There are two conflicting trends that will affect whether or not the coronavirus leads to a sizable decrease in demand for office space.

First, fewer employees coming into the office, either due to layoffs or to an increase in working from home, could mean less need for office space.

“Social distance thinking may be part of our DNA moving forward”

As Tim Savage, a clinical assistant professor of real estate at NYU’s Schack Institute of Real Estate, put it, “As people are forced to work from home, personal space becomes an office. In a way, we’ve dramatically expanded the amount of office space we have.”

Second, safety protocols that require people to be spaced at least six feet apart could cause more demand for office space so that the people who work there aren’t as packed in as they used to be.

“In short, it is too early to tell if companies will lease less space,” Julie Whelan, Americas head of occupier research at commercial real estate services company CBRE, told Recode. “While they may need less space because some people may conduct some of their work remotely, they may also need more space to provide the social distancing that employees may feel they need to be comfortable.”

It’s possible these two trends will cancel each other out.

So far, CBRE has noted that as a result of the coronavirus and its containment measures, office leasing has slowed and vacancy rates are rising. But the company also says that office properties will be more insulated than other property types like hotels and retail.

“The impact on office [space] should not be as deep or broad as what was felt after the financial crisis,” Whelan said.

Experts say there will certainly be an acceleration of existing trends in office real estate, including a move away from traditional 10-year leases for shorter ones or for flexible or coworking space (more on that later). Still, the nature of existing office leases will likely temper upheaval in the office market.

“Those who signed 10-year leases a few years ago are legally obligated to meet the terms of those leases,” Savage, the NYU professor, said. “But this could affect expansion plans.”

Whatever happens to demand for more or less square footage, the coronavirus will likely affect the type of space people are looking for. Spaces with more private areas that might limit the spread of germs stand to become more popular, for example. And while meeting rooms will still be important, companies will likely reconsider the types of meeting rooms they want (and, by extension, question whether a meeting is necessary in person in the first place). Those new types of meeting rooms will be geared toward group projects and collaboration.

“We’re going to reevaluate face-to-face meetings: which are really important and which can be substituted,” Gensler’s Pogue-McLaurin said. “We want to reserve when we do come together to be special and important and about creating relationships — and to create social distance without feeling awkward.”

Coworking is not doomed, but it’s destined to change

Proponents of coworking spaces have long argued that companies managing flexible office space would be able to weather a recession. That’s because, while a number of clients at coworking spaces might choose to liquidate their space completely, coworking companies expect an influx of new clients looking to downsize from traditional office space with long lease terms into so-called flexible or coworking space.

What the coworking space enthusiasts didn’t anticipate was a fear — and a legitimate safety hazard — of working in close quarters to others. Coworking companies like WeWork have already seen a rapid decrease in demand as clients with month-to-month commitments have dialed back or terminated their coworking memberships due to shelter-in-place orders during the pandemic. Experts say this setback hardly signals the end of coworking. It’s probably temporary, though it may lead to the demise of some struggling coworking companies.

“We want to reserve when we do come together to be special and important and about creating relationships”

“Before this crisis, we saw a slowdown in leasing activity to flexible space operators because the sector was starting to rationalize,” CBRE’s Whelan told Recode. “It is without a doubt that the industry is feeling pressure now, as is evidenced by the headlines around lay-offs among many of the major [coworking] brands.”

Before the Covid-19 crisis, many large companies were increasingly taking advantage of the flexible terms of coworking space rather than taking on long-term leases. That’s likely to continue, perhaps even more rapidly.

The uncertainty the coronavirus brings could cause more companies to look for flexible space that can accommodate rapid changes in their needs. Coworking spaces can also provide office environments for newly remote workers who choose to work outside the office.

“If anything, this crisis highlights why flexibility is valuable for companies,” Whelan said.

However, coworking as we know it will probably have to change to survive. Coworking spaces are known for their communal areas and shared amenities like hot desks, where anyone can use an open work station — and where it’s often unclear how recently the space has been cleaned.

“Think about the little phone booths people were starting to use for calls for privacy,” Gensler’s Pogue-McLaurin noted. “If someone sneezed, you have a germ-filled little box.” (Months before the coronavirus outbreak, WeWork’s phone booths were already flagged as dangerous because they contained high levels of formaldehyde.)

In addition to heightened cleaning protocols, coworking spaces will have to rethink their vaunted — and highly profitable — use of communal space. Fitting as many people as possible into one location won’t be as acceptable as it used to be. Like with regular offices, keeping coworking spaces safe in a post-coronavirus world will probably lead to more dividers and private offices. That might also mean fewer chance encounters between people from different teams and companies — interactions that coworking companies say differentiate them from regular office real estate companies.

Fortunately for coworking companies, their growing base of enterprise clients had already been moving in that direction, leasing whole sections, floors, and even buildings from coworking companies.

“Pre-Covid, the trends were already tilted toward more private team space within those operations,” said Mark Gilbreath, CEO and founder of LiquidSpace, a platform for companies to get flexible office space.

“What will be most in demand will be spaces that offer a measure of control and privacy during the recovery, when there’s still uncertainty financially and from a health and safety perspective.”

So for those who do return to their office jobs following the coronavirus, the space will look different, and they’ll be functional for a different future. Hopefully, that will mean they’re safer, too.

"['Adam Clark Estes Shirin Ghaffary', 'Adam Clark Estes', 'Shirin Ghaffary', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-10,Apple and Google want to turn your phone into a Covid-tracking machine,"Just when you were wondering why the world’s biggest tech companies weren’t doing more to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Apple and Google made a big announcement: They are joining forces to build an opt-in contact-tracing tool using Bluetooth technology that could help public health officials track the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The new tool brings with it not only hope for a quicker end to the pandemic, but also a host of privacy and security concerns.

The contact-tracing tool Apple and Google want to create would have your smartphone log when you’ve come into close contact with other people. If one of those people later reports Covid-19 symptoms to a public health authority, your phone would receive an alert about the diagnosis. It works a bit like exchanging contact information with everyone you meet, except everything is designed to be anonymous and automatic.

Once it’s equipped with this new contact-tracing software, your smartphone will periodically exchange anonymized tracing keys with nearby devices via Bluetooth. The phone maintains a list of keys collected from people you have come in contact that with stays on your device, not a server, unless you test positive for coronavirus and report your diagnosis. If that happens, your phone will then upload those keys to a server that will send alerts to the owners of recently collected keys. The alert will not reveal who’s infected — in this example, that’s you — but it will share information for what people who were in proximity to you should do next.

Those are the broad strokes of what’s sure to be a very complex public-health-focused surveillance system. It represents an unprecedented partnership between two competing tech giants, one that could forever change the way our devices talk to each other. (Apple and Google say that the new contact-tracing tool will work between iPhones and Android phones.) The Bluetooth-based approach also draws on beacon technology that’s already in use in retail environments — and is already a concern for privacy advocates. Understanding the privacy and security implications of this new coronavirus contact-tracing technology will take time. The tool will start rolling out in May.

How it’s built

An important thing to understand about this system is that Apple and Google aren’t doing this by themselves. The two companies are building a set of tools, known as an application programming interface (API), that lets iOS and Android apps communicate with each other. The companies are also partnering with public health organizations to build apps for contact tracing, though they haven’t revealed exactly which ones are participating just yet.

In the first phase of the tool’s release, which will start around mid-May, Google and Apple will push updates to their mobile operating systems that will let iOS and Android apps become interoperable. The companies will also release the APIs so that public health authorities can then build apps that support Bluetooth-based contact tracing through the exchange of anonymized keys. People can choose to download those apps, which will be free and publicly available in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. And again, these apps will be built on updated operating systems that let iPhones and Android devices talk to each other, so contact tracing won’t be restricted if you’re near someone who has a different kind of phone. The whole system is opt-in.

The tool’s second phase will involve another update to iOS and Android which will allow the device to broadcast anonymized keys through Bluetooth without needing an app. While Apple and Google still say that users opt in to broadcast your anonymized key, the only way to opt out of having this functionality on their phone in the first place is not to download the software update at all. This might not be ideal for people who want to update their software but don’t want this functionality in their devices, but building it into the phones’ operating systems was necessary to ensure that the contact-tracing system can run 24 hours a day, rather than only when a particular app is open. Either way, if someone tests positive for the coronavirus, they must download an app to notify their recent contacts that they’ve been exposed. So it’s safe to say that the more sensitive aspects of the system are opt-in.

“This is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate, if they choose to opt in, as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities,” Apple and Google in a press release. “Privacy, transparency, and consent are of utmost importance in this effort, and we look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders.”

To protect users’ privacy, Apple and Google say they will build this system while keeping people’s identities anonymous throughout the process. That’s because the companies say they won’t build a database of who has Covid-19 and with whom those people been in contact. That information will be stored on the users’ phones only, except for the server a coronavirus-positive user uploads their status to. The cryptographic keys are temporary and anonymous, refreshing every 15 minutes. Meanwhile, both companies say they plan to release regular reports on the program’s progress.

Only public health authorities will be allowed to access the API to build these apps. Apple and Google did not respond to request for comment on which public health authorities they are working with or which expect to take advantage of the new feature, but it seems it will be limited to governing bodies only. Britain’s National Health Service is rumored to be working with the companies on its own app.

Apple and Google has released technical specifications and other details about the project in press releases. Though it will take some time to sift through these details, the tool’s announcement has definitely caught the attention of privacy experts, who broadly seem hopeful about the anonymized, decentralized nature of what Apple and Google are building.

How it works, in theory

Which brings us back to how the tool might actually work. In their announcement, Apple and Google mapped out a hypothetical scenario that does a good job of explaining the broad strokes of the contact-tracing process. It involves two people named Alice and Bob.

Alice and Bob meet each other for the first time while sitting on a bench for a brief conversation. Because they’ve installed the new Apple and Google technology, their phones exchange anonymized tracing keys (think of these as contact info files with a unique identifier instead of a person’s contact info). These keys indicate that Alice and Bob have been in contact, and because they’ve opted in to the Apple and Google contact tracing system, this exchanging of keys happens automatically.

A few days later, Bob finds out he’s positively diagnosed with Covid-19, and he updates an app with that information. With Bob’s consent, the app then sends an alert to everyone with whom Bob exchanged keys in the last 14 days. Alice is one of these folks, so she gets a notification that she’s been in contact with someone who has Covid-19. The notification also includes information about what Alice should do next, like go get tested herself.

As captivating as these drawings are, they represent a complex marriage of technology and design. That doesn’t mean that the contact-tracing system can’t work as advertised, but there are, so far, an unknown number of caveats that will come with its potential success. One big hurdle: There will have to be a widespread adoption of the technology and the apps for it to be effective — at least 60 percent, according to one study. There are also plenty of people who don’t have smartphones or the know-how to download and use new apps who won’t be participating. And there are currently major issues with the availability of testing so people can know if they have coronavirus in the first place.

How privacy matters

In announcing this new initiative, both Apple and Google have stressed that users have to consent to participate in contact tracing, that the apps won’t collect personally identifiable information, and that people who test positive aren’t identified to anyone else. Still, organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have raised privacy concerns about such contact-tracing systems — which are already being widely used in other countries such as South Korea, China, and Singapore.

“To their credit, Apple and Google have announced an approach that appears to mitigate the worst privacy and centralization risks, but there is still room for improvement,” Jennifer Granick, ACLU surveillance and cybersecurity counsel, wrote in a public statement on Friday. “We will remain vigilant moving forward to make sure any contract tracing app remains voluntary and decentralized, and used only for public health purposes and only for the duration of this pandemic.”

And that’s another looming question: Just how long will Apple and Google leave these contact-tracing tools embedded in their mobile operating systems? After all, if this technology can be used to track who you’ve been in contact with, it seems possible that it could also be coopted for commercial purposes or even for government surveillance. As Bennett Cyphers, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said to Recode, “We don’t want anything to be built into the OS that’s going to be turned on forever.”

There are also questions about the accuracy of Bluetooth. Some have worried that Bluetooth could yield false positive matches, though it’s not yet clear exactly how Apple and Google will implement the proximity features of Bluetooth LE technology. Others have raised concerns about the location accuracy of contact-tracing mobile apps in general. Furthermore, for the tool to be most effective, a plurality of people must opt in to using it. The big test of this project’s success will be how widespread the adoption of this contact-tracing tool becomes, and if that will be enough to impact the course of this pandemic’s trajectory significantly.

There’s still a lot we don’t know about how the Apple-Google tool will work in practice. We’ll learn more in the weeks to come, after the companies roll out the APIs and public health authorities start releasing contact-tracing apps. But regardless of potential drawbacks, this tool represents one of the most ambitious private-public partnerships in recent history. It’s the beginning of a new future where tech companies are injecting their resources into a public health crisis, not only leveraging their power in a tremendous way but also raising questions about how this power will change society for years to come.

Update, April 13, 2020, 6:45pm ET: This post has been updated with additional details about how the new Apple and Google software will work.

"['Rebecca Heilweil', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-13,How AI is helping find a cure for Covid-19,"Scientists are exploring every possible option for help battling the coronavirus pandemic, and artificial intelligence represents an intriguing avenue. AI has been used to search for new molecules capable of treating Covid-19, to scan through lung CTs for signs of Covid-related pneumonia, and to aid the epidemiologists who tracked the disease’s spread early on. The technology is even powering new tracking software that might help identify those walking around with a fever or catch people violating quarantine rules. But how much faith should people really have in these untested tools?

In a recent brief, Alex Engler, who studies AI at the Brookings Institution, warned that people should manage their expectations. Artificial intelligence can be helpful, he says, but it’s important to be wary of tech companies making broad, unfounded claims about what AI can do, and question whether these companies really have the data and expertise to ensure that the application of this technology is actually helpful. Ultimately, Engler argues that AI could be helpful on the margins, but it’s nowhere near ready to replace human experts in the battle against Covid-19.

Just because we’re in a pandemic doesn’t mean that some of AI’s greatest challenges — accuracy, bias, and the risk of exacerbating surveillance — have gone away. Engler warns that people need to question whether the companies touting this technology really have access to the information they would need to build it, and whether the AI is even right to address many of the problems that Covid-19 has created.

The risks of overhyped artificial intelligence aren’t new. But during a pandemic, when people are eager for quick solutions, the dangers of trusting an unproven technology are greater than ever.

The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

Rebecca Heilweil

Starting off, can you explain how artificial intelligence is being used to address the Covid-19 pandemic?

Alex Engler

I mean, that’s a really fundamental question, right? We’re seeing a huge number of claims around how AI is being used to fight or aid the fight against coronavirus, but it’s hard to tell which of those are really the valuable applications. And they fall into different categories.

Some are probably, frankly, just snake oil and might never happen. Some are maybe a good idea. But they’re brand new, and we should be pretty careful in trusting them, especially if they haven’t been robustly tested and they haven’t gotten out in the field yet. You might think about the diagnoses using X-rays or CT scans of pneumonia or coronavirus, as an example of that.

And then there are some things for which there are applications that are definitely useful. Maybe it’s helping on the margin, but not fundamentally changing the field. So some epidemiological modeling uses artificial intelligence, but it’s not the only part of the modeling software. It’s not the only thing. It’s working with subject matter experts, but it’s not an AI epidemiologist doing it all on its own. But the AI is helping on the margin ...

Rebecca Heilweil

I think a lot of people don’t necessarily understand why AI needs humans. We already have lots of health data, right? Aren’t we just building off of what we already know?

Alex Engler

That’s a great question, and it depends on the application. So basically, across the board, AI on its own is not helpful in these kinds of situations for a couple reasons. One: We don’t have endless, huge datasets about the spread of coronavirus and epidemics that are similar enough to this. So we don’t know enough to learn exclusively from historical data. And so that’s the first reason. Some of this has to come from subject matter expertise, things that we’re learning from experiments that we’re learning on a day-to-day basis.

You might also notice that a lot of the stakes of decisions are really high. What if you’re going to use AI to diagnose someone and you’re wrong? Specifically, you might be concerned about a false negative. That is, you say someone is healthy when they, in fact, have coronavirus. That’s a pretty enormous mistake to make, and we want to be really careful when we give AI too much influence in situations like that.

That’s the same sort of concern we have with the CT scan approach. We might be able to diagnose coronavirus with a CT scan at some point in the future, but the methods aren’t robust enough yet. We’re not sure they work well enough yet.

Another example is if you’re looking at fever-detection, and you want to see whether people have fevers using thermal imaging. You can be wrong the other way: You could think people have fevers, and they don’t. And based on that, you’re going let AI keep people out of a grocery store or an airport?

Rebecca Heilweil

What’s the worst example of artificial intelligence that’s been touted in response to Covid-19? You called it snake oil.

Alex Engler

I think the worst examples come not only from claims that are difficult to believe but also those that have subtle and pernicious side effects. A lot of the time, AI has second-order consequences that can be easy to forget about.

So some people have suggested — a little bit of news coverage, a little bit of corporate claims — that if you attach various sensors to drones, you can detect all sorts of things. The most ridiculous claims I saw were that drones could not only do thermal imaging to detect whether they have a fever but also get a sense of respiratory rate and heart rate from a drone.

Maybe that's possibly true, but I have a very hard time believing it for some of the reasons I’ve already talked about. What’s worse is that it also justifies a substantial surveillance opportunity, a mechanism of a surveillance state. That’s where you really run into problems where you might justify a new level of surveillance that’s imposing in public spaces, that maybe affects people’s behavior, and that still can’t do the task that the AI is claiming it can do.

So that’s probably the worst example, the one that makes me the most concerned. But there are different mechanisms, different ways to be concerned about this. The mortality rate predictions make me the most concerned for bias, for instance, and that’s a very different perspective on what’s potentially harmful.

Rebecca Heilweil

Most people have heard that AI can be biased and that it can be discriminatory based on race or gender or other factors. Can you explain what that AI bias might look like in a pandemic?

Alex Engler

One of the most important examples of AI bias that we’ve seen is the case of the Optum algorithm, which was a health care algorithm used by Optum, the data analytics subsidiary of UnitedHealthcare that’s used to determine the risk of future health care needs.

What researchers discovered when they got access to the Optum algorithm was that it was very biased against African Americans for reasons that weren’t relevant to health, that were more relevant to finances and socio-economic status. Through both automated decisions and human-made decisions, they basically argued for less care for black Americans.

When you see that type of system, your default should be: There are biases in them until you rigorously evaluate them to show that they’re not there. Probably you will find some, and probably you would have to do some mitigation.

So in the case of these early algorithms that people are using to evaluate the mortality risk of Covid-19, the likelihood that there are subtle biases is very high, especially when you look at things like different biological characteristics, things called biomarkers. These might help you guess who is more likely to be seriously ill, but they can also be very misleading in terms of unaccounted-for signals.

So men, for instance, are more likely to be smokers, and they also show higher mortality risk. But if you didn’t account for the fact that they were smoking or that there’s smoking in their medical history, your algorithm might show that all men are more at risk, and thus, all men are going to get prioritized for care — hypothetically.

You have to be concerned if you’re going to roll out these mortality-risk algorithms, which, for the record, can work and are valuable. But you’d have to be concerned about rolling them out so quickly that they include these sorts of pernicious biases in something so important and so high-risk as health care allocation.

Rebecca Heilweil

Is there an application of this that sticks out to you as the most promising application of artificial intelligence that’s being used to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic?

Alex Engler

I’m hopeful about two efforts. One is AlphaFold, which is Deep Mind’s protein-folding initiative. It is possible that those protein structure estimations are helpful for creating vaccines and also treatments. To Deep Mind’s credit, they did this immediately once they got the genetic makeup of Covid-19. They did estimations, and they publicly released those models. So it is possible — and I think it is very much worth keeping an eye on — that this effort might speed the development of a vaccine or a therapeutic antibody that helps undermine the damage of the virus. It’s a little too early to tell. These are estimations, and these predictions need to be experimentally validated, but this is a new development. It could be one that’s very meaningful.

There’s another effort to analyze the research about Covid-19 — one that’s an emerging area of AI — that involves using AI to analyze large amounts of academic papers. Because there are so many papers, the pure amount of academic research being created, especially in fields like biomedicine, makes it very hard for anyone to read all of them or even to find all the ones that are relevant. So there are some people taking a very large database of papers and seeing what they can discover about them.

I am hedged in my optimism here. I think this could do some useful things, like make it easier for researchers to find relevant papers and to categorize papers. I think it’s unlikely that our vaccines, our solutions, or our core understanding of Covid-19 will come from that. But it could help in meaningful ways to organize what we know.

For the record, I think that in time, with less of an absurd turnaround period, you can see AI meaningfully help in medical imagery. There’s tons of good news around AI and medical imagery. Maybe it can tell the difference between bacterial pneumonia and the pneumonia that’s associated with Covid-19. Maybe with really good thermal imaging, it can get closer to fever detection. It’s not that these things are fundamentally impossible tasks. It’s that it’s worth approaching them with a skeptical, informed take rather than just taking the idea on its face, “Of course, AI can do that.”

"['Peter Kafka', 'Apr']",2020-04-13,What went wrong with the media’s coronavirus coverage?,"The coronavirus pandemic has crippled America. So far, the virus has killed more than 20,000 people in the United States and has sickened more than 500,000 people.

It’s clear now that the US government was woefully unprepared for the pandemic, and that’s been reflected in its messaging to the public since the start.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for instance, didn’t tell the country to stop gathering in groups until March 15 — weeks after a top CDC official announced that the virus would begin spreading throughout the US. And after telling Americans for months that they should not wear masks unless they are sick, the government formally flipped that advice on April 3 and said that everyone should wear some kind of covering on their face in certain public settings.

Much of the mainstream media amplified this slow and muddled reaction to the rapidly spreading virus. Since alarming reports about Covid-19 began to emerge from China in January, the media often provided information to Americans that later proved to be wrong, or at least inadequate.

For instance: While President Trump has been correctly pilloried for describing the coronavirus as less dangerous than the flu, that message was commonplace in mainstream media outlets throughout February. And journalists — including my colleagues at Vox — were dutifully repeating exhortations from public health officials not to wear masks for much of 2020.

As we head into the next phase of the pandemic, and as the stakes mount, it’s worth looking back to ask how the media could have done better as the virus broke out of China and headed to the US.

Why didn’t we see this coming sooner? And once we did, why didn’t we sound the alarm with more vigor?

If you read the stories from that period, not just the headlines, you’ll find that most of the information holding the pieces together comes from authoritative sources you’d want reporters to turn to: experts at institutions like the World Health Organization, the CDC, and academics with real domain knowledge.

The problem, in many cases, was that that information was wrong, or at least incomplete. Which raises the hard question for journalists scrutinizing our performance in recent months: How do we cover a story where neither we nor the experts we turn to know what isn’t yet known? And how do we warn Americans about the full range of potential risks in the world without ringing alarm bells so constantly that they’ll tune us out?

“Not just saying what we do know, but what we don’t know”

Let’s be clear: Journalists have been doing crucial reporting about what the US government got wrong as the pandemic advanced, and what US leaders could have done to prepare America. They provided analysis that put the news in context. And they have also provided important on-the-ground dispatches from places around the world that have been devastated by the disease — often at great personal risk — starting at its epicenter in Wuhan, China.

But when it came to grappling with a new disease they knew nothing about, journalists most often turned to experts and institutions for information, and relayed what those experts and institutions told them to their audience.

And given that the Covid-19 coronavirus is brand new, even the best-meaning experts and institutions gave conflicting information, some of which now has proven to be inaccurate or up for debate. That includes National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, who is now the most trusted official in the federal government when it comes to the Covid-19 response, but as late as February was calling the risk from coronavirus “minuscule” and warning people to worry instead about “influenza outbreak, which is having its second wave.”

“There’s a line between doing aggressive reporting and acting in the role of a public health agency”

“There’s a line between doing aggressive reporting and kind of acting in the role of a public health agency,” Joe Kahn, the New York Times’s managing editor, told Recode. “And you never have a degree of complete certainty about the medical analysis, and the epidemiology.”

That degree of uncertainty is much larger when it comes to a new virus that moves around the world as quickly as a plane. It’s a problem that comes built into the reporting. Perhaps the only solution journalists have is to simply say: The experts we talked to aren’t sure, but they’re trying to find out.

Laura Helmuth, who was the health and science editor at the Washington Post and recently left to become editor-in-chief of Scientific American, says acknowledging gaps in knowledge is crucial but not easy.

“One thing that science journalists have been getting better at is not just saying what we do know, but what we don’t know,” she says. “But most journalists aren’t accustomed to doing that.”

And that assumes the journalists themselves have the expertise to ask the right experts. Mainstream journalists who know how to read and understand academic research reports are a select group and have been for decades. Many midsize newspapers once employed dedicated science journalists, but those jobs have been dwindling for years. (One reason that Stat, a publication that launched in 2015, which specializes in medical and science reporting, has been so valuable during this crisis is that it employs dozens of expert journalists who once did this work for other outlets.)

But Zeynep Tufekci, a professor at the University of North Carolina’s School of Information and Library Science who specializes in the intersection between technology and society, argues that the mainstream media should have been able to understand the threat facing the country much earlier.

Writing in the Atlantic on March 24, she says the threat should have been obvious as early as January 29, when a New England Journal of Medicine paper described the virus’s speed, cunning, and lethality. Tufekci shared the paper on Twitter and said that “with an urgent enormous effort, this could be contained.” But back then, widespread lockdowns and enforced social distancing for everyone regardless of their symptoms were hard to imagine, even for Tufekci. “For all of us, washing hands often and not touching one’s face and self-isolating if feverish are the sensible steps—as in any flu season,” she tweeted.

Significant #nCoV2019 paper *just* out at @NEJM. Bad news, which we kinda knew, is there is sustained human-to-human transmission. Goodish news: R0 estimate is 2.2, lower than SARS. But won't be easier to contain because 2020 is more connected than 2003. https://t.co/IsvnOvs8uU — zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) January 29, 2020

Tufekci’s critique is that many journalists who covered the outbreak in the first couple of months of the year weren’t analytical enough: “Thus from the end of January through most of February, a soothing message got widespread traction, not just with Donald Trump and his audience, but among traditional media in the United States, which exhorted us to worry about the flu instead, and warned us against overreaction. It seemed sensible, grown-up, and responsible.”

Some of that advice shows up in memes that highlight headlines from a range of respected media outlets that now seem terribly misleading after new information came to light. (You won’t find any Vox headlines in the collage below on flu comparisons, but as many people have pointed out, my colleagues at Vox published some stories and tweets with similar angles.)

But, again: Those stories didn’t just materialize out of reporters’ heads. They were informed by experts trying to make sense of something they hadn’t seen before.

For instance, Maimuna Majumder, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School, told BuzzFeed News in late January — in a story originally titled “Don’t Worry About The Coronavirus. Worry About The Flu” — that some worst-case projections about the disease’s velocity were “absolutely premature and hyperbolic.”

A January 29 piece from Axios explained, “Why we panic about coronavirus, but not the flu.” It quoted an infectious diseases physician at the University of Nebraska, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, and a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University to make the argument that the flu should be Americans’ real concern.

The same was true for a much-discussed Recode piece from February 13 that looked at the way Silicon Valley was responding to the virus. That story relied on information from the CDC as well as an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, who said that “the chances are astonishingly low that you would come into contact with a coronavirus infection” at work or in a public setting. Building on those interviews, it repeated the argument that “the fact remains that, so far, the flu has impacted far more people.” Though true at the time, this clearly missed where the virus was headed.

But even now, months after we first learned about the virus, scientists are still learning the nitty-gritty of how it spreads and the extent to which it lingers in airborne droplets and aerosols that can infect others. That makes it hard to answer a question like, “can you contract the virus just by breathing in the same space as someone who’s infected?” We don’t know the full answer and may not for some time, and that’s why the institutions that employ these experts have been giving journalists and the public contradictory advice along the way.

That back-and-forth can be jarring, even if we’ve become accustomed to continual contradictions from our government leaders. The Trump administration has conditioned Americans to a reality where the president routinely announces something in the morning, backtracks it shortly afterward, and later pretends he never said it. So when he does say something, it’s pored over immediately to check for falsehoods and (usually) treated with appropriate skepticism.

You can argue that American newsrooms should use the same kind of scrutiny when it comes to pronouncements from institutions — including ones like the CDC, which generally don’t make news. But it’s not a stance Americans are used to seeing, particularly in the middle of a catastrophe, when people want reassurance and guidance.

An obvious but important point: All of the coverage we’re discussing here doesn’t include Fox News and the rest of the pro-Trump media infrastructure, because it would be unrealistic to expect useful coverage from that infrastructure. With the narrow exception of Tucker Carlson, that apparatus simply provided an echo chamber and feedback loop for Trump’s messaging, so that when Trump said he expected the virus to “miraculously” disappear, they said the same, and when he said it was time to take it seriously, they did the same. This did a deadly disservice to an enormous swath of the country, which takes its cues from those outlets. But it’s not surprising. “Misinformation from the Trump administration is the biggest challenge,” Helmuth says. “Really good reporters are wasting a ton of time refuting misinformation from the White House.”

“In a fundamental way, news is bad at communicating risk”

But even if you’re inclined to give the media a pass for its performance before the pandemic hit the US, what about the second phase? When we knew it was coming and that it would be bad?

You can’t argue that Americans had mixed messaging by that point: On February 25, CDC official Nancy Messonnier told reporters that she expected to see the coronavirus appear in the US via “community spread” — meaning people would become infected without knowingly coming into contact with other infected people — and that “disruption to everyday life might be severe.”

But even after that, worrisome news about the spread and effects of the virus, which was moving across Asia and showing up in Europe, competed with coverage of the Democratic primary and other stories of the moment, like Harvey Weinstein’s sentencing for sexual assault. And stories that did cover the virus often focused on the Trump administration’s moves — like his decision to put Mike Pence (theoretically) in charge of a virus response team — instead of plainly telling Americans that they could be facing huge death tolls and a devastated economy.

“I think people were worried about being alarmist,” MSNBC host Chris Hayes told Recode. But Hayes also says that figuring out the right degree of alarm to sound is a basic problem for journalists.

“In a fundamental, definitional way, news is bad at communicating risk,” he said. Telling you about a plane crash is news, but it doesn’t convey the risk of flying — it overstates it, by giving it prominence. The same with local crime stories. Meanwhile, telling you about a pandemic that’s about to overtake the country, kill tens of thousands of people, and crater the economy is very hard to do when it hasn’t happened yet, but there’s a chance it could.

This core challenge for journalists won’t go away after the pandemic: There are always going to be threats that could eventually lead to disaster, but most of them don’t. If we holler every time we see one, we’ll be wrong and no one will listen to us. If we don’t holler when there’s a real one, we will have let down our audience.

I first started poking a few weeks ago at the idea of whether the mainstream media should have been more alarmist about the coronavirus sooner. When I talked to Brian Stelter, CNN’s media reporter, on March 10, he told me he didn’t want to cause “undue fear” in his coverage, and that extended to the way he edited the on-air chyrons that ran during his Reliable Sources show.

For instance, Stelter said at the time that he was stripping out the word “deadly” whenever he saw the phrase “deadly virus.”

“Everyone knows it’s a deadly virus,” he said. “You don’t have to call it ‘deadly virus’ every time. It’s a virus. We don’t call the flu the ‘deadly flu.’”

As Stelter noted, a lot of this comes down to packaging: How and when do you communicate the most important news to people, and how do you balance the need to not scare them prematurely with the need to scare them into action?

“Anything you say in advance of a pandemic seems alarmist. Anything that you’ve done after it starts is inadequate.”

“The media should be screaming about it,” says Laura Helmuth. “They should be saying that the states that don’t have stay-at-home orders are killing people, that politicizing this is killing people.”

In some cases, the screaming was there, but you had to work to hear it. You wouldn’t find it in a headline or the top of a newscast, but if you absorbed the whole thing, you’d find news that would scare you into some kind of action.

My sort-of come-to-Jesus moment started on February 27 when I listened to Times reporter Donald McNeil on the paper’s Daily podcast. He said the worst-case scenario was a repeat of the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed 50 million people worldwide and at least 675,000 in the United States.

In that version, McNeil said calmly: Everybody in the US would “know somebody who dies.”

It’s most gripping in audio form, but I want to pull out a section here:

Donald G. McNeil Jr.

Some big chunk of the country — 30, 40, 50 percent — are likely to get a new virus when it blows through. And if you don’t get it in the first wave, you might get it in the second wave. Michael Barbaro

And 2 percent lethality rate of 50 percent of the country. I don’t want to do that math. It’s really, really awful. McNeil

It’s a lot of people. It means, you know, you don’t die, 80 percent of people have mild cases. But you know somebody who dies. Barbaro

That’s pretty horrible … Okay. Now, the best-case scenario. McNeil

The best-case scenario is one of these drugs works, and basically everybody gets sick next year, but everybody who is hospitalized gets a drug that keeps them from dying and keeps them from going into deep, deep, deep respiratory distress. And we have the equivalent of a bad flu season. And then everybody says, ‘Oh, the media, they blew it out of proportion again.’ You know, it’s all ridiculous. And, you know, I get blamed.

That was enough for me — sort of. I didn’t change my plans to travel to Los Angeles the following week, but I did start assuming that the rest of my spring plans were going to be up in the air. And I told my family that we should start buying food — not in panic, but slowly. And I wondered how The Daily’s millions of listeners would respond.

But, again, if you just scanned the title of that day’s Daily episode, you might not realize that a New York Times reporter was projecting that the best-case scenario for America was that “everybody gets sick” over the next year but could be saved from serious illness via yet-to-be-developed drugs. And that the worst case was more American deaths than we suffered in World War II. That Title: “The Coronavirus Goes Global.”

The truth is, there’s no good answer to this. You can be as diligent about your sourcing as possible and still get it wrong if the experts you talk to get it wrong. And you can err on the side of not scaring people, when scaring people into action may be the only thing that saves their lives. I don’t know that we’ll do better next time, and we may just have to live with it — no matter how early the warnings are.

Let’s end by traveling back in time to January 27, to watch an exchange you probably didn’t see when it aired: CNBC’s Brian Sullivan interviewing former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who was also the head of the Department of Health and Human Services from 2005 to 2009.

Leavitt was arguing that if the coronavirus made it to the US, it would be nearly impossible to confine it. But you can see Sullivan struggling, in real time, with how much fear to strike in his audience.

Mike Leavitt

There will be a period of time, if this starts to spread, where people will need to change their behavior. These will be the same kind of provisions that every family, every business, every community, every employer, needs to be thinking about, not just for a pandemic virus but for many kinds of emergencies. Brian Sullivan

But we also have to walk, I would imagine, that very fine and difficult line, Governor, which is: You don’t want to scare people unnecessarily. We do have five cases. Nobody is minimizing any of those five cases or what is happening. But you also don’t want to create a situation where people may begin to act irrational. Leavitt

[Pause] So here’s the problem. Anything you say in advance of a pandemic seems alarmist. Anything that you’ve done after it starts is inadequate.

""Anything you say in advance of a pandemic seems alarmist. Anything that you've done after it starts is inadequate,"" says @GovMikeLeavitt. Listen to the rest of his interivew to learn whether or not the U.S. is prepared to handle #Coronavirus on @CNBC. pic.twitter.com/6GdBWKIPtY — The Exchange (@CNBCTheExchange) January 27, 2020

"['Sara Morrison', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-10,Ford and GM are making tens of thousands of ventilators. It may already be too late.,"A newfound need for ventilators has made interesting partners out of medical device makers and car manufacturers. The two industries have recently combined forces to rapidly mass produce ventilators and fill any shortages that may arise due to the coronavirus pandemic. On April 8, after weeks of dithering, the Trump administration ordered 30,000 ventilators from General Motors (GM) under the Defense Production Act (DPA) for the Strategic National Stockpile, which would quadruple its existing supply. The same day, reports emerged that some doctors were questioning using ventilators on some coronavirus patients at all.

The country’s ventilator shortage has quickly become a complex and nuanced debate. Some fear that the herculean effort by automakers won’t put enough ventilators in hospitals in time. Others point out that increasing the ventilator supply only saves lives if there are enough beds, medication, and health professionals to treat patients who need them. The FDA has temporarily loosened restrictions on who can make critical care ventilators and which devices can be used for critically ill coronavirus patients, which has made them easier to produce. But that doesn’t completely solve the problem — and it may even create other problems. It doesn’t help that President Trump is now using ventilators as a form of political patronage.

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that the concurrent need for ventilators in the United States will peak at about 17,000 on April 14, though the actual number could fall anywhere within a range of about 8,000 to 35,500. It’s estimated that we have about 170,000 ventilators in the country, but that doesn’t mean there will be enough wherever they’re most needed. The Strategic National Stockpile has a ventilator supply that’s meant to fill any shortages, but the tens of thousands of ventilators now being manufactured to address that shortage won’t be ready for months.

The delay isn’t for lack of trying. The medical device industry just wasn’t built to make this many machines this quickly. It’s never had to before: This is the first time we’ve needed to use any of the stockpile’s ventilators.

“If you’re a ventilator manufacturer right now and somebody wants to make 50,000 of your ventilators, that’s more than you would typically sell in five or six years,” Rich Branson, a registered respiratory therapist and professor at the University of Cincinnati, told Recode.

While GM’s efforts are perhaps the more widely known thanks to Trump’s recent Twitter tirade criticizing them, he’s also mentioned Ford, telling the company to “get going on ventilators.” Tesla has also expressed an interest in producing ventilators, as have car companies in other countries, such as Rolls Royce and Jaguar in the United Kingdom. These have drawn comparisons to wartime efforts by car companies — including Ford and GM — to produce tanks and airplanes out of their car factories during WWII. It’s so far unclear whether the results of these efforts will have the same sort of world-changing effects.

GM’s portable ventilators don’t reinvent the wheel

Car companies have large factories, mass production experience, and connections to supply chains needed for the hundreds of parts that go into a ventilator. But repurposing a car factory to make a medical device as complex as a ventilator isn’t easy.

GM is taking a streamlined approach by making Ventec’s existing VOCSN ventilator model, which is cleared by the FDA to fill the critical care needs like those faced by coronavirus patients. Initially, a stripped-down version of the VOCSN, called the V+Pro, will be produced that uses fewer parts and can be done sooner. Ventec’s ventilators are small and portable. They include the features needed for critically ill patients but are cheaper, easier to use, and faster to build than typical ICU ventilators.

“Rather than recreating the wheel and trying to build something from the ground up, let’s take what we know works, and find a partner who can help us scale that more quickly,” Chris Brooks, chief strategy officer of Ventec Life Systems, told Recode.

GM’s Kokomo, Indiana, factory was chosen for the effort because it already does advanced electronic work that lends itself well to producing these ventilators. The plant only has about 300 employees, so the company will also be making new hires for the effort, for which it ultimately hopes to have 1,000 people. If nothing else, the effort will provide work for several hundred people during a time of unprecedented mass unemployment.

A process that would normally take “many, many months or even years,” Brooks said, has been compressed into a few weeks. Ventec and GM have been working “flat-out” since their talks began in mid-March, but it takes time to secure a supply chain, create new molds and tools, and train workers. GM anticipates it will build a few hundred ventilators by the end of April, and the company is set to deliver its first batch of about 6,000 ventilators to the stockpile by June 1. The rest will arrive by the end of August.

The order for the stockpile will also cost the federal government nearly $490 million. But that’s not even the biggest ventilator contract in the works: The HHS also announced on April 8 that it will pay Phillips $647 million for 2,500 ventilators for the stockpile by the end of May and 43,000 by the end of the year. You might remember Phillips as the company the government once contracted to build 10,000 ventilators for the stockpile at a cost of $13.8 million. Those ventilators never arrived. The Department of Defense’s Defense Logistics Agency has also purchased 8,000 ventilators from four different companies for $84 million. And Trump has asked the HHS to use the DPA to procure ventilators from Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed, Vyaire, and General Electric (GE), though contracts with those companies have not yet been announced.

Ford teams up with GE Healthcare to make even simpler ventilators

Though it doesn’t have an order from the government yet, GE Healthcare has already teamed up with Ford to lay the foundations of a plan to produce 50,000 ventilators by July. The partnership will produce ventilators licensed from Airon, a small company that used to sell 50 ventilators a month at best.

Typically used in transport situations, the Model A is FDA-cleared and has an Emergency Use Authorization from the agency for use on coronavirus patients. It’s a simple device, down to its power source: gas, rather than electricity or battery. Whereas your typical $50,000 ICU ventilator will have a large touchscreen and a computer that controls, monitors, and records all aspects of a patient’s breathing, the Airon ventilator is controlled by switches and dials and has an analog meter in lieu of a digital display.

The benefit of such simplicity is that many of these ventilators can be made quickly, as they require fewer parts. While the most complicated critical care ventilators have well over 1,000 parts, the Airon has between 250 and 300, according to the Washington Post. The stripped-down Ventec model that GM is producing, by comparison, has just over 400. GE Healthcare told the Post that it consulted with experts and clinicians who have treated coronavirus patients who said the Airon model meets the needs of patients who only require a “simplified, more basic ventilator.” But some experts disagree.

“I give Ford credit,” Branson, the respiratory therapist, said. “They went in, and they realized this thing’s really not very expensive, it doesn’t have very many parts, and the parts that are in it are pretty simple, so probably easy to scale up in a hurry. But if you’re going to have to distribute it with a disclaimer that says, ‘Don’t use on the really sick people,’ that is going to be a real problem.”

Branson was part of the Task Force on Mass Critical Care, which created guidelines more than a decade ago for stockpile ventilators in the case of a pandemic. The Airon model does not fill all of that criteria, Branson said. (Branson is also a member of Ventec’s Clinical Board and worked with Ventec to develop the VOCSN.)

Ford will initially produce the ventilators in Airon’s Florida plant, which can currently make as many as three ventilators per day. By April 20, Ford says it will have started production out of one of its own plants in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The company hopes this will allow 500 workers to make as many as 30,000 per month. Earlier, Ford and GE announced they would collaborate to produce a simplified GE ventilator, but the companies haven’t released details about that venture yet.

With thousands of them scheduled to arrive by the summer, the Airon ventilators could prove useful as the peak of the pandemic hits certain parts of the United States — not to mention other countries that will likely also need ventilators once America’s surge has passed. As is the case with GM, however, the Ford and GE Healthcare partnership will only produce several hundred ventilators by the end of April, missing the expected mid-April peak in places like New York, Louisiana, and California.

Tesla plans to repurpose its car parts as the DIY crowd gets creative

Outside of Detroit, there are myriad efforts to produce ventilators through even less-traditional avenues. In late March, the FDA loosened some restrictions on ventilators, saying it wouldn’t enforce certain regulations for the duration of the pandemic, paving the way for ventilator prototypes built by anyone from large companies to medical residents. While it’s possible some of these headline-grabbing efforts could be used to treat coronavirus patients, that seems unlikely.

Elon Musk made a much-publicized jump into the ventilator fray with a March 18 tweet that Tesla would “make ventilators” in the case of a shortage. He later said Tesla’s Buffalo, New York, factory would produce Medtronic machines. But it has yet to do so, and when Medtronic was asked about the status of the project, a spokesperson would only say that another Musk company, SpaceX, was making a subcomponent valve used in its ventilators. Tesla did not respond to request for comment.

Tesla is also designing its own model. The company recently released a video of a prototype made largely out of Tesla car parts, the idea there being that it wouldn’t take any parts away from actual ventilator manufacturers. Even the monitor is Tesla: a touchscreen powered by the car’s infotainment system. As intriguing as the design seems, Tesla has not said when, if ever, it expects this model to go into production.

Tesla’s homegrown ventilator is similar to the cottage industry of DIY efforts that has cropped up over the last several weeks. Some come from engineers and doctors who want to build entirely new devices, like this open source design from Vanderbilt University or MIT’s “E-Vent” project. Others aim to adapt existing ventilators to be more effective during the pandemic. Engineers from the University of South Carolina and Prisma Health’s VESper, for instance, are sharing plans for a 3D-printed device that can allow one ventilator to be used on two patients. Massachusetts General Hospital anesthesia residents are also hosting the CoVent-19 Challenge, a contest for “rapidly deployable ventilator” designs.

Over in the United Kingdom, there’s vacuum cleaner and fan company Dyson. Like Tesla, it designed its own ventilator prototype. The British government has already ordered 10,000 of them, but the design does not yet have regulatory approval despite the process being fast-tracked. It also appears that Dyson’s ventilators will miss the UK’s peak week, assuming they are ever produced at all. There’s even an effort to bring back the iron lung.

“I hear people say about the devices that people are trying to make in their garage: ‘well, it’s better than nothing,’” Branson says. “Well, not really. And people say, ‘well, it can be used on people who aren’t so sick.’ The patients who aren’t so sick aren’t going on a ventilator.”

Ventilators alone will never be enough

Some may see these options as better than nothing. Others don’t.

“I think the reality is, with Covid patients, they need a true critical care ventilator that’s powerful and precise,” Brooks, the Ventec executive, said. “If you don’t have the right ventilator for these patients, they’re just not going to survive.”

Dr. Ken Lyn-Kew, a pulmonologist at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado, was even more blunt, telling Time magazine that the prospect of treating patients with ventilators that weren’t up to critical care standards was “terrifying.”

There’s also a growing backlash against ventilators of any kind. Recent articles in Stat, NPR, and the Associated Press say that some medical professionals are starting to think that ventilators are overused for coronavirus patients, with some people being put on them before all other, less-invasive options have been exhausted. A higher-than-average mortality rate for coronavirus patients put on ventilators may also show that they can make things worse in certain cases. The AP reported a mortality rate of 40 to 50 percent for non-coronavirus patients in severe respiratory distress versus a rate of 80 percent for coronavirus patients in New York City hospitals. Put simply: Even a top-of-the-line, full-featured, critical care ventilator doesn’t guarantee that a patient will recover from coronavirus — far from it.

None of these challenges even begin to address the need for medical professionals to run these machines and care for the patients on them. That’s a round-the-clock job that requires specific expertise, from inserting the tube to managing and monitoring oxygen flow to removing lung secretions (the mucus you’d cough up in a normal situation, basically). It also requires drugs to keep the patient sedated while intubated, and those are now in short supply as well.

Again, recent projections put the peak concurrent ventilator usage at 17,000 on April 14. Experts also predict coronavirus patients will need about 20,000 ICU beds that day — and that we will be 9,000 ICU beds short. So it won’t matter how many ventilators we have if we also don’t have enough of everything else.

“All the ventilators in the world aren’t sufficient if you don’t have beds for the patients to be in, nurses to care for them, respiratory therapists to run the ventilator, and doctors to determine the best path of care,” Branson — who literally wrote the book on respiratory care equipment — said. “If, somehow, Elon Musk did invent the greatest ventilator in the world, and he could make them all by Friday afternoon, and he sent a million of them to New York, that wouldn’t solve this problem ... I understand we focused on the ventilator, but we focused on it too much.”

Whatever their drawbacks, ventilators do save lives. It would be a moral failing if we didn’t address this shortage, even in the face of discouraging odds. That in mind, it’s laudable that companies like Ford and GM are taking wartime-like measures to manufacture ventilators as fast as they possibly can. In any case, these ventilators are a stop-gap measure. But they aren’t a cure.

“Social distancing is the most important part in all of this,” Branson added. “And, of course, either a drug or a vaccine is really the solution.”

"['Jason Del Rey', 'Apr']",2020-04-10,Amazon was already powerful. The coronavirus pandemic cleared the way to dominance.,"Covid-19 has transformed the world, killing nearly 100,000 people across the globe so far and sending the US economy into a tailspin.

Along with the restaurant and travel sectors in the US, the retail industry has been hit especially hard. While grocery stores and online retailers have been deemed essential and continue to operate, department store chains and other “nonessential” retailers, big and small, have been forced to close up shop.

Those closures are dealing potentially catastrophic blows to cash reserves and accelerating trends in consumer behavior that could spell doom for large swaths of brick-and-mortar retail and the 16 million people the industry employs. Nearly 1 million retail workers were furloughed in a single week recently, according to the Washington Post, and more than 250,000 stores have been shuttered, according to GlobalData Retail. Some analysts predict 15,000 retail stores will close permanently this year, which would mark a 60 percent increase from last year’s record closures.

But not every retailer is suffering. For Walmart and Amazon, which already dominated a significant percentage of brick-and-mortar retail and online commerce in the US, respectively, the pandemic has provided an exponential boost to their already substantial businesses and power. Google searches for Amazon are at near-holiday-season levels; in-store sales at Walmart skyrocketed in March; and together both companies are hiring 250,000 new workers. Meanwhile, more and more people are switching to online shopping and grocery delivery and pickup — and they may not revert to their old habits when the pandemic ends.

“My first thought is the number of people who work in retail and have had careers in retail that may not have the same job or even companies to go back to,” said Matt Kaness, a former Walmart and Urban Outfitters executive who is now executive chairman and interim CEO of Lucky Brand, the denim retailer.

As foot traffic to non-grocery retail stores declined more than 97 percent during the last two weeks in March, Walmart store sales rose 20 percent for much of March over the same period last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company has said it is looking to hire 150,000 new workers by the end of May.

“Who’s going to survive this? Well, you know Amazon has money in the bank.”

And then there’s Amazon, which already accounted for nearly 40 percent of all US online retail sales — that’s around eight times more than its next competitor, Walmart. Before the pandemic, the US e-commerce industry only represented between 10 percent and 15 percent of overall retail. Now, that percentage seems likely to grow, setting up Amazon to have a bigger advantage over most other retailers, including Walmart.

With millions of Americans ordered to remain home, Amazon is now, more than ever, a lifeline for essentials for millions of people rather than just a convenient option for online shopping. Consumer spending on Amazon is up 35 percent from the same period last year, according to estimates from Facteus, a firm that analyzes more than 30 million daily payment card transactions to offer consumer spending insights to retailers and financial institutions. The labor numbers also reflect the company’s growth; Amazon has hired 80,000 new workers in the past few weeks alone.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s company already faced intense scrutiny from lawmakers, regulators, and worker rights groups before the pandemic because of business practices some deem anticompetitive and what some workers say is a punishing pace of work at its warehouses. Still, it would have been hard to imagine that Amazon would expand its power exponentially over just two months, but the exponential spread of this pandemic has done it. The question is: At what cost?

“When this is over, I think this could be the biggest boon ever to Amazon,” David Kahan, the US CEO of shoe brand Birkenstock, told Recode. “Who’s going to survive this? Well, you know Amazon has money in the bank.”

“This is not something that capitalism drove”

The novel coronavirus is not discriminating in who it infects, but local governments’ response has, out of necessity, discriminated against different retailers and their employees.

In North America, the apparel, fashion, and beauty industry generates approximately $600 billion in annual revenue and employs more than 4 million people, according to McKinsey . Macy’s, Gap, and J.C. Penney have furloughed around 300,000 workers, sending them home without pay but keeping them on their health care plans. Executives at these companies say they don’t know when their stores might reopen, and analysts believe it’s possible some current locations never will.

“They had the rug pulled out from under them and are unfairly disadvantaged, while their competitors, like Amazon, Walmart, and arguably Target are allowed to stay open and widen their lead,” said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester research. (Target announced that sales through much of March were up 20 percent over last year.) “This is incredibly unfair; this is not something that capitalism drove. And it not only hurts them in the near term, but it also has really long-term, lasting repercussions that they have to climb out of and others don’t.”

For department stores like Sears and J.C. Penney that were already on the brink of closure, the coronavirus could be the final nail. For others like Macy’s and Kohl’s, whose situations weren’t previously great but not quite as dire, extended closures could lead to a cash squeeze within five to eight months and potential defaults on loans, according to analysts at Cowen Research. To get ahead of the situations, permanent store closures and layoffs are plausible. The federal government has boosted unemployment pay by $600 a week for four months, meaning many furloughed retail store employees will get their full pay during that time frame. But will their job still exist when the economy reopens?

“I am really concerned,” said Kaness, of Lucky Brand. “I tend to focus on the human element first, and there’s going to be a lot of people that have to get re-skilled and retrained and readjust how they think about the rest of their careers.”

“We all know they needed to be right-sized at some point,” Kahan, of Birkenstock, added about department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s, “and ... this virus might be the revolution to cause it. If it is, you have a lot of people out there that could become Amazon warehouse [and] Amazon [delivery] workers. It’s like you are running out of points of distribution. How many places are a conduit to the end consumer?”

“There’s going to be a lot of people that have to get re-skilled and retrained and readjust how they think about the rest of their careers”

Amazon and Walmart are set to benefit from the pandemic — in terms of both sales and expanding their labor forces. But both companies’ labor practices have come under fire in the past, and the pressures of the pandemic are intensifying these debates, particularly for Amazon. Warehouse workers at both companies have said their employers have not been transparent enough about Covid-19 cases in their facilities and have been too slow to issue them protective gear.

Last week, workers at a Walmart e-commerce warehouse in Pennsylvania told a local news site that at least nine of their colleagues had tested positive for Covid-19 but that the retailer was not taking the situation seriously enough. After the publication contacted Walmart with questions, the company temporarily closed down the facility.

For Amazon, the health crisis and the surge it created in online shopping have only exacerbated the company’s labor issues. Before, Amazon labor critics focused mainly on what some characterize as a brutal pace of work at the company’s facilities. Now, some workers across its network have argued the company isn’t adequately protecting its warehouse and delivery workers who are risking their lives to keep its business running.

Attendance at Amazon facilities has fallen as much as 30 percent, according to the New York Times, presumably a combination of employees who won’t risk their health for a paycheck as well as those who have been impacted by the virus. Workers in at least three Amazon facilities in the US have staged walkouts, including Christian Smalls, an organizer at the company’s Staten Island, New York, facility. Amazon fired him the same day he led a walkout, saying he violated a 14-day quarantine that the company imposed after he had been in close contact with a colleague who tested positive for the coronavirus. (Smalls believes he was fired in retaliation for his activism.) And after notes leaked from an Amazon executive meeting showing the company’s top lawyer making derogatory remarks about Smalls and strategizing about targeting him in the media, it prompted tense debates among some Amazon corporate employees.

If this is the situation now, at a time when Amazon is in the spotlight and its executives are calling their front-line workers “heroes,” what does that mean for a post-pandemic world where Amazon might have even more hiring power, with fewer jobs to go around and scores of retail workers looking for work?

Amazon and Walmart are already the top two private-sector employers in the US, and Amazon boasts pay and benefit packages in its warehouses that are unmatched by most of its retail peers. For Amazon, any talk of labor also has to acknowledge the 200,000-plus robots already automating certain tasks in its facilities, and the possibility that the company might be inclined to invest even more in robotic labor because of the disruptions this crisis has caused among its human workforce.

Kaness says as more sales move online, the human touch provided by in-store labor won’t be as necessary.

“Amazon to me has always been a software company that sells things versus a retailer that’s great at data analytics,” he said. “Software companies are designed for greater efficiency [as they grow]. Retailers, not so much.”

Amazon’s fresh moment

The crisis has further strengthened retail giants’ current footholds while positioning them for new successes, and Amazon may have the most to gain.

While Amazon has struggled to get ahead in the grocery business, Walmart is already the largest seller of groceries in the US, with grocery sales that are 50 percent larger than the top traditional grocer, Kroger. Three years ago, Amazon’s grocery delivery services were still struggling enough that the company spent nearly $14 billion to acquire Whole Foods. Today, things are different. The company rolled its Amazon Fresh delivery service under its main Prime membership program in the fall, simultaneously eliminating the extra monthly fee and lowering the barrier to usage for customers. In the weeks after those changes, Amazon’s grocery delivery sales basically doubled year over year, according to estimates from the research firm Second Measure.

Now, during the pandemic, online grocery sales are soaring as many people try to avoid stores. This positions Amazon, which offers fresh grocery delivery from both Whole Foods stores and Amazon Fresh warehouses, to become the go-to online grocer for Prime members, with competition from Instacart, Walmart, and smaller regional players for non-Prime members. (One surveyshowed Walmart, which offers both curbside pickup and delivery, as the top choice for new online grocery shoppers in early March.)

“If you didn’t have the Amazon app before, you do now”

Another survey, from RBC Capital Markets, found that Amazon was the most popular online grocery destination for new shoppers over the past month, with 60 percent of respondents saying it was their first choice. Of those who use Amazon for grocery shopping, 34 percent said they are placing an order at least once a week, compared to 21 percent in the 2018 survey. Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods delivery sales rose more than 400 percent year over year the week of March 16, Second Measure estimates.

“If you’re Amazon right now, you couldn’t have caught a better break,” Kahan, of Birkenstock, said. “Grocery stores are also doing good, but the difference is when this is over, the grocery stores go back to just being grocery stores. But if you didn’t have the Amazon app before, you do now.”

With even more consumer adoption, competition concerns could follow. Take, for example, Amazon’s relationship with Birkenstock. Kahan, the CEO, has been a years-long critic of Amazon, dating back to a 2016 spat over counterfeits that resulted in Birkenstock ending its wholesale relationship with Amazon.

In late March, though, as coronavirus cases in the US were growing rapidly and store closures followed, Kahan reconsidered his options. Birkenstock still relies significantly on wholesale orders from brick-and-mortar chains like Journeys to reach certain sections of its customer base, but those retail chains are now closed. So Kahan did something that would have been completely off the table just 30 days earlier: He gave Zappos — the Amazon subsidiary with which Birkenstock has maintained a relationship — permission to start pushing some Birkenstock goods onto Amazon.com.

“Zappos is a long-time partner of Birkenstock and I have extensive relations with their organization and we share mutual respect,” Kahan wrote to Recode in a follow-up email. “[I]n times like this, smart people have to get creative with new approaches to the business.”

“It’s gonna become just Amazon, [brands selling] direct-to-consumer digitally, and then everyone else is just going to be everyone else in a bucket,” he added.

Kahan may be oversimplifying, but his point is clear: The pandemic has accelerated the shift to online shopping, and Amazon, which controlled nearly 40 percent of the online retail market in the US already, stands to gain the most.

For decades, Walmart was viewed as the big, bad bully of retail, known for cutthroat negotiations with brands resulting in bargain-basement prices that were great for consumers but terrible for Main Street shops unable to match them. In many ways, Amazon now carries the Walmart mantle. It, too, has been known to try to squeeze wholesale brands to their breaking point to provide customers low prices, while also being blamed for forcing mom-and-pop shops out of business. While Amazon provides a destination for hundreds of thousands of small and midsize sellers to make a living, it also competes intensely against those same merchants who supply vast amounts of merchandise for its virtual shelves.

Will Amazon’s essential role give it an antitrust pass?

That competition with its own sellers, and the fact that its algorithms and policies can make or break an Amazon seller’s business, have made Amazon a target over the past year for antitrust scrutiny from Congress and the Federal Trade Commission. But what Amazon’s role during this crisis — the good and bad — might mean for regulatory scrutiny is not yet clear. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on it.

The company has indeed done good during the crisis, in part simply by doing what it always does: making merchandise from the largest product catalog in the US available for online purchase and having it land at a customer’s door in a matter of days. It also recently limited the sale of N95 masks and other medical equipment exclusively to hospitals and government entities, eliminating the commission it would normally take from those sales to try to encourage more merchants to source those goods to sell on Amazon.

Yes, the company has struggled with delivery delays for general merchandise, price-gouging on the most in-demand products, and an overwhelmed grocery delivery business that has some customers searching for a delivery slot dozens of times a day. But it’s hard to imagine Amazon’s tens of millions of US customers being in a better spot during the pandemic if Amazon weren’t around. Might the good Amazon is doing lead lawmakers and regulators to give the company a pass?

As of now, there is no massive federal bailout coming to Big or Small Retail in the way there is for Big Airline. And that could be a big problem.

So far, the top lawmaker leading the House antitrust investigation into Amazon and the other Big Four tech giants said his probe will continue, though the release of a report due by the end of March is delayed. The FTC has also informally been probing Amazon, and there is no evidence that it has stopped.

Stacy Mitchell believes that’s the right decision. She’s the co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit that advocates for an economy built on strong independent businesses. She’s also a longtime critic of both Walmart and Amazon. In a 2016 report about Amazon’s growing power, Mitchell wrote:

Amazon presents a vastly more dangerous threat to competition than Walmart, because its ambition is not only to be the biggest player in the market. Its intention is to own the market itself by providing the underlying infrastructure — the online shopping platform, the shipping system, the cloud computing backbone — that competing firms depend on to transact business. In effect, Amazon is turning an open, public marketplace into a privately controlled one.

That infrastructure — specifically the shopping platform and the shipping system — has been strained during the crisis amid shopping surges and accompanying staffing issues. But it is still intact. And the company is making big decisions with far-reaching implications to keep it that way. One of the biggest was Amazon’s announcement in mid-March that it would stop accepting nonessential goods into its warehouses from vendors and Amazon sellers so it could prioritize items from six product categories it deemed essential. That decision may have been the right one, Mitchell said, but she argues that the fact that Amazon can even make a decision that big for society during a pandemic is a problem.

“That’s why I think we need to have robust public oversight over the decisions Amazon makes,” she said. “It can pick winners and losers, and now that has been vastly expanded because the offline market is essentially gone. And so Amazon’s domain is even more vast than it was before.”

Amazon has argued that it competes against both online and brick-and-mortar retailers and accounts for less than 4 percent of overall retail sales in the US, as well as less than 4 percent of the overall grocery market in the country. The company also maintains that its sellers are crucial partners since they account for nearly 60 percent of sales on Amazon shopping sites.

So if Amazon’s power is growing, where do traditional retailers go from here? It’s common knowledge in the retail industry that the US has more stores than it needs, so in some cases the crisis will only accelerate closures that would have happened anyway. For those who would have survived, the new CARES stimulus act does provide tax refunds to some retailers that have remodeled stores over the past two years. The Fed is working to give midsize and big companies access to more credit. Small businesses also have paths to get some financial help through the act, though the main lending program has been beset by early issues. As of now, there is no massive federal bailout coming to Big or Small Retail in the way there is for Big Airline. And that could be a big problem.

Speaking on CNBC recently, the president of the National Retail Federation said retailers “shouldn’t [have to] be worse off at the end of this than they were when they went into it.”

He was alluding to all the brick-and-mortar retailers that have been forced to shut down. On the other hand, there will be at least one big retailer that should exit the pandemic much better off: Amazon.

"['Constance Grady', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-09,Books to read when you are stuck with your family and they keep annoying you,"Welcome to the latest installment of Vox’s Ask a Book Critic, in which I, Vox book critic Constance Grady, provide book recommendations to suit your very specific mood: either how you’re feeling right now, or how you’d like to be feeling instead.

Personally, I am currently in the mood to read something quiet and restful by someone completely in control of their prose, so I just finished up with Robin McKinley’s Chalice. I grew up on McKinley, who came up in the ’70s as one of the first fantasy writers to let girls have adventures, and her exquisitely balanced sentences influenced my ear for prose more than probably any other writer.

Chalice came out in 2009, so it’s a late book for McKinley, and like many of her most recent works it’s quiet and reserved to the point of chilliness. It takes place in a fantasy realm that was ruled by a bad king for seven years, and now a new leadership team, inexperienced and denied the education that was their due, is trying to find a way to heal the shattered country. Also there’s a lot about honey. It’s exactly what I want to read.

It’s probably not exactly what you want to read, though, which is why this column exists. So let me help you find something that will take you where you want to go.

The recommendation requests below, submitted to me via email and on Twitter, have been edited for length and clarity.

I’m looking for a book about dysfunctional families. Quarantine has forced me to live with my own.

This question I have seen a fair amount of! I have two go-tos.

The Family Fang by Kevin Wilson is a warm and funny satire about two adults forced to move back in with their performance artist parents. It will make you think, “Hey, at least my parents never forced me to narc on them to the mall security guard while they stole jelly beans from a candy store as a commentary on capitalism on my sixth birthday.” (Unless that did happen to you, in which case I am very sorry.)

I’m also a big advocate, in general, for well-written children’s literature in times of stress, and children’s literature is very good in particular on the subject of being trapped in your terrible gross house with your terrible gross family who will not stop annoying you, ugh.

Lately I’ve been thinking about Nancy Bond’s A String in the Harp, about an American family doing a semester abroad in a little town in Wales. The house is tiny and weird and the family can’t figure out how to heat it or cook good food in it, and they’re all mad at each other and grieving a recent death, so they’re prickly and constantly getting on each other’s nerves. But over time they adapt, adjust, and work together to build a deeply cozy home for themselves. (There is also magic, but oddly that is maybe the weakest part of this book? I always skip it in rereads and focus on the sections where the teenage daughter learns to bake bread and the family goes out for fish and chips.)

Looking for nonfiction. I want to feel smarter, but not have to concentrate too hard. Something that will teach me about a world I’m not familiar with.

Try Susan Orlean’s The Library Book, about the LA Public Library fire of 1986. It’s so tense and gripping that it reads like a novel, and it explores the past and future of America’s libraries in really smart and thoughtful ways.

Just ended an 11-year relationship right before sheltering in place. Feeling sick of romance and love, and seeking a bit of non-romantic faith that things will be okay.

Now might be a good time for Nancy Mitford! She wrote very clear-eyed and unromantic but hopeful fiction during some very dark times. Pigeon Pie might be the book of hers to begin with. It was written during the ramp-up to World War II, and it’s about a British aristocrat who gets bored volunteering at the Red Cross and decides to become a beautiful female spy.

I want to escape my living room by reading a book that transports me to a new place and takes me on an adventure through jungles or deserts or frozen tundra.

If you want something intense and a little challenging, the move would be Black Leopard Red Wolf by Marlon James. It’s literary fantasy set in a world inspired by African folklore, and the landscape is incredibly rich and immersive and will absolutely take you away. This book is deliberately designed to resist easy reading, though, and the reception has been polarizing. (I found it a little bit of a slog, although I know others adored it. And even skeptics like me can’t deny the setting is amazing!) So I’ll also throw out as an option East of the Sun by Julia Gregson. It’s about three young British women traveling to India in 1928, and it’s extremely charming and fun.

I’m constantly finding myself procrastinating. Could you recommend a self-help book about time management?

So for general organizing stuff, I like Julie Morgenstern, who wrote Time Management from the Inside Out: She’s good at creating strategies to help you adapt the way you think about an issue rather than imposing rules on you from above.

But I also think that during a global catastrophe like the one we are in right now, it is very normal and reasonable to find yourself having trouble doing work! As Neil Webb put it in a widely shared tweet, we are not working from home right now. We are in our homes during a crisis and trying to do work.

If you find it difficult to be productive right now, don’t beat yourself up about it. It’s enough just to get through the day. Jenny Odell explores some ideas related to this issue very beautifully in her book How To Do Nothing.

If you’d like me to recommend something to you, email me at constance.grady@vox.com with the subject line “Ask a Book Critic.” The more specific your mood, the better!

"['Daniel Markus', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-09,Your food delivery app comes at a cost to restaurants,"In March, just a few days before a looming stay-at-home order would take effect in Chicago, restaurateur Nick Kokonas faced a terrifying prospect: empty dining rooms at his restaurants.

“There will be no reservations in the United States of America. What do we do?”

For Kokonas, the answer was to almost totally reinvent both of his businesses. In addition to his five restaurants employing almost 300 people, which include the highly experimental Alinea — where a meal can easily cost upwards of $250 a person — he also runs Tock, a reservation app for fine dining restaurants.

Both quickly pivoted to takeout and delivery. Alinea began offering beef Wellington and coq au vin for takeout at only $35 per plate, and Kokonas’ employees at Tock worked around the clock to retool the reservation app into a new pickup and delivery ordering system called Tock To Go.

According to Kokonas, the pivot has worked. Alinea has been able to rehire more than half of its 84 staff members, and the restaurant is earning about 75 percent of its normal revenue. Tock To Go has seen a surge of new restaurants joining the platform.

“We have over 850 [restaurants] that are in the process of coming on board, really as fast as they can get their kitchens going again. And we have great success stories. It’s not just the high-end places like n/naka, you know, selling bento boxes in Los Angeles. … There’s a small restaurant … that emailed us and said ‘when we were busy before the pandemic, we would do $3,000 to $4,000 a day in sales. And I just hired three more cooks because we’re doing $20,000 a day in sales.’”

But Tock’s new platform is puny compared to the dominant apps in the food-delivery world. Seamless alone has 12,000 restaurants, 40 times more than Tock To Go. And these apps that facilitate delivery during the pandemic, like UberEats, DoorDash, and GrubHub, are the same ones bleeding restaurants dry.

On this episode of Reset, we look at how restaurants are turning to delivery platforms to survive the pandemic.

If you want to support your favorite restaurants during the pandemic, here’s what Eater’s Caleb Pershan suggests: “If you want to go get takeout yourself and feel healthy and comfortable enough to do it, it’d be best if you call the restaurant directly so that that large cut isn’t taken by a third-party delivery app. Maybe they’ll be able to deliver food themselves. Go straight to the restaurant in any way you can, either by calling them or by going to their website. If you do use a third-party app to get a delivery, tip handsomely.”

"['Sean Illing', 'Apr']",2019-10-17,Capitalism is turning us into addicts,"Capitalism is great at making people want things they don’t need.

And of course this is what we should expect from a system that runs on production and consumption. Companies make and sell products and those products have to be consumed by as many people as possible — that’s what makes the whole thing work.

So it’s not surprising that businesses do everything they can to convince people to buy whatever they’re selling. But what happens when marketing becomes active manipulation? More precisely, what happens when companies use science and technology not only to refine our pleasures but to engineer addictive behaviors?

A 2019 book by University of North Florida historian and addiction expert David T. Courtwright, called The Age of Addiction: How Bad Habits Became Big Business, tries to answer these questions in a fascinating history of corporate America’s efforts to shape our habits and desires.

What we have is something Courtwright calls “limbic capitalism,” a reference to the part of the brain that deals with pleasure and motivation. As our understanding of psychology and neurochemistry has advanced, companies have gotten better at exploiting our instincts for profit. Think, for example, of all the apps and platforms specifically designed to hijack our attention with pings and dopamine hits while harvesting our data.

We’ve always had some form of limbic capitalism, Courtwright says, but the methods are much more sophisticated now and the range of addictive behaviors are much wider than they used to be. I spoke to Courtwright about the problems this has created, why the battle against limbic capitalism is seemingly endless, and if he thinks we’re destined to live in a consumerist dystopia.

A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.

Sean Illing

“Limbic capitalism” is a strange phrase at the center of your book. What does it mean and why should people be aware of it?

David T. Courtwright

Well, limbic capitalism is just my shorthand for global industries that basically encourage excessive consumption and even addiction. In fact, you could make that even stronger and say not only do they encourage it but now they’ve reached the point where they’re actually designing it.

Sean Illing

And where does that word “limbic” come from?

David T. Courtwright

It’s a reference to the limbic region of your brain, which is the part of your brain that deals with pleasure, motivation, long-term memory, and other functions that are crucial for survival. You couldn’t live without your limbic system and you couldn’t reproduce without it, and that’s why it has evolved. And yet that same system is now susceptible to hijacking by corporate interests in a way that actually works against your long-term survival prospects. That’s the paradox.

Sean Illing

How is it hijacked?

David T. Courtwright

The short answer is that companies offer products that will produce a burst release of dopamine in a way that conditions and ultimately changes the brain and develops certain addictive behaviors, which is to say behaviors that are harmful. Now, people have always peddled products that are potentially addictive. But what’s happened in the last 100 years or so is that more of these commercial strategies come from highly organized corporations that do very sophisticated research and find more ways to market these addictive goods and services.

Sean Illing

It seems to me that capitalism runs on the addictions of consumers, has always run on the addictions of consumers, and therefore this isn’t all that revelatory.

David T. Courtwright

I hear this sort of point all the time, and my answer is that it’s not quite right. I make a distinction between ordinary capitalist enterprises like companies that sell people rakes or plows or nails or whatever — there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, and, in fact, the free market is very good at distributing those goods. It’s a force for human progress.

But I think of limbic capitalism as capitalism’s evil twin, a really cancerous outgrowth of productive capitalism. There is a certain class of brain-rewarding products that lead to a form of pathological learning that we call addiction, and it’s that branch of capitalism that is especially dangerous.

So I’m not anti-capitalism, but I am calling attention to a certain species of capitalism that cultivates addictive behavior for profit.

Sean Illing

What sort of industries or products are we talking about? Who traffics in limbic capitalism?

David T. Courtwright

If you’d asked that question half a century ago I would’ve said we’re mainly talking about alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. But in the last 20 or 25 years, there’s been a big expansion of the concept of addiction. So now we don’t just speak about addiction to drugs, we speak about addiction to pornography, to computer games, to social media, to food, to all kinds of things.

What happens in the last few decades is an explosion of technological innovation and mass production and mass marketing and, most recently, the rise of the internet, which has really accelerated the process and opened up new spaces for limbic capitalists to both grab our attention and sell us more products.

Limbic capitalism in the age of digital technology is truly a whole new ballgame.

Sean Illing

The point about digital technology seems especially important. Everyone who has a smartphone in their pocket, everyone who uses social media, everyone participating in the digital game is, one way or another, a prisoner of limbic capitalism. Every time we hear that ping from a like or a retweet, we get that dopamine hit. If that’s not an addiction, I don’t know what is.

David T. Courtwright

That actually gets at a very interesting question: Is it the internet and [related] devices that are addictive, or is it the content of the internet that’s addictive? I think it’s both.

You have traditional commercial vices like pornography, or alcohol, or drugs that are available through the internet, but you also have internet-linked mobile devices that themselves come to function almost like gambling machines, where you’re constantly getting dinged. You’re constantly getting messages, you’re concerned about likes, you’re wondering about the latest post, you have this fear of missing out.

And this is key: You’re not just responding to these devices, you’re anticipating them. That’s another thing about addictive behaviors: they don’t simply provide reward, they also provide conditioning. Smartphone technologies arguably accomplish this better than any device or product in human history.

Sean Illing

The controversy around vaping and Juul seems like a good example of how limbic capitalism works in practice.

David T. Courtwright

It’s a perfect example because it captures several features of a limbic capitalist enterprise, both historically and in terms of its current manifestation. So number one, limbic capitalists target the young. This is probably the most politically sensitive aspect of limbic capitalism. The idea of vaping, the idea of a harm-reduction smoking replacement device for confirmed devices is great — who could object to that?

But as the product has developed, especially since Juul came along, there’s been more and more of an emphasis on the youth market. Which is what we’ve always seen from Big Tobacco and Big Alcohol: the youth are your best customers because they’ll be around the longest.

It’s about more than just delivering the product, though. One of the discoveries I made is that when you look at the history of potentially addictive pleasures, there’s a tendency to blend vices and experiences in ways that increase the addictive qualities of products. Las Vegas is a great example of this. Vegas is not just about gambling; it’s a place where you can booze it up, it’s about nightclubs and big spectacles and all the dazzling amusements — everything is wrapped up in a big hedonic package.

Sean Illing

I’d love to know how you distinguish the manufacture of new demands with the satisfaction of demands that already exist.

David T. Courtwright

That’s a very interesting question. Eating is not a manufactured demand. You have to eat to survive, but you don’t have to eat highly processed food that stimulates the release of dopamine in a way that alters your mood and gives you a rush.

What we’ve done is we’ve taken things like sugar or salt that were once comparatively scarce and valuable commodities and made these things massively available. So once you get the ingredients that are capable of producing brain reward, then it’s just a matter of designing products that will essentially maximize that brain reward.

So again, the demand, “I’ve got to eat something,” was always there, but what the processed food industry does, because it’s so competitive, is create products that will provide the calories and nutrients in ways that act like mood-altering drugs. And that’s where the line between simple marketing and limbic capitalism lies.

Sean Illing

Sure, everyone needs to eat, but not everyone needs to tweet or buy 13 pairs of sunglasses or own a closet of products that add nothing to their life apart from marking their identity and status for other people. These are the sorts of manufactured demands I had in mind, and they’re harder to pin down than our appetite for things like booze or junk food.

David T. Courtwright

Ten years ago I would’ve agreed with you. I would’ve said nobody really needs to tweet, nobody needs a Facebook page. But there are what I call opt-in and opt-out technologies.

Once upon a time, the internet and internet access were opt-in technologies. In other words, you adopted these things, you learned how to use them. But now I think we’ve reached the point where they’ve become opt-out technologies, where you’re going to have to do something radical or unusual like go off the grid or throw away your smartphone to escape it.

Once you’re in an environment where you’ve got to have this device, you’re in an environment where you will be constantly exposed to what the policy analyst Jonathan Caulkins calls “temptation goods.” You may have a firm resolution to use your smartphone just for email, or just to check the New York Times, or for a handful of other more or less straightforward functions, but sooner or later the convenience of these other devices and other apps will creep up on you and then you’ll become enmeshed in all of it.

Another way to say this is that as consumers we swim in a sea with sharp hooks everywhere. Fifty years ago, the main hooks were drugs like alcohol and tobacco. Those were the primary addictive threats. And now there’s been this tremendous multiplication of hooks in our consumerist sea.

Sean Illing

You end the book on an optimistic note, but I have to say, the problem seems insoluble to me. American capitalism is extremely good at undercutting threats. I feel like the most likely scenario is a consumerist dystopia propped up by a whole range of new and widespread addictions.

Feel free to talk me off the ledge.

David T. Courtwright

Well, one of the strikes against limbic capitalism is that when it goes after children, which it has to do to find replacement users, that eventually becomes an issue and it leads to serious pushback. There are really good examples of campaigns against limbic capitalist products like cigarettes that, if not quite successful, at least fought the industry to a standstill.

I’d also say that ridicule is an effective weapon. I mean, think about what happened to the tobacco industry both in the United States and in Australia when the lies of the industry were exposed by some very aggressive activists who used ridicule and satire as effective tools.

And we have tax policy, we have potential structural limitations, we have lawsuits and big class action cases that pose serious problems for American limbic capitalists. We’re already seeing these sorts of actions against the opioid industry, for example, and that’s encouraging.

So it’s not quite true that we don’t have tools to fight back, but you’re right — it’s an uphill battle.

"['Fabrizio Hochschild', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Apr']",2020-04-10,Coronavirus news: Top UN official calls for cyberattacks worldwide to stop immediately,"With the world focused on combating the Covid-19 pandemic, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate global ceasefire of armed conflict. The virus, he said, “does not care about nationality or ethnicity, faction or faith. It attacks all, relentlessly.”

The call has been endorsed by an ever-growing number of countries and some 70 regional partners, civil society organizations, and all UN Messengers of Peace and Advocates for the Sustainable Development Goals. We have also seen more than 2 million people worldwide take citizen action in support of the Covid-19 ceasefire appeal.

This is encouraging impact. But to be truly successful in our efforts to curb Covid-19, we must also strive to uphold this ceasefire in the digital world as well.

Consider that in the month of March alone, hospitals, medical facilities, government health agencies, and testing centers, and even the World Health Organization (WHO) have faced targeted cyberattacks perpetrated by criminals and other malicious actors. The purpose of these crimes, it can be assumed, is to undermine our Covid-19 response capabilities.

In the case of the WHO, a place that much of the world depends upon for accurate and timely public health information and support to national responses, the threat was reported as unsuccessful. Yet the WHO chief information security officer sounded a warning: The pace and number of these threats have increased considerably.

Let’s be clear: Attacks in the digital domain are in many ways tantamount to physical ones.

Digital technology now underpins core societal functions and infrastructure, including supporting access to food, water, housing, energy, health care, and transportation. When launched successfully, digital attacks are catastrophic and can lead to loss of life.

The UN secretary-general’s call for a global ceasefire is about protecting the most vulnerable among us. If authorities in the most developed and peaceful countries are struggling to manage, how can health systems and frontline organizations operating in war-torn countries possibly be prepared to cope with a potential attack to their digital infrastructure during a pandemic?

And how can we ask our health care workers, diagnostic and treatment facilities, researchers, and hospitals — those bound by the selflessness of duty and banded together against a common, hidden enemy — to continue containing the crisis while questioning whether vital equipment may be affected or shut down by a digital attack?

Covid-19 has massively accelerated the digitalization of society, at least in those countries that enjoy high rates of internet connectivity. We are also witnessing firsthand how digital technology has been essential in keeping economies and societies functioning through facilitating remote work and learning, and in keeping us virtually connected in a time of physical and social distance.

We rely on digital cooperation more than ever before, and as such, we are at a critical inflection point as a global society. Maintaining and ensuring trust and security in the digital world during this global health crisis is imperative. The responsible use of technology must be protected through better international cooperation.

We must commit to an immediate digital ceasefire, and governments, civil society groups, and the private sector must set the tone. Without this step, our global response to the pandemic will be weakened.

We are living in uncertain and unprecedented times. The UN secretary-general has called on the world to respect a global ceasefire so that we can come together, in solidarity to face this human crisis. To save lives, that obligation should extend to the digital domain.

"['Rebecca Heilweil', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-25,Meet the renegade engineers on Slack trying to fix the coronavirus supplies shortage,"When Charles He, a management and machine learning freelancer based in Victoria, British Columbia, realized the Covid-19 coronavirus was coming to the United States, he stocked up to prepare for months of social distancing. And then he started a Slack.

The idea was to connect people who wanted to work on efficient devices that could help fight the pandemic. We would need ventilators, he figured, but also personal protective equipment and lots of it. He, an economist by training, says he’d never done anything like that before but set off to scour sites like Reddit and Hacker News for engineers who might be interested in helping.

Fittingly, He called his nascent digital community, launched on March 9, Helpful Engineering. The group is dispersed and somewhat intentionally unorganized, and it’ll be a while before it’s clear how many of the ideas floated by its members actually make it into the hands of frontline workers. But only two weeks in, a face shield design project organized with the Slack’s support has already delivered much-needed protective equipment to some hospitals. And, the group can already say it’s brought people across the globe a little closer together — and kept them busy.

Uniting idealists can happen faster than you think.

The Helpful Engineering group now boasts thousands of volunteers working on dozens of projects with the ultimate aim of solving some of the tough problems that Covid-19 and our response to the pandemic pose. And other DIY projects have already had some impact: People are sewing homemade (though not the N-95) masks and mixing their own hand sanitizer.

“We aren’t trying to build some fancy shiny thing that looks good to us, that’s enjoyable. We focus on things that have the most value,” He told Recode. “And what has the most value? Often simple — unexciting in the media — [things] that actually save lives.”

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

That’s the same mentality, He explains, behind his work in effective altruism, an aggressively utilitarian philosophical and social movement bolstered by the philosopher Peter Singer. The idea, generally, is to be rigidly efficient, investing resources and effort to maximize the amount of good we can achieve. How efficient? Well, He once created an algorithm for determining “the exact location and number of animals in each Iowa egg farm based on Google Earth data” as part of an animal welfare effort.

As for the Helpful Engineering group, the effective altruism mindset has manifested in He’s intent to focus on building tools that are the easiest to create and will do the most amount of good. What the Slack is not is a social platform for hobbyists, flashy biohacking, or reinventing the wheel. Rather, it’s a giant community for engineers — and many others bored at home with nothing else to do — to take a stab at designing something that just might make the impact of this pandemic a little less awful.

Of course, He wasn’t the only one with the idea to collaborate on building simple tools and supplies through crowdsourcing. While combing through the internet, He soon stumbled upon two Brits: a software engineer named Alexander James Phillips, and Chris Graham, a doctoral student at the University of Warwick who was active on JOGL (short for Just One Giant Lab), an open web platform for collaborative engineering projects.

Related The most ridiculous ways companies are trying to profit from the coronavirus outbreak

They all joined forces, combining their Slacks. Soon, others trickled in to help: programmers, engineers, owners of 3D printers, someone who works on spacecraft, a neuroscientist, a nurse. Even David Galbraith, who helped create Yelp, jumped in the chat.

Reddit helped bring initial traffic to the group. And some popped in from another widely popular crowdsourcing Facebook group, called Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies. (That group, which now has more than 30,000 members, claims to have identified potential solutions — though some are last resorts and far from health authority-approved medical devices — for about 70 percent of the supplies needed to treat Covid-19, according to Live Science).

Then João Nascimento, a scientist studying at Harvard who is running an affiliated project, appeared on Portuguese national television to talk about his work and the publicity brought even more new users to Helpful Engineering.

“It became a second wave of viralness,” explains Graham. Meanwhile, the pandemic’s impact in Europe had worsened. Graham’s lab shut down, leaving him to work on Helpful Engineering full time.

Now it’s been 16 days since the Slack launched, and the group’s at more than 13,000 users with more than 3,000 officially registered volunteers. People come from the US but also countries like India, Poland, Portugal, and Brazil. There are about 35 different projects underway, including some to manufacture protective face shields and design make-do ventilators. Meanwhile, new contributors — students, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and even a small-town mayor from Texas — continue to join the cause.

Forming a Slack group of 13,000 is hard, but managing one is much harder

When you first log in to the Helpful Engineering Slack group, it seems like enthusiastic chaos. People come to the introductions channel to share sliced-up versions of their LinkedIn bios, retrofitted to the demands of a pandemic. Some share designs for homemade ventilators, often machines they’ve dreamt up themselves. There are many, many links shared. There are groups for 3D printing, an idea for an ultraviolet disinfection system, legal advice, and even an idea for an open source guide that could bring us closer to more Covid-19 home testing kits.

That lack of organization represents an underlying core philosophy. He, the co-founder, doesn’t believe that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have the capability of “organizing and coordinating a huge amount of engineering talent to create useful things.” His Slack group might do that, but he acknowledges there’s a trade-off. He talks about “two masters.” One is the pressure to get things done as quickly as possible, and the other is the desire to create “a very effective system for organizing human activity together.”

He calls it a “swarm model.” By maintaining limited hierarchy, the project aims to collect an immense amount of talent and surface the best ideas. With a few good engineering minds, He hopes technical problems can be broken down, solutions can be weighed, and effort can be effectively dispersed so that the collective can hack together anything that might help.

“You get as many people who are motivated and have the experience necessary, and you put them into one channel and just see what happens,” says Brian Finch, a patent attorney who is now the chief operating officer of a Michigan-based company called Brightz that produces decorative lights for bicycles. “Some of it is going to be chaos, by its nature.”

But as the group has grown, a sort of governance structure has emerged. There are 15 people He considers founders (users who have been on the Slack for at least 16 days). Then there are 60 moderators, another 60-plus project managers, and about 35 project leaders. Now, a first wave of projects have been vetted, analyzed by voting on their quality and best guesses as to how quickly they could be produced, along with screenings from “experts” in the group.

The Slack group has no formal funding, and it doesn’t have any official legal status. And while some of the projects are well on their way to developing prototypes, there’s still a sense of disarray as the group tries to figure out how to quickly funnel newcomers in the group into productive roles. Slack might be a platform popular at workspaces, but the group is far from a streamlined company. It remains to be seen whether Helpful Engineering, with a still-emerging structure of leadership, will assemble together its thousands of members into a meaningful and productive community.

The simplest designs and concepts have the most promise.

There are lots of different ideas floating around the Slack. But one of the furthest-along projects is a face shield that can be produced quickly and easily. It’s exactly what you’re thinking: a screen attached to a headband.

“The face shield is the first line of defense for droplet protection, if someone comes into a clinic or if somebody is working in a factory — or something like that — and someone else coughs,” explains Nick Moser, a Bay Area-based project manager at a custom fabrication shop. Moser normally works on large art installations, but since his workplace shut down, he’s been leading Mask Project, a subset of the Helpful Engineering initiative.

Moser cautions that the face shield design is by no means the same as the much-coveted N-95 mask, and these face shields aren’t technically medical devices. Still, thousands are now being produced around the world through “crowdsourced manufacturing,” which essentially involves companies — either those that reach out or are reached out to — that can offer to take up producing these protective screens philanthropically.

Moser admits that he’s not actually sure who is currently making them but says that the shields are now being used by Valley Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente in California. And Moser’s Mask Project is hardly the only one producing such protective face screens. The auto giant Ford announced on Tuesday that it would start producing plastic shields of its own.

Another idea, also being facilitated through Helpful Engineering, is an “offset ventilator.” The idea is to develop a way to turn a ventilation airbag — these are sometimes called “Ambu” bags and are normally manually operated by an EMT — into an autonomous ventilator, with the help of basic machinery. Right now, Finch is working on building something that’s demonstrable, though he admits that doctors may be hesitant to rely on such a device.

“How do you manually compress this air bladder in a way that it can turn into a ventilator? That’s what a lot of people are trying to solve right now,” Finch says, pointing out that people across the internet have posted about their own approaches to the same idea, including a University of Minnesota doctor.

And that’s not the only way people are hoping to address the ventilator shortage. Another idea is to adapt continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines, which are usually used by people who struggle to breathe properly while sleeping. Two engineers from a small startup in Italy used 3D printing to make much-needed valves for high-grade medical ventilators, and one Canadian doctor has proposed running two hoses from the same ventilator — which could help two patients breathe at the same time.

Face shields are one thing, but tools that theoretically replace medical devices need the confidence of doctors and other health professionals. And what about liability, if one of these gadgets produced by Helpful Engineering doesn’t work as intended? Chris Graham says that, ultimately, health care workers will have to decide on their own whether they can make use of these devices while Phillips emphasizes that we’re in a moment of crisis where waiting around for an absolutely perfect solution could ultimately risk lives.

“Even if we don’t succeed at this particular project with this particular design,” Finch says, “I’m optimistic that with so many people working on this problem, somebody is going to find a solution.”

At the very least, Finch argues, trying to be a “helpful engineer” is a way to pass the time. “I could either sit at home, nervously refreshing Reddit and feeling bad about the state of the world, or I can at least still feel bad about the state of the world but at least know that I’m giving it my best.”

So maybe not every thought shared in a 13,000-member Slack group will ultimately end up in the hands of a health care worker. But that might be all right anyway.

Part of Issue #6 of The Highlight, our home for ambitious stories that explain our world.

When Jane McGonigal started feeling anxious as hell 10 years ago, she unwittingly joined a club with 40 million members. That’s how many American adults are affected by anxiety — the most common mental illness in the country — every single year.

McGonigal’s problems started when she suffered a concussion in the summer of 2009. The side effects, she says, were brutal. She spent months in bed with non-stop headaches, nausea, vertigo, memory loss, and, ultimately, serious anxiety and depression. She began to think the pain would never end. She was suicidal.

But McGonigal had something that set her apart from other anxiety sufferers: She is a game designer. She spent a decade researching the psychology of games, even writing a dissertation on it, so she knew that games can help us face tough challenges with more creativity and optimism. And her anxiety was definitely a tough challenge.

I am either going to kill myself, she thought, or I am going to turn this into a game.

She chose the latter. Being a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, she created a mental game for herself called “Jane the Concussion Slayer.” The object was to recover faster by avoiding “bad guys” that triggered her symptoms (like bright lights) and engaging in “power-ups” that made her feel good (like a walk around the block). She recruited allies — her sister, her husband — to play along. And even though her physical pain persisted for months, she says she suffered less emotional pain within days.

Ever wonder how your mind works? Watch The Mind, Explained, our 5-part miniseries on the workings of the brain. Available to stream now on Netflix.

Eager to share her game with others, she rebranded it SuperBetter and developed a smartphone app, which she launched in 2012. A million users have since played it to work through symptoms of anxiety and other issues.

Americans — a whopping one-third of whom will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives — have proven there’s a huge market for products that promise to relieve their distress. Anxiety consumerism is now big business. As some people become disenchanted with pharmaceuticals and their side effects, they’re buying fidget spinners, weighted blankets, and apps. In fact, market researchers are forecasting that growing numbers of people will increasingly turn to apps instead of pills to alleviate their mental health problems.

I downloaded SuperBetter on my phone to see how it would work. The first thing that struck me was its bright rainbow color scheme, which felt cheerful, even cutesy. The app opens with a prompt to identify the main challenge you want to work on, such as anxiety, and then presents a curated series of “quests” and “power-ups,” such as deep breathing or exercising. It rewards players with points when they’re achieved.

Players, meanwhile, vanquish “bad guys” (like black-and-white thinking or catastrophizing), enlist allies (real-life friends), and go for an “epic win.” It feels just like a video game — so much so that I almost didn’t notice the smorgasbord of exercises was mined from clinically proven treatment approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy.

At first, I rolled my eyes at the exercises, thinking they were too simple to do much good. Plus, I found the app’s cheerfulness almost oppressive: “Keep going — you can finish it!” it encouraged me at every turn. But despite myself, I began to find the app really fun. I kept coming back to it whenever I wanted to de-stress or kick an unhealthy habit. It got me to take long walks and second-guess myself less.

SuperBetter may be the app that most explicitly turns battling anxiety into a game, but it’s by no means the only one. The past few years have seen an explosion in such apps — there’s Headspace, Happify, Calm, Mind Ease, MindShift, Personal Zen, and Stop, Breathe & Think, to name a few.

The apps vary widely; some resemble games a lot more than others do. But to one degree or another, they all use what’s known as gamification — the application of classic gaming elements, like scoring points, to a non-game context, like mental health. Uniting the apps is a relentless spirit of playful positivity.

They’re colorful and cheerful! They award “badges” and “stickers”! They urge you to use emojis to record your feelings! They congratulate you for achieving a streak of consecutive days spent meditating! They give you panda gifs and fireworks displays!

It’s not surprising that gamified anxiety apps are flooding the market. Gamification is increasingly used as a tool for behavior modification in many fields, from dating (ever been Super Liked?) to language-learning.

But it’s fair to ask whether making anxiety apps into fun games might fuel our societal addiction to tech, which could, in turn, make our anxiety even worse. In fact, you might wonder whether the tech world is trying to sell us on a solution to a problem that is partly of its own making. Silicon Valley’s attention economy has long used psychological inducements to get us hooked on devices, upping our user engagement in order to maximize their profit.

Which makes it more urgent to ask: Do these apps actually work to relieve anxiety?

The science behind gamification and its effects on anxiety

Anxiety is a broad term for a range of disorders, from generalized anxiety disorder to social anxiety to specific phobias. Its symptoms can be both physical (chest pain, palpitations) and mental (inability to stop worrying, fear of losing control). Sometimes, it manifests as insomnia. As a general rule, it really sucks.

And it seems to be getting worse. Young people in particular report ever higher levels of anxiety in annual surveys. Experts debate whether we’re actually more anxious than our parents or grandparents were, or whether we’re just reporting and being diagnosed with anxiety at higher rates. Either way, there’s definitely a widespread perception that we’re becoming increasingly anxious. Just Google “millennials and anxiety” and you’ll find countless articles calling millennials “the most anxious generation in history.”

What’s causing all this chronic worry? People have blamed smartphones, climate change, the economy, President Trump, or any other number of things. The truth is, we don’t have enough evidence to lay the blame confidently at any one doorstep. The sources of anxiety are multiple and different for different people.

Here’s something we do know: Anxiety sufferers face a lot of barriers when trying to access conventional mental health treatment. Therapy is expensive and time-consuming. Medication often comes with stigma and side effects, and gaining access to it requires going through medical gatekeepers. Gamified apps, by contrast, make treatment seem engaging, portable, destigmatized, prescriptionless, and cheap, if not totally free.

Yet very few have been scientifically tested.

“In the past decade there’s been a big movement toward gamification [in mental health apps], but there’s a lack of empirical evidence around these techniques,” says Tracy Dennis-Tiwary, a psychology professor at Hunter College who studies gamified apps. Just because a CBT exercise works in a clinical setting, she said, you can’t assume it’ll work when delivered through a gamified app. “If we’re going to make this digital therapeutics field work, we need more of an evidence base, because right now it’s the Wild West.”

Research suggests that gamification generally boosts motivation and user engagement. That’s why Uber uses it to induce drivers to work longer hours in specific locations, Tinder uses it to get us to keep swiping even after we’ve found a good date, and Duolingo uses it to make sure we don’t miss a single day of language-learning. Mental health apps use gamification for the same reasons: motivation and engagement. For those suffering from anxiety or its often co-occurring cousin, depression, it can be hard to find motivation to keep working on their issues. And if they don’t enjoy an app, they’re likely to engage less and less with the evidence-based treatments baked into it. It’s those treatments that make the app effective.

In a way, gamifying mental health treatment is like coating broccoli with candy to get us to eat it.

Playing SuperBetter certainly feels like eating candy. A 2016 systematic review of previous studies noted that “SuperBetter allows ‘snacktivity,’ frequent, brief activities that can be done a few minutes at a time, every day or more often (therefore like “snacking” behavior).” It added that the app has been validated in randomized controlled trials: “Participants who were asked to play SuperBetter for 10 minutes daily over 30 days experienced significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and anxiety compared to a waitlist control group.”

The SuperBetter website points to the findings of the trial, conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and published in 2015. It also lists a clinical trial at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center that suggested that apps structured like games, with the user positioned as a hero trying to achieve a win, help teens with unresolved concussion symptoms. McGonigal, the inventor of SuperBetter, is a co-author on that 2017 study.

The website also boasts impressive results in two meta-analysis studies, which showed that SuperBetter had the greatest effect for reducing anxiety and depression symptoms, compared to a host of other smartphone apps also evaluated in randomized controlled trials.

Even on SuperBetter itself, McGonigal likes to lead with the science. The app shows you Science Cards, mini-articles that explain exactly why its exercises — from mindfulness meditation to gratitude journaling — are effective at changing your brain to reduce anxiety. Many of them link out to articles and books written by scientists, including the app inventor’s twin sister, Stanford psychologist Kelly McGonigal. Kelly was the first person Jane McGonigal called when she decided to create her recovery game in 2009, and she later incorporated the research of many other experts.

Dennis-Tiwary, the Hunter College psychologist, has developed her own anxiety-reducing app, Personal Zen. It’s unlike most other apps in the space in that it makes a game of just one cognitive treatment: attention-bias modification training (ABMT). The basic idea is that if you’re anxious, you tend to latch onto negative information in the world and filter out the positive, a habit that further feeds anxiety. ABMT helps by retraining your attention to disengage from the negative and favor the positive.

In the Personal Zen game, an angry face (negative) and a happy face (positive) zoom around a desolate grey landscape. You have to trace the path of sparkles left by the happy face, while ignoring the angry face. Do that quickly and the app will reward you with a colorful gem or medallion. The more you do it, the more the landscape fills up with lush color.

It sounds simple, yet the app’s effectiveness in treating stress and anxiety was demonstrated in a handful of clinical trials. One 2017 study, co-authored by Dennis-Tiwary and published in Biological Psychology, targeted pregnant women. It showed that playing the game reduced the level of cortisol, the primary stress hormone, in their bodies after a month of use.

In addition to attention training, another useful technique for reducing anxiety is cognitive absorption — just taking your mind off whatever you’re ruminating about. And you know what’s really good for that? Video games. They don’t necessarily need to be games specifically designed to reduce anxiety. Research shows that even good old Tetris or Fortnite can do the trick. A study of 112 kids undergoing surgery, for example, demonstrated that playing a handheld video game before the operation was effective at reducing anxiety — even more effective than anti-anxiety medication.

Potential pitfalls with gamified anxiety apps

One night around 11 pm, I was tinkering with Stop, Breathe & Think, an app that drives users towards stress-taming exercises in much the same way SuperBetter does. I had just completed the mini-meditation it recommended, so it rewarded me with the “Night Owl” sticker. I was about to do another exercise when my friend texted, asking if I wanted to have a phone call. I ignored her. There were 43 other stickers waiting to be collected on this app, and I kind of wanted them.

A moment later, I realized how foolish that was. Surely, talking to my friend (or, for that matter, going to sleep at 11 pm) would be better for my well-being than racking up another virtual reward.

Gamification keeps us coming back, but to a point that can actually start to feel addictive, cutting into our time with restorative forces such as friendship or sleep. Many gamified anxiety apps incorporate research by trained psychologists. But they’re often collaborations between psychologists, game designers, and entrepreneurs.

“The key is, don’t put too much candy on the broccoli, otherwise you defeat the purpose,” said Spencer Greenberg, founder of the Mind Ease app, which purports to offer quick anxiety relief. “I think there’s a temptation for startups to just try to get user engagement, because they can go to investors with it. But that’s not a long-term solution. If you’re not actually providing value, engagement doesn’t buy you much.”

McGonigal said she designed SuperBetter in a way that indicates people should use it for about 10 minutes a day, not 10 hours. “We have a recommended dose of engagement: You do three power-ups, do one quest, and battle one bad guy a day. We’ve specifically designed the app so that we cut you off — you can’t earn more points or keep leveling up after that,” she said, adding that she recommends a 30-day intervention to acquire skills like attention training. “We don’t think this type of app is meant to be used forever.”

Dennis-Tiwary has a similar mindset. If you want to increase anxiety, she told me, the best thing you can do is avoid your feelings, and that’s what often happens when you escape into your phone. So, she said, “We’re ethically bound to try to create the briefest interventions possible, with the biggest bang in terms of efficacy.”

To that end, she’s conducting studies to find out just how brief a session of Personal Zen can be without losing its efficacy. Her ideal is for people to play the game on their daily commute, just like they play Candy Crush — and then put their phones away.

That’s very different from what most app designers want, which is to “hook” users to maximize profit. But she says it would be ethically problematic to make an app that boosts engagement to the point that it’s addictive, and charge people struggling with mental illness to engage with that app.

Personal Zen just moved to a subscription model after being free for eight years. SuperBetter is still free. Mind Ease is free for now, but Greenberg said the plan is to eventually start charging a monthly fee — in some countries.

“We want to charge in the developed world, where people can afford to pay. In the developing world, we want to give the app away for free,” he said.

“I want to believe I feel better”

Mind Ease is one of several apps that asks users to rate their anxiety level before and after they complete an exercise. That allows the company to then advertise — to users and investors alike — that it’s helped reduce symptoms by a certain percentage. For example, after I did a progressive muscle relaxation and re-rated my feelings, Mind Ease told me: “Fantastic! The exercise helped you reduce your negative feelings by 50 percent, and your overall mood also improved by a factor of 1.13x. Great job!”

The thing is, after the exercise, I always feel there’s a cognitive bias pushing me to say that I feel better. That’s both because I want to believe I feel better and because of demand characteristics, the bias that happens when you feel you’ve figured out what the researchers’ expectation is and you want to fulfill that expectation, so you respond in a way that conforms to it.

So, does users’ self-reported decrease in anxiety really reflect more objective progress? Are we actually seeing our anxiety reduced, or are we just winning the game? Perhaps it doesn’t matter if there’s a placebo effect at work, because even so, the effect is positive?

Both McGonigal and Greenberg told me they doubt that it’s mostly a placebo, because the science on how CBT and mindfulness exercises work to reduce anxiety is well documented. But both also said that to the extent placebo is playing some role, that’s not a bad thing. “If people feel better because they think they’re supposed to, and all you’ve done is have them spend 10 minutes on an app, that’s among the more ethical ways to deliver a placebo effect,” McGonigal said.

For her part, Dennis-Tiwary leans toward more objective measures, like testing users’ levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the lab. “If your measure is a subjective slider on a scale from one to five, that’s not good, conclusive science,” she said. “If we’re selling a product and claiming it’s a mental health treatment, we cannot offer snake oil. There are already a lot of people [in tech] who are making land grabs with inaccurate claims and trying to make money off everyone’s suffering. We have to do better than that.”

There’s certainly an irony — some might say hypocrisy — in the tech world offering to solve a problem that it contributes to. Although we still need more data to determine the extent to which smartphone use may be driving increases in anxiety, it’s reasonable to suppose that technologies purposely designed to be addictive have at the very least been a contributing factor. So, even as we accumulate scientific evidence that some gamified apps are effective at reducing anxiety, we’d do well to think critically about how we use them.

McGonigal agrees that these apps need to be designed ethically, validated empirically, and used judiciously. But she has no doubt that for her, at least, turning the battle with anxiety into a game has taught her how to suffer less. With a laugh, she told me she’s just celebrated her “traumaversary,” the 10th anniversary of her concussion.

“I think I can finally say now — given the good that it led to — I’m happy it happened.”

The direct economic loss from the cancellation of more than 10 major tech conferences — including Google I/O, Facebook’s F8 event, Mobile World Congress, SXSW, and now the massive video gaming conference Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) — due to the coronavirus outbreak has surpassed $1.1 billion, according to estimates the data intelligence company PredictHQ pulled for Recode. That number doesn’t even include the amount of money that the respective companies would have made from hosting the events. The figure simply covers the losses to airlines, hotels, restaurants, and transportation providers that would normally make money from attendees’ purchases.

Some $480 million — the biggest loss — came from the cancellation of Mobile World Congress, which was supposed to host more than 100,000 attendees in Barcelona in February. That’s followed by SXSW, an Austin tech, music, and movie conference that had approximately 280,000 attendees last year and whose announced cancellation could result in $350 million in direct losses, according to PredictHQ. The Game Developers Conference, a 30,000-person event that was scheduled for March but has been postponed, could incur $129 million in losses. E3 is estimated to have a direct economic loss of $75 million. Google I/O, a 5,000-person developer conference, has a direct loss estimate of nearly $20 million.

While a number of events, including Facebook F8 and Adobe Summit, will still have an online component, that effort does not stave off the significant economic loss from canceling the physical event.

PredictHQ looks at losses from four categories: airfare, lodging, food, and transportation. That means this is a very conservative estimate since it doesn’t include losses incurred from, say, event sponsors, purchases that employees might have made, or ancillary impacts to the local economy.

PredictHQ said there was a 500 percent increase in major event cancellations and postponements last month, and the International Air Transport Association this month increased previous estimates for airline travel losses due to the coronavirus outbreak to as much as $113 billion.

Oxford Economics estimates that business conferences generate more than a trillion dollars in direct spending annually. So far these canceled tech conferences haven’t put a major dent in that. Still, both tech companies and consumers will be responsible for bearing the brunt of these conference-related losses, as most major insurance companies exclude communicable disease losses from reimbursement.

These cancellations come as nearly 5,000 people have died and more than 127,000 have been diagnosed with coronavirus. Numerous tech companies — including Google, Twitter, and Square — have told their employees to work from home. Several other major companies, like Amazon, have canceled nonessential travel, especially internationally, and are advising some workers to stay home. Accordingly, mentions of working from home skyrocketed last month in public company transcripts. If more companies follow these tech companies’ lead, the response to the coronavirus outbreak could result in a test of people’s ability to work at home en masse rather than in the office.

Meanwhile, Apple is still expected to hold its giant developer conferences later this spring. Recode’s own Code Conference is still scheduled for the end of May.

As the threat of coronavirus grows, it’s likely more companies big and small will decide to cancel their conferences. It remains to be seen how big those losses will be.

"['Rani Molla', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-12,How coronavirus took over social media,"As the new coronavirus pandemic sweeps the globe and people take to their homes to avoid getting and spreading the contagion, it makes sense that much of the conversation about it is taking place online. People are using the internet to share information, air their anxieties, and bide time while in quarantine. The moments when those online conversations light up also tell us a lot about how our feelings around the pandemic are evolving.

Here’s what the online conversation about the coronavirus outbreak has looked like so far

Mentions of “coronavirus” across social platforms and news media really started to take off in late February, according to social media analytics platform Sprinklr. That was after the first coronavirus case of unknown origin, also known as community spread, emerged in the United States. That case involved a patient in California who contracted coronavirus but had neither traveled somewhere where the virus was present nor was knowingly exposed to someone with the virus. At around the same time, South Korean pop band and social media sensation BTS announced it was canceling tour stops due to the coronavirus and urged their fans to donate to relief efforts.

The latest spike in mentions shows how conversation around the coronavirus has exploded this week. Sprinklr counted a record nearly 20 million mentions of coronavirus-related terms on March 11. For context on just how big that number is, mentions of the newly canceled NBA games were under 2 million and mentions of Trump were about 4 million on that day.

The rise followed a number of big news stories concerning the coronavirus. This month saw huge government quarantines as well as instructions not to gather in large groups as the number of global infections blew past 100,000. Last night, President Trump declared a ban on most travel from most of Europe — with locations where he owns resorts being the notable exception. At the same time, the NBA suspended games after a player tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and Tom Hanks also announced he’d tested positive. The top-performing Facebook post for the last 24 hours is currently a post by Donald Trump about the coronavirus.

Sprinklr noted that the emoji most commonly associated with the coronavirus in the past month has been crying laughing, followed by crying loudly and a large red dot, used mainly in Latin America, Spain, and France to represent a warning. The medical face mask emoji was No. 5, after the hand pointing down.

“With 19 million mentions across social media and news sites related to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours alone around the world, it’s clear that coronavirus is the first global pandemic that is unfolding on social media with unprecedented volumes of conversations happening every second,” Grad Conn, Sprinklr chief experience and marketing officer, told Recode. “Global social media usage rates have grown by about 50 percent since 2014, when the Ebola epidemic was happening worldwide. And recent major news stories — including climate change, sporting, and political events — have not had the same global impact as coronavirus on individuals, businesses, and governments.”

Brandwatch, another social media analytics company, found that sentiment surrounding coronavirus posts is, unsurprisingly, mostly negative. The most prevalent emotion has been disgust, with many of those mentions centering around hand-washing and racism toward Chinese people. The second-most-common emotion in these posts was fear. In many cases, these mentions centered on specific locations, like Italy and Iran, where the ravages of coronavirus have been most acutely felt.

Note that while Sprinklr and Brandwatch have global data, it is more representative of Americans due to the platforms they survey and the keywords they use.

People’s concerns about coronavirus have also been evident in their search history. Google searches of coronavirus in the US saw their first major rise relative to all search traffic toward the end of January, after the first person in the US was diagnosed with the coronavirus after traveling abroad. In recent days, coronavirus has seen its highest level of search traffic — that level is indicated by a score of 100 on Google Trends:

This is huge search volume by any measure. Here’s that same trend indexed against perennially popular Google searches of “Trump,” “music,” and “video” for the last two months:

“I haven’t seen anything like this,” Simon Rogers, data editor on the News Lab team at Google, told Recode, referring to the rapid rise in coronavirus searches but warning that he could be missing something.

More heartening, though, Rogers said much of the Google searches center around a clear desire for useful information.

“People are not panic searching,” Rogers said. “People are looking for reliable info like, ‘How long should I wash my hands?’”

Meanwhile, Google and other online platform have been actively trying to root out misinformation about coronavirus. YouTube has been particularly hard hit with hoaxes suggesting ways to prevent the virus and ads seeking to capitalize on it, both of which the company has been working to block.

The conversation is also in flux. Here’s a comparison of Google’s US search traffic in the first week of March (top blue) versus the first week of February (bottom red). In February, accelerating search terms related to coronavirus included a couple of misspellings of the virus — which is what you’d expect when a keyword or topic is newly popular — as well as mentions of coronavirus in relation to SARS as people were initially trying to put the outbreak into historical context.

This month so far, most of the rising searches — an indication of what’s new on people’s minds — had to do with specific locations as people sought to track down the virus as it hit their backyards.

The top coronavirus-related search was for “coronavirus satellite,” in reference to a series of news stories, including one by the New York Times, that used satellite imagery to illustrate the drastic impact coronavirus quarantines have had on public spaces, with formerly crowded destinations apparently barren. The comparison also shows that celebrity news is always popular: Before there was a false coronavirus rumor about Daniel Radcliffe, there was one about Eminem.

As the number of coronavirus infections continues to grow, so will our need to talk about it on social media. This is only the beginning of a very long public conversation.",vox,https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/12/21175570/coronavirus-covid-19-social-media-twitter-facebook-google
"['Alissa Wilkinson Aja Romano', 'Alissa Wilkinson', 'Aja Romano', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-06,South by Southwest 2020 has been canceled because of coronavirus,"On Friday, March 6, Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, Texas, announced that the film, music, and interactive industry conference South by Southwest (SXSW) will be canceled by executive order of the city due to fears about spreading the Covid-19 coronavirus.

SXSW was slated to run from March 13 through 22. The beloved convention, part tech conference, part entertainment festival, attracts hundreds of thousands of attendees each year. The cancellation marks the first time in 34 years that the convention will not take place.

“Based on the recommendation of our public health officer and our director of public health, and after our consultation with the city manager, I’ve gone ahead and declared a local disaster in the city,” Adler stated at a press conference Friday afternoon. “In association with that, I’ve issued an order that effectively cancels South by Southwest for this year.”

The executive order, issued by Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, applies countywide and cancels all local public festivals and events. The order will last for seven days, with the potential to be renewed as needed. Eckhardt called it a “data-driven decision” based on the coronavirus outlook.

Although Adler described the convention organizers as fully cooperative in their desire to work with the city, the official statement released by SXSW on Friday described organizers as “devastated” by the decision to cancel. “However, this situation evolved rapidly, and we honor and respect the City of Austin’s decision,” the statement read.

In the days leading up to the cancellation, more than 50,000 people had signed a Change.org petition asking the city to cancel the conference. Major media companies including Netflix, Apple, Amazon, and WarnerMedia had pulled films and planned talent appearances out of the festival. They joined a number of high-profile tech companies that had previously withdrawn from the festival, including Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Mashable, and Intel.

Netflix had planned to screen five films (Uncorked, A Secret Love, LA Originals, Mucho Mucho Amor, and Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics). It canceled all of those screenings, as well as a panel with Black-ish creator Kenya Barris and actor/producer Rashida Jones on their upcoming comedy series for the streaming network, #BlackExcellence.

Apple was set to premiere three AppleTV+ originals: Spike Jonze’s documentary Beastie Boys Story, an animated musical series called Central Park, and a docuseries called Homes. It also was going to screen the documentary Boys State, which it acquired at the Sundance Film Festival in January, and to host a panel on Little America with the series’ creators Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon.

Amazon canceled screenings and panels scheduled to promote its series Upload and the sci-fi drama Tales of the Loop. WarnerMedia announced via Twitter that it was also canceling “activations” planned for the festival.

The decision will be a costly one, both for the city of Austin in terms of lost revenue and for the many companies expected to attend.

Although there are so far no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Austin area, cases in Houston have been detected, and another Austin-based tech conference, Collision 2020, recently made the decision to postpone.

The news came shortly after the announcement that Seattle’s major comics convention, Emerald City Comic Con, scheduled to take place the same weekend as the beginning of SXSW, would be postponed until the summer.

"['Shirin Ghaffary', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-02-27,Austin shuts down SXSW as the number of canceled tech conferences rises,"The coronavirus is prompting major tech conferences around the world to cancel their events. So far, several ones have been called off entirely, including, on Friday, South by Southwest, a festival that attracted some 200,000 people last year, as well as Facebook’s F8 and Mobile World Congress. It’s an unprecedented disruption to the usual packed lineup of annual tech events every spring that’s having an economic impact of over $1 billion.

The cancellations of some of the biggest tech events of the year seem to be a sign of what’s to come in other sectors as fears mount that the coronavirus will become a pandemic. The US tech industry shares close ties to China, where the outbreak started, and some in the industry were so concerned about the virus that they took early precautions, like discouraging handshakes and requiring employees who have recently traveled to China to work from home.

Here’s a running list of notable tech conferences, which typically draw between 500 to 100,000 attendees a year, that have been canceled so far due to coronavirus:

South by Southwest in Austin, Texas

Mobile World Congress in Barcelona

Facebook Global Marketing Summit in San Francisco

Facebook F8 in San Jose, California

EmTech, Asia in Singapore

Google News Initiative Global Summit in Sunnyvale, California

Shopify’s developer conference, Unite, in Toronto

Google I/O in Mountain View, California

The tech event cancellations come at the same time public health leaders are considering how other, larger global events outside of tech, like the Tokyo summer Olympics, should respond if the outbreak continues to spread in the months ahead. Japan’s prime minister recently took the drastic step of closing all of the country’s schools for a month to try to contain the virus’s spread.

Covid-19 has taken the lives of 2,867 people as of Friday and infected more than 80,000 people. In the past week, the number of new cases of the virus outside of China, in the US, Italy, Japan, and other countries has been surging. That worries global health experts, who say there’s now less of a chance that it can be contained.

On Thursday, Facebook said that due to concerns about the virus, it’s canceling F8, its biggest event of the year, which last year attracted thousands of attendees from dozens of countries. Instead, it will put on smaller “locally hosted events, videos and live streamed content.”

F8 is one of several big tech conferences, including Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, that has been canceled altogether or negatively impacted due to coronavirus. On Thursday, Microsoft and Epic Games pulled out of one of the video game industry’s major conferences, Game Developers Conference, in San Francisco on March 16 to 17.

Industry leaders are particularly concerned about events in tech’s capital in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has some of the highest travel rates to and from China compared to other regions in the US. Earlier this month, Facebook canceled a 5,000-person marketing event in San Francisco scheduled in March due to similar concerns.

And on Tuesday, the mayor of San Francisco declared the city to be in a state of emergency, although there are still zero confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the city. Concerns are increasing after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that a person in Solano County, in Northern California, has been diagnosed with the virus who seemingly had no ties to anyone overseas with the disease, suggesting that the coronavirus may now be spreading person-to-person in the US.

Meanwhile, some other major tech conferences, such as the RSA IT security conference in San Francisco’s Moscone Center, which attracts some 40,000 attendees annually, carried on as planned this week and featured speakers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google. IBM, AT&T Cybersecurity, and Verizon, however, pulled out over coronavirus fears. Organizers reportedly encouraged attendees to knock elbows instead of shake hands and placed ample hand sanitizer stations in the conference halls.

Considering Facebook and other major tech companies have canceled or pulled out of conferences, it raises questions about whether other major conferences will do the same.

Apple is scheduled to have its major annual developer conference, WWDC, in June in San Jose, California. Apple did not reply to Recode’s request for comment about whether it plans to host its conference as scheduled.

Recode will host its annual Code tech conference in May in Los Angeles. The conference is considerably smaller than others that have been canceled, such as Mobile World Congress, which had more than 100,000 attendees last year.

“We are watching this closely to see what happens between now and the end of May. The health and safety of our community is of utmost importance to Recode and Vox Media,” Shannon Thompson, the executive director of conferences for Recode, said.",vox,https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/27/21156676/coronavirus-facebook-f8-canceled-major-tech-conferences-covid-19
"['Rebecca Jennings', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-06,Odd Job: This guy got a million TikTok followers. Now he tells brands how to do the same.,"Six months ago, very few people were making real money on TikTok, the video app and social network du jour for young creators and aspiring influencers. Brands hadn’t really begun to descend en masse, and the home feed was mostly free of anything hashtagged #ad. The main perks to being TikTok-famous were high viewership numbers, lots of likes, and maybe sometimes getting recognized in public.

It was only a matter of time, though, before companies and celebrities wanted in on the potentially more than a billion eyeballs scrolling through the app. By the fall of 2019, major campaigns from brands like Chipotle, ELF Cosmetics, and MAC became commonplace at the same time as A-listers like Will Smith hopped on board. Meanwhile, TikTok stars were landing lucrative talent deals and topping the music charts.

That’s created an opportunity for the people who were already TikTok savants. One of them is 26-year-old Sean Young, who has nearly a million followers under the username @seansaucetv. He’d already been big on Vine, the now-defunct six-second video app, and immediately went viral on TikTok with his signature highly produced “prank” videos and collaborations with other famous former Viners.

That’s not where he makes his money, though. Instead, Sean acts as a consultant for companies and celebs looking to build a presence on TikTok, while also running high-profile accounts like America’s Funniest Home Videos. Today, he’s pulling in $10,000 a month from being on TikTok four hours a day.

I caught up with Sean at a TikToker meetup on the Santa Monica Pier in Los Angeles, a favorite filming spot among influencers, where we chatted about how celebrities use TikTok to coincide with global film releases, what it’s like to tell famous people to do silly TikTok dances, and why silly videos perform better.

How did you first get big on TikTok?

It was right when VidCon happened [last June]. That was, like, the week I made my account. I saw my old Vine friends at VidCon, so I was able to make collabs with big creators. The first week I had my account, I had 100,000 followers. Luckily, I had the background of having 1.5 million followers on Vine, so I was able to blow up quickly.

TikTok reminded me of the Vines that I was making in 2014, when that used to be my full-time job. I was like, “I can just remake all that stuff.” In my first month, I already had a couple videos that went viral on TikTok and blew up everywhere else. It was a gold rush.

How’d you get into this business?

I was referred to America’s Funniest Home Videos by a friend who worked there. I started as an editor and saw that there were things they weren’t doing on Instagram, and once I took over the Instagram, I mentioned TikTok, and I turned it into this TikTok job.

Having AFV on my résumé was a good thing to have, but I’ve also run Instagram accounts for companies, so I’ve had friends thinking of me when it comes to that stuff. When I started getting on TikTok, all those people were like, “Hey, I have this musician or this person who wants to hop on the app, and I’ll have them email you.” Once I was on it, people started thinking of me as their TikTok guy.

The fact that I even have almost a million on my personal page, it’s just more credibility for me when I talk to brands and celebrities: “I know how to get your account the views you want. Trust me.”

When did business start to pick up?

Everything kind of happened at once in November and December. People were kind of unsure about TikTok, but everyone is up on it now and everyone wants to do it right. They’re actually reaching out to creators. It’s really taking off now.

I was getting referred to really big YouTubers, people on Facebook, and even A-list celebrities to help them with their TikTok launch. People who were established in other places, they might have a team that helps them on other platforms, but when it came to TikTok, they wanted someone who specialized in that.

How much money do you pull in in about a month?

December and this month are the first months I’ve made over $10,000. If everything goes how it’s going right now, I’ll make close to $150,000 or $200,000 [a year] hopefully. Coming from last year, I wasn’t really on TikTok and I was a washed-up Viner and now I have knowledge of making content on the internet, but now I just do it for brands.

Right now, maybe 10 percent of what I make is from my personal account, but I’m hoping to get that number closer to 50 percent. But I enjoy the stability of working at AFV. I just got a brand deal for the card game What Do You Meme? A lot of the musicians I’m working with, I’m also doing song deals in the background of my videos.

“Celebrities want to have a global box office hit, and TikTok’s big in China and India”

What kinds of things do you advise brands and celebrities to do?

I steer them away from posting content that isn’t relevant to the app. When it comes to celebrities and musicians, people don’t even care about the content to some degree, they just want to see that that person is embracing the app. They can do the dumbest TikTok trends that are only relevant to the app — it just shows that they have knowledge of it. We focus on what trends can apply to talent. They don’t know anything about TikTok, we’re telling them exactly what to do, but the millions of fans will think that the person’s on the app watching silly lip-sync videos.

What are those meetings like? Why do they say they’re joining TikTok?

I’m just on the phone. I don’t really meet them in person; I never do. That’s why it almost doesn’t feel real. Everything’s through my phone. It’s surreal to me that it’s actually happened.

What celebrities have you worked with?

I’m not allowed to talk about which ones, [but I’ve worked with] four of them.

Why do they say they’re joining TikTok?

The potential of it. The Charli D’Amelios and those kinds of people are getting so big on every single platform from TikTok, and it’s reminiscent of the old Vine groups like the Magcon kids.

For some of the other celebrities, they want to have a global box office hit, and TikTok’s big in China and India. There’s a huge audience in India, that’s why it’s so good for musicians and people who want streaming numbers. If you want a global audience, TikTok’s the new place.

Is there a whole community of TikTok consultants?

Honestly, there are very few. Cosette [Rinab, @cosette] is the only one I know. I know her boyfriend from Vine, and I caught up with him randomly and he told me that his girlfriend does that stuff, and he put us in touch. Now she’s passing me clients.

What’s the secret to TikTok fame?

The app is so weird. The For You page is definitely catered toward kids, so you have to be really PG, but at the same time you have to be universally funny. Content that doesn’t require language or dialogue but uses sounds and music is a big part of it.

What content does best?

I make the stupidest videos for TikTok because the audience is so young, and I get a lot of hate comments, but I don’t care. Even when people comment, “This is stupid,” it’s helping it get to the For You page. So when I started playing into it, like purposely make these stupid videos, every meme page in the world posted me. So that’s kind of like the new strategy. You’ve got to play into it.

“I make the stupidest videos for TikTok because the audience is so young, and I get a lot of hate comments, but I don’t care”

What’s the hardest part about your job?

Trying not to be burned out. There’s so much happening at all times. The life span of a video is, like, two days. Every account and new client that I’m working with, it’s trying to keep them up and going at all times and keeping them in mind whenever I’m watching videos. Between my two iPhones for work and my iPad, I’m on TikTok alone for four hours a day.

What’s your ultimate goal?

I don’t want to be in front of the camera. I’d rather be behind the scenes making sure everyone’s doing their job. I have a company, VRTCL, and my goal is to sell it. Record labels have their own traditional marketing, but if they could have their own TikTok wing, we could run campaigns for every song that gets released. We have in-house influencers who we work with all the time, and every song would have 26 TikToks made that helps blow it up. Having that built into a record label is really next-level. That same company can have relationships with TV shows and movies for promotion and doing all of that under one name.

What do you think the future of TikTok consulting holds?

I think it’s teenagers and little kids running A-list celebrities’ accounts. Kids are so smart, they’re growing up with this stuff, and they know the trends better than anyone. It’s not too hard, there’s a lot of strategy that goes into it, but these kids know how to do everything, and they’re all popular themselves, too. I’m really scared that a 12-year-old or a 13-year-old will take my job in a couple years. That’s why I’m grinding so hard now.",vox,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/6/21155067/how-to-make-money-on-tiktok-consultant-seansaucetv
"['Allegra Frank Daniel Markus', 'Allegra Frank', 'Daniel Markus', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-05,How the coronavirus rumor mill can thrive in private group chats,"With the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak still so new, fear of the death and disruption it could cause rapidly mounting, and treatments for it still a big question mark, rumors and misinformation about the outbreak are starting to spread.

A wary public might be especially susceptible to believing unverified rumors about how the outbreak began (nope, the new coronavirus wasn’t created in a lab) or taking misguided measures to protect themselves (unless you’re sick or caring for someone who is, face masks aren’t the answer!). And buying into alarmist falsehoods can be dangerous.

The spread of misinformation is already commonplace on social media, where the sharing of content from biased sources frequently outpaces whatever fact-checking and moderation safeguards are in place. Which is why coronavirus myths are starting to crop up on both Facebook and Twitter, along with YouTube and TikTok and messaging apps like WhatsApp.

YouTube videos advertising the “truth” about the virus are showing up in people’s recommended video feeds, and there are millions of tweets alleging that the US government played a role in creating the virus. Your aunt’s best buddy that you are friends with on Facebook with could very well be sharing a highly questionable article about how coronavirus will definitely kill you soon, right this moment. (Go check your Facebook feed. I’ll wait.)

There are a lot of things we genuinely don’t know yet about the coronavirus, and for the makers of those platforms, distinguishing the right details from the wrong ones is a difficult process. That difficulty multiples when the misinformation is dispersed in private groups.

For example: Anti-vaxxers regularly gather in invite-only Facebook groups to share damaging rhetoric about vaccinations, which can later make its way to the feeds of Facebook users who aren’t in those groups. The contained anti-vaxx group is harder to police than the general newsfeed, allowing misinformation to proliferate. There are reports that similar groups are now circulating hoax-like content about the coronavirus, sending users panicking behind closed doors for reasons that may not be based in reality.

Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok have all pledged to stop these posts from traveling widely, according to Recode. In the case of Facebook specifically, CEO Mark Zuckerberg published a lengthy statement on March 3, pledging that Facebook will flag any info that needs to be fact-checked, and that it will also block ads from shady enterprises attempting to prey on people’s fears. The extent to which any of these companies can adequately prevent misinformation from spreading remains unseen, but the commitment is encouraging.

But with private messages and group chats, where friends and family members might discuss everything from gossip to more serious matters, successful moderation of health crisis fear-mongering can seem impossible.

The rumors on messaging apps sometimes make their way offline like they’re part of a game of telephone. A link shared in one group can easily be passed along by one of its members to another group, and another, until there are numerous people who don’t even use WhatsApp who stopped going to that restaurant in Chinatown where they’re sure a cook had coronavirus.

The sourcing for these stories is usually non-existent — that’s how rumors work — but their ramifications are heavy. East Asian-owned businesses are losing customers as a result, according to recent reports from the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. That’s in large part due to xenophobia surrounding the coronavirus. But in some cases, it’s because patrons of these businesses are themselves spreading stories that aren’t based in fact.

In one bizarre but poignant case reported by Matthew Kang at Eater, several specific restaurants in Los Angeles’s Koreatown neighborhood have seen business drop off by over 50 percent, thanks to a rumor spread via KakaoTalk.

KakaoTalk is an app similar to WhatsApp that’s popular among Korean speakers both in South Korea and the US; users from both countries shared a simplistic Instagram screenshot across the platform, an image that named places an allegedly infected flight attendant visited during a layover in Los Angeles. The post set off hysteria that eating at those restaurants could cause coronavirus infections, and suddenly, many Koreans in L.A. were avoiding them en masse. There was no truth to any part of the story, but hearsay overpowered reality; such is the power of the group chat groupthink.

But therein lies the problem: Although it’s not encrypted to the same extent that WhatsApp is, KakaoTalk is similarly private and similarly unmoderated. Social media companies can control content on their public platforms to some extent, but when it comes to private messages, DMs, and group chats, the right to privacy works against attempts to prevent false info that might be going around.

So should social media companies be stepping in to stop people from (sometimes unknowingly) spreading rumors that obscure the truth about an impending global crisis? Or is the onus on the people in the group chats?

These aren’t easy or simple questions to answer. But in Thursday’s episode of Recode’s podcast Reset, I spoke to someone who tried their best. Russell Brandom is a policy editor at The Verge, where he covers regulatory practices in politics, technology, culture, and beyond. Below is a lightly edited segment of our conversation, in which we discussed where responsibility lies to blunt dangerous misinformation from spreading in private messages and group chats.

Allegra Frank

There are a lot of gray areas when it comes to enforcing freedom of speech on social media. And one place where I feel like it’s especially tricky is with insular communities, like encrypted and private channels and websites — such as Facebook groups and messaging apps.

In these places, there isn’t moderation to the same extent that there is on more public platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook. There can’t be, because it would be a violation of privacy to have companies surveil our messages. So could misinformation be more harmful and easily spread in these encrypted messaging apps, where there isn’t that same moderation scale as on more publicly visible timelines?

Russell Brandom

The way that I think about it is that censorship is kind of this dirty word, like, you say it and people straighten up. But in a very basic sense, if someone is trying to say something in a channel, and you’re like, maybe don’t say that, that’s censorship. That doesn’t have to be bad, though. I think that censorship is less harmful as you get to the bigger and bigger channels.

If you’re going on national broadcast news and everyone with an antenna can get it and you’re using public airwaves to share misinformation, then it makes sense for there to be this higher standard of what is acceptable speech. If someone is sharing incorrect information in a video that’s going on YouTube, and it’s going to be promoted algorithmically to millions of people, it actually does make sense that YouTube should be the one taking responsibility for what it’s promoting in that way.

[The situation gets trickier] when you get into these encrypted group chats. Say it’s a one-on-one thing — I’m just going to pick up my phone and send this link about the coronavirus to you, Allegra. What if the messaging app is then going to say, “No, you’re not allowed to send that link”? That seems messed up.

Allegra Frank

Right, because as private citizens, we’re not comfortable with the moderation options that are more analogous to surveillance. So is it on us to vet and stop the spread of mistruths? I mean, I think the answer Facebook would give us is yes. But what is the responsibility of users, specifically, to actually try tamping down on this misinformation — when it comes to something as broadly dangerous and impactful as global health crises, at least?

Russell Brandom

I don’t know that just bystander intervention is really a good strategy. Is it enough if I’m going to sit down with my loopy aunt and have a real talk about the things she’s sharing on the internet? I mean, that’s fine. I’m less troubled by someone sharing something that’s false than sharing something that could hurt someone. And that’s a lot of what we’re talking about when we talk about misinformation, is that your child could get measles and get horribly sick. It’s not just that someone has this belief that I consider incorrect. There’s concrete harm that’s directly related to the thing they’re sharing.

That’s also [true] if someone shares something that could inflame existing societal tensions that result in this mob violence. If someone is sharing something that’s going to make people freak out and panic about coronavirus and then do something that will hurt themselves or others — that, to me, always feels more urgent.

And even if the sender resists when the people they shared those coronavirus myths or other incendiary links with respond to debunk the claims, the sender has to understand where those people are coming from. They’re coming from a place of concern for others rather than just being like, “You’re an idiot. I hold very different political beliefs than you.”

It seems that ultimately, misinformation is such a big problem in this day and age, and we’re still trying to figure out the best way to combat it. So the most we can do is, I think, continue having these conversations.

Facebook, in particular, continues to update its policies as the outbreak — and corresponding disinformation — spreads.

On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg reiterated in a Facebook post that the platform was removing conspiracy theories related to the coronavirus that have been flagged by global health organizations, in addition to labeling coronavirus misinformation with “fact check” labels to let users know that such content had been rated false. Zuckerberg also said that Facebook is providing the World Health Organization (WHO) “as many free ads as they need.” At the same time, Zuckerberg said the company will block ads that try to exploit the situation, such as those that claim a product has a miracle cure for the Covid-19 disease.

It’s been more than two months since a novel strain of coronavirus popped up in Wuhan, China, and proceeded to spread to countries across the world. And as that’s happened, panic has continued to disseminate throughout social media, forcing tech platforms to grapple with what the World Health Organization is calling an “infodemic.”

As of March 4, the novel coronavirus linked to Wuhan, China, has infected nearly 95,000 people, mostly in mainland China, and there are cases popping up throughout the United States. More than 3,200 people have died, though researchers at Johns Hopkins tracking the disease also report more than 51,000 recoveries from the illness.

With more and more people searching online for information about the coronavirus outbreak, they can easily encounter a barrage of misleading and potentially dangerous information. And the WHO, which has also released its own “myth-busting” resources, is warning that misinformation about the novel coronavirus has caused harmful stigmatization and discrimination. In the US, for instance, there is a growing number of reports about misinformation fueling racism against Asian Americans.

Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok have all told Recode that they’ve been working to promote factual content and some are limiting the reach of posts with misinformation on their platforms. Twitter, for instance, has put a warning label linking to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) when users search “coronavirus.” Meanwhile, the WHO has now joined TikTok in an effort to boost accurate information about the illness, and several of those companies met with the public health organization at Facebook back in February.

The CDC recommends several measures to help prevent the spread of Covid-19: Wash your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw it in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects.

Stay home as much as possible, and do not go out if you are sick.

Wear at least a cloth mask in certain public settings.

Contact a health worker if you have symptoms. Guidance may change. Stay informed, and stay safe, with Vox’s coronavirus coverage hub.

Still, efforts by these social media platforms have not managed to stop the spread of misleading or outright false hoaxes about the outbreak in the form of posts and videos that have racked up thousands of clicks, “Likes,” and shares. A significant amount of false information about the coronavirus is also spreading on private channels. Take WhatsApp, for instance. As the Washington Post reported, the encrypted platform has seen a flurry of wrong information about the coronavirus, creating panic among its users throughout the world.

Another problem involves politicians promoting the idea that the coronavirus is a hoax or spreading other conspiracy theories about the virus. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Recode that the company would remove false claims and conspiracy theories flagged by world health organizations that have been shared by politicians or elected officials.

While we’re seeing a wide variety of false coronavirus posts across these platforms, it’s still hard to say how widespread the misinformation problem is. But it’s significant enough that well-regarded institutions, including Johns Hopkins University, research centers in England, and even NASA have had to issue statements or comments debunking claims that have been floated online. Advocacy groups such as Media Matters have also been busy tracking down false and misleading posts.

Although there is a seemingly endless stream of sources spreading misinformation about the Wuhan coronavirus around the web, we’ve identified and debunked a few of the most pervasive hoaxes.

False: The novel coronavirus sickness is caused by 5G

On social media, some are pushing the idea that the novel coronavirus was caused by or can be linked to deployment of 5G technology in Wuhan, China. There are several “strains” of this theory floating around online. One premise is that 5G technology can weaken the immune system and make the common cold more virulent. Another promotes the idea that the 5G technology itself is causing the symptoms that have been attributed to the novel coronavirus. One version of the theory pushes the idea that the technology absorbs oxygen in the lungs, which “causes coronavirus.”

That idea has been flagged false by a UK-based third-party fact-checker, called Full Fact, that works with Facebook. There’s no evidence that 5G impacts the immune system, and no proof that it has any link to the novel coronavirus.

False: There’s a plot to “exterminate” people infected with the new coronavirus

On social media, some have floated the claim that China sought permission from the country’s Supreme Court to kill people infected with the novel coronavirus. Several fact-checkers, including Snopes, have determined these reports to be false and to have originated from a website with several “red flags.”

Poynter observed that some social media accounts continue to push the idea that China is planning to kill people with the illness. Meanwhile, some accounts have floated that the idea that the incineration of human bodies is causing an excess of sulfur dioxide, which they imply can be seen from satellite images. There is no evidence that any of this is true, and a research meteorologist from NASA told the UK fact-checking organization Full Fact that the images these theories are based on aren’t live satellite data.

“Although satellite data has been used in the construction of the emission inventories, these emissions do not account for the day-to-day variations in SO2 emissions and as such cannot account for sudden changes in human activity,” Arlindo M. da Silva told the fact-checking organization.

False: Scientists have proven that humans got the novel coronavirus from eating bats

One prominent theory is that the coronavirus spread through human consumption of bats. BuzzFeed reported that a prominent video about the novel coronavirus in Hindi that’s attracted more than 13 million amplified the claim that eating bats caused the coronavirus outbreak. This theory, which has popped up throughout social media, is also linked to unfounded speculation that the coronavirus was started at the Wuhan Virology Institute.

Those claims have helped fuel racism against people of Chinese descent, and Asian people more broadly, throughout the world.

It’s true that there has been research into a potential link between bats and the coronavirus, but it’s important to be very cautious in interpreting the findings. First, there is no evidence that eating bats caused the coronavirus outbreak. And Jonathan Epstein, a veterinarian and an epidemiologist EcoHealth Alliance, told Vox earlier this month that it’s “still not known” whether this outbreak started with bats at an animal market.

“It’s clear there was some environmental contamination in the market that includes this virus. And that’s what we know so far. So it’s likely that people were infected in that market,” Epstein told Vox. “But I think there is still some question about how the earlier cases may have been exposed.”

And here’s what the CDC reports: “Analysis of the genetic tree of this virus indicates it originated in bats, but whether the virus jumped directly from bats or whether there was an intermediary animal host is not, yet, known.”

False: Scientists predicted the virus will kill 65 million people

In October 2019, a Johns Hopkins research center ran an “exercise” that aimed to model the global response to a potential epidemic. Many people online have misinterpreted the study and erroneously linked its predictions to the possible death toll of an outbreak similar to what we’re currently witnessing with the novel coronavirus. In other words, the Johns Hopkins study had nothing to do with the coronavirus, although the scenario studied might seem similar.

This is a popular line of misinformation on Twitter. There are several tweets, including one that’s still up with over 140,000 “likes,” claiming that scientists have predicted that the Wuhan coronavirus will kill 65 million people. That’s not accurate.

“We modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction,” the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said in a statement. “We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people.”

False: China built a biological weapon that was leaked from a lab in Wuhan

Right now, it’s not clear where this new strain of coronavirus originated. Officials believe it may be linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, but scientists still aren’t exactly sure how or where it developed.

On social media, however, there are many other completely unproven theories about its origin that imply the outbreak of the virus may be linked to bioweapons research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a research institute that houses the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory. This Facebook post that’s been shared more than 4,000 times says that it’s “believed that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is where the disease may have originated.”

This idea appears to be based, in part, on comments a former Israeli military officer shared with the Washington Times, a right-wing outlet whose past articles have suggested that President Barack Obama might be Muslim and have spread conspiracy theories. Back in January Jim Banks, a Republican congressman from Indiana, even tweeted out a link to the Washington Times article. His tweet has been shared more than 1,000 times. (Rep. Banks did not respond to a request for comment.) And this month, Sen. Tom Cotton also amplified similar speculations.

As shocking as the biowarfare lab theory might be, experts have told the Washington Post that there’s no evidence to support it. And the lab itself said in a statement that misinformation had “caused severe damage to our researchers who have been dedicated to working on the front line, and seriously interrupted the emergency research we are doing during the epidemic.”

False: Chinese spies smuggled the virus out of Canada

Social media posts are pushing the unproven premise that the novel coronavirus found in Wuhan was smuggled from a lab in Canada as part of China’s clandestine quest for a bioweapon, a theory debunked by Politifact. It’s a theory that seems to be somewhat related to the Wuhan lab conspiracy. One tweet by Republican Party official Solomon Yue, who has more than 100,000 followers, said: “#coronavirus is stolen from Canada by espionage & sent to Wuhan to be weaponized to kill foreign enemies.”

#coronavirus is stolen from Canada by espionage & sent to Wuhan to be weaponized to kill foreign enemies. Now the deadly weaponized virus kills 80 Chinese & no foreigners & becomes Emperor Shithole's Chernobyl! https://t.co/aOyIbvmC39 — Solomon Yue (@SolomonYue) January 27, 2020

Although a Chinese researcher working in Canada is under investigation for a possible policy breach after she was invited to the Wuhan lab twice a year for two years, according to Politifact, there’s “no evidence” to support the claim that she “stole coronavirus samples and gave them to the Wuhan lab to create biological weapons.”

False: A coronavirus vaccine already exists

Another popular theory is that a vaccine for the novel coronavirus already exists, and some are even suggesting that the vaccine was previously patented. While researchers in several countries are working to develop a vaccine, no such vaccine has yet been developed, according to FactCheck.org and Politifact. But this hasn’t stopped people from going online and claiming otherwise.

A recent post on Facebook claims that the coronavirus was a “set up” to sell vaccines and includes screenshots claiming to show a patent for a new vaccine. In this particular case, because Facebook’s fact-checkers verified the post as containing false information, a handful of “related articles” show up below the post, pointing users to verified sites that debunk the vaccine conspiracy theory. If you try to share the post, Facebook issues a warning stating that independent fact-checkers have said it contains false information.

But even though Facebook has placed warnings on some vaccine hoaxes related to the Wuhan coronavirus, the content isn’t flagged as false on every platform. On Twitter, for example, one tweet that’s gained close to 2,000 “likes” suggests that a vaccine for the coronavirus is owned by the Pirbright Institute, an English infectious disease research institute that focuses on farm animals.

This claim is false. The Pirbright Institute issued a statement shared by FactCheck.org, clarifying that its researchers don’t work with human coronaviruses, and that a patent that they hold is unrelated to the current coronavirus linked to Wuhan.

Some have also attempted to profit from spreading the false information that’s there’s a cure (there’s none yet), and the Federal Trade Commission warned the public earlier this month that “scammers are taking advantage of fears” about the illness and “setting up websites to sell bogus products, and using fake emails, texts, and social media posts as a ruse to take your money and get your personal information.

False: There were 100,000 confirmed cases in January

As of March 4, there were nearly 95,000 cases of the coronavirus, but at the very end of January, when that number was less than 10,000, people were vastly inflating the number of infected people beyond what any official source has reported.

It’s an important reminder that, when trying to figure out the scale of the virus’s spread, it’s worth looking to reputable, official sources, such as the World Health Organization. The Center for Systems Science and Engineer at Johns Hopkins also maintains a useful map documenting the number of confirmed cases throughout the world.

It’s true that on January 26, one public health expert told the Guardian, however, “Almost certainly many tens of thousands of people are infected.” He added, “My best guess now is perhaps 100,000 cases right now.” But that big scary number can be misleading because it was a guess and that number had not been confirmed.

Nevertheless, many popular posts on social platforms spread statistics that served to scare people with numbers that do not match the official count. Some of these posts cite medical workers in Wuhan, without evidence. For instance, one YouTube video posted on January 25 shows someone identified as a nurse, who says there were as many as 90,000 people infected with the disease in China alone.

Similarly, in late January on Twitter, an account disguised as a news outlet shared an audio clip that claimed that the time, 100,000 people have been infected.

It’s worth noting that there’s legitimate doubt about whether the Chinese government is accurately reporting the extent of the virus’ impact. At least eight people have been arrested by the Chinese government for spreading hoaxes, according to reporting from the Poynter Institute in January. On the popular Chinese social media app WeChat, some have said that frontline reports by medical workers are being taken down.

Still, the exact number of people infected by the coronavirus remains unknown.

False: A teen on TikTok is the first case in Canada

On TikTok, some teenagers have pretended to be infected with the virus. One student in Vancouver posted a popular video falsely claiming his friend had the first Canadian confirmed case of coronavirus. The video showed a teenager vomiting in school trash cans and wearing a mask around campus. In an interview with the Daily Beast, a spokesperson for the British Columbia Department of Health confirmed that the video is fake. At the time, the only confirmed case of coronavirus in British Columbia, at the time of the video was posted, was a man in his 40s.

TikTok appears to have deleted the original viral video which had over 4.1 million views, but a similar video, posted by the same user, showed a teen alleging a classmate had contracted the virus remained up as of February 20. That morning, the company said it released a feature directing users to trusted sources of information, like the WHO, when they search for coronavirus-related content in the app.

False: The Chinese government built a hospital overnight

It’s worth noting that the Chinese state media has also been spreading false information. As BuzzFeed News first pointed out, two state media outlets — Global Times and People’s Daily — circulated an image of a newly constructed building and claimed it was a hospital in Wuhan that was constructed in just 16 hours. In fact, the building in the image was an apartment building more than 600 miles away.

This is just one example of how the Chinese government and state-backed organizations have used false or misleading information to portray the outbreak as being under control.

How tech platforms are responding

Every social media company Recode reached said they were working to reduce the impact of false information about the coronavirus in some way, to varying extents.

In addition to taking down conspiracy theories and provided WHO free advertising, Facebook said it’s also working on “blocking people from running ads that try to exploit the situation.” Zuckerberg said, as an example, that would include a company promoting a product that claimed to cure a disease. He also said,: “Researchers are already using aggregated and anonymized Facebook data — including mobility data and population density maps — to better understand how the virus is spreading.

In a statement, Twitter appeared to echo some of the latest steps being taken by Facebook. The company said it would “halt any attempt by advertisers to opportunistically use the Covid-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads,” that it was working with fact checkers to promote accurate content on the site, and that it was also supplying data to researchers.

Twitter also said it’s not “seeing significant coordinated platform manipulation efforts around these issues.” This doesn’t mean that there’s not false information about coronavirus on Twitter, as the hoaxes we mentioned earlier prove. Twitter’s response simply indicates that the company hasn’t found any evidence of intentional disinformation campaigns by someone, like a state actor or political group.

In the early days of the outbreak, Facebook’s approach was to put fact-checking alerts on false content related to conspiracy theories. But at the end of January, the company announced that it would take additional action:

We will also start to remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them. We are doing this as an extension of our existing policies to remove content that could cause physical harm. We’re focusing on claims that are designed to discourage treatment or taking appropriate precautions. This includes claims related to false cures or prevention methods — like drinking bleach cures the coronavirus — or claims that create confusion about health resources that are available. We will also block or restrict hashtags used to spread misinformation on Instagram, and are conducting proactive sweeps to find and remove as much of this content as we can.

Twitter has also placed a warning label linking to the CDC when users search “coronavirus.”

Meanwhile, starting in late January, TikTok began issuing a notification for users when they search for the “coronavirus” hashtag in the app. The alert encourages users to look to “trusted sources” like the WHO for accurate information and to report content that might violate its community guidelines. TikTok told Recode in a statement that its guidelines “do not permit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public,” adding that “[w]hile we encourage our users to have respectful conversations about the subjects that matter to them, we remove deliberate attempts to misrepresent authoritative sources of news.”

YouTube has its own version of an advisory. Beginning in late January, the video platform began showing short previews of text-based news articles about the coronavirus in search results. If you search “coronavirus” on YouTube, for example, you’re linked to a WHO landing page about the novel coronavirus. YouTube told Recode that false information generally does not violate the platform’s rules unless it involves hate speech, harassment, scams, or inciting violence. The company also said it aims to reduce the recommendations of what it deems “borderline content” or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways — including false information about coronavirus.

Despite these efforts, it’s seemingly impossible for these platforms to take down every false coronavirus post as soon as one pops up. As with any kind of misinformation, it’s a game of never-ending whack-a-mole. But the continued prevalence of false info about the outbreak, one month into its existence, shows how essential it is to contain the spread of misinformation, especially with serious health consequences involved.

"['Aaron Rupar', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-03,Facebook’s top news stories are like a window into an alternate dimension,"There are a lot of consequential and important things going on. Not only is today Super Tuesday, but Americans are on edge about the spread of the novel coronavirus that could reach pandemic proportions.

But if you consume your news on Facebook, the biggest news of the day has to do with Hillary Clinton’s emails. Yes, really.

According to data compiled by CrowdTangle, the most total interactions on Facebook came on a Fox News article about a federal judge granting a request from a right-wing group named Judicial Watch to make Clinton sit for a sworn deposition about her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.

In fact, as this is written early Tuesday afternoon, stories from right-wing sources about Clinton’s emails represent three of the top 10 and five of the 20 top-performing news stories on Facebook over the past 24 hours. The No. 4 story of the day is one about Clinton’s emails from Breitbart, and the eighth-ranked story is one on the same topic from Dan Bongino’s website. Coverage of her emails from National Review and Ben Shapiro also appear in the top 20.

What you won’t find in Facebook’s top 20 news stories, however, is Super Tuesday coverage, anything published by a left-of-center outlet, or anything that’s critical of President Donald Trump or his administration.

Here’s a look at the full top 20 Facebook stories:

1 — Fox News story about Clinton’s emails 2 — CNN story about Australian wildfires 3 — CNN story about coronavirus 4 — Breitbart story about Clinton’s emails 5 — Daily Mail story about new Krispy Kreme doughnut 6 — Fox News story about Monday’s stock market rebound 7 — Ben Shapiro story on Monday’s stock market rebound 8 — Dan Bongino story on Clinton’s emails 9 — Fox News story comparing Bernie Sanders with Hugo Chávez 10 — CNN story on Apple iPhone settlement 11 — Fox News story about Chris Matthews’s retirement 12 — Robert Reich’s post on CNN story about John Lewis’s surprise appearance in Selma 13 — National Review story about Clinton’s emails 14 — BBC News story on Putin trying to ban same-sex marriage in Russia 15 — Bernie Sanders post with link to polling places info 16 — NBC News story story about UPS worker planning mass shooting 17 — TMZ story about Kobe Bryant’s death 18 — Ben Shapiro story on Clinton’s emails 19 — Dan Bongino story about Devin Nunes wanting to subpoena law enforcement and intelligence community officials 20 — NBC story about coronavirus

Facebook has been reluctant to crack down on right-wing media

What explains the predominance of right-wing outlets on Facebook? According to Judd Legum, who reports extensively on Facebook in his Popular Information newsletter, part of the answer has to do with the sort of content that’s optimized for Facebook.

“Facebook is optimized for Trump supporters,” Legum wrote in a direct message. “It rewards engagement, which mostly reflects an emotional reaction to things. Support for Trump is largely emotional, not factual. So pro-Trump content does very very well.”

Chicanery could also be playing a role. Legum has detailed how Ben Shapiro’s Daily Wire spreads its content around Facebook with help from “a clandestine network of 14 large Facebook pages that purport to be independent but exclusively promote content from The Daily Wire in a coordinated fashion.” That sort of “inauthentic coordinated behavior” seemingly violates Facebook rules, but the Daily Wire gets away with it anyway.

Parker Molloy, editor at large for Media Matters, argued that Facebook “is essentially afraid of conservatives,” and noted that the group of third-party sites that fact-check news posts for the network includes right-wing ones like the Daily Caller and Breitbart.

“Facebook gives them free rein to set the online agenda,” Molloy told Vox.

The irony is that even as the right wing dominates the news marketplaces on Facebook, Republicans like Donald Trump Jr., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Sen. Josh Hawley continue to push baseless conspiracy theories about Republicans being victimized by left-wing bias among the social media and tech behemoths.

During last week’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), for instance, Trump Jr., McCarthy, and Hawley hosted an event in which the president’s son accused Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, of being biased against Republicans because he searched his handle and couldn’t quickly find his account — a development he attributed to Instagram execs trying to silence him.

Despite what Don Jr. would have you believe, conservatives’ voices are the loudest on Facebook. According to an investigation put together last year by David Uberti for Vice:

Fox News’ main Facebook page, with 17 million followers, has racked up 80 percent more reactions, comments, and shares than CNN, which has 31 million followers. The Fox page’s engagement rate — the average number of engagements per post per follower — was higher than any major news organization over the same period, and some five times that of The New York Times.

"['Sara Morrison', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Mar']",2020-03-02,"Apple’s $500 million iPhone settlement, briefly explained","Apple has agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle a class action lawsuit over its phone batteries — and you might get a (small) cut of that.

According to Reuters, Apple will pay qualified iPhone owners $25 per phone, although this amount could be adjusted depending on how many claims are filed. (Think of that Equifax settlement that was supposed to give us $125 each, except so many people submitted a claim that it was significantly reduced). Nevertheless, the minimum amount that Apple must pay out will be at least $310 million.

The settlement will cover models 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, and SE devices that installed the software updates before December 21, 2017. If that’s you, don’t spend that $25 yet — the settlement still has to be approved by a federal judge.

The settlement puts a punctuation mark on what became known as “Batterygate.” In 2016, iPhone 6s owners began complaining that their phones suddenly shut down despite having plenty of battery life remaining. Apple eventually responded by admitting that a “very small number” of the iPhone 6s had an issue with their batteries and offering free battery replacements to those models. Then, owners of other iPhone models claimed that their devices were having similar shutdown issues and that the problem was more widespread than Apple would admit. Apple responded with a software update that reduced the number of shutdowns significantly.

But by December 2017, Apple was forced to admit that the update had fixed the problem by throttling the phone’s performance. Apple said it was merely trying to compensate for the degradation that naturally comes with aging batteries. Many customers, however, believed the company was really trying to force them to purchase new phones by making their old ones that much harder to use. Apple’s lack of transparency — that is, its only acknowledging problems after a preponderance of evidence made them impossible to deny and not telling users that the software updates would slow their phones down — didn’t help its case.

In response to a growing outcry, Apple apologized and offered to replace batteries in certain phones for $29 — cheaper than the usual $79 price tag, but not free. It also released another software update that allowed users to turn off the throttling feature.

Customers were not placated by this. Multiple class action lawsuits were filed in the US and were later consolidated into this one lawsuit, which Apple is now settling. Countries including France and Italy fined Apple millions of dollars over this issue, but those fines pale in comparison to the $500 million Apple will now pay out. Then again, according to its latest earnings report, Apple has over $207 billion in cash on hand, so half a billion bucks might not seem like a big deal to the company.

All this still hasn’t stopped Apple from throttling aging iPhones. The company said in November 2018 that the practice would continue for the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X models, explaining in a note to Congress that doing so would provide users with “a more advanced performance management system that more precisely allows iOS to anticipate and avoid an unexpected shutdown.” The difference now is that it would inform consumers that it was doing so — something it did not do before, and which raised the ire of consumers who perhaps would not have updated their software if they had known how it would affect their phones’ performance.

Still, the symbolic impact of such a large settlement might lead some to wonder how Apple feels about recent pressure from Washington over antitrust concerns. After all, Apple is no stranger to lawsuits over anticompetitive behavior. In 2016, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice over price fixing its ebooks to the tune of $450 million, with customers receiving between $1.57 and $6.93 per book. That case dragged out over several years, with Apple taking it all the way to the US Supreme Court — a much different response from this agreement to settle without admitting fault.

“In this case, Apple, may be trying to and appease federal officials to create a repository of goodwill in hopes of mitigating the plethora of antitrust remedies that can be imposed,” Daniel A. Hanley of the Open Markets Institute told Recode. “History has shown that being aggressively adverse does not bode well.”

Indeed, Apple has recently been in the crosshairs of antitrust investigations from the Federal Trade Commission and the subject of lawsuits from app developers and consumers over its app store monopoly. Apple and other massive tech companies are currently the subject of a Justice Department probe into whether its market dominance has made it impossible for others to compete. Yet another class action lawsuit filed by app developers accuses Apple of creating a monopoly through its App Store, which is the only way iOS users can get apps on their devices and therefore the only way app developers can sell their product to them. Oh, and the US Supreme Court ruled last May that an antitrust lawsuit against the company could proceed. There, iPhone owners accused Apple of passing along the cost of the 30 percent commission it takes from App store purchases to consumers, inflating prices while — due to users’ inability to get apps any other way — also creating a monopoly.

While the recent iPhone lawsuit is different from the ebooks situation in many regards, it doesn’t look good that Apple is paying out a nine-figure settlement linked to deceiving customers. By the same token, it probably would have looked a lot worse — and cost Apple a lot more — had Apple gone to court and lost.

BuzzFeed News says it gained access to the leaked documents, and indeed, it looks like Clearview was working with everyone from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the NBA.

The new BuzzFeed report paints a chilling picture of Clearview’s scope and ambition to market its all-powerful facial recognition technology. Not only does the client list revealed in the leaked documents include references hundreds of local police departments as well as federal agencies like ICE, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, but it also shows that retail companies like Best Buy, Walmart, and Macy’s have conducted trials with Clearview. There are also international entities like Interpol and a research center in Saudi Arabia not to mention some private investigators in the mix.

All this information flies in the face of Clearview’s previous claims that it only worked with domestic law enforcement agencies. It also raises questions about Clearview’s plans to make a publicly available facial recognition app, which experts have described as dangerous. BuzzFeed News reports:

For a company that maintains its tools are for law enforcement, Clearview’s client list includes a startling number of private companies in industries like entertainment (Madison Square Garden and Eventbrite), gaming (Las Vegas Sands and Pechanga Resort Casino), sports (the National Basketball Association), fitness (Equinox), and even cryptocurrency (Coinbase). The logs also show that the startup is particularly interested in banking and finance, with 46 financial institutions trying the facial recognition tool.

There’s more:

Employees at big-box retailers, supermarkets, pharmacy chains, and department stores have also trialed Clearview. Company logs reviewed by BuzzFeed News include Walmart (nearly 300 searches), Best Buy (more than 200 searches), grocer Albertsons (more than 40 searches), and Rite Aid (about 35 searches). Kohl’s, which has run more than 2,000 searches across 11 different accounts, and Macy’s, a paying customer that has completed more than 6,000, are among the private companies with the most searches.

Several of the companies listed above have distanced themselves from Clearview. Others, like the NBA and Coinbase, admitted to conducting trials of the software.

“While we conducted a limited test as we do with an array of potential vendors, we are not and have never been a client of this company,” the NBA said in a statement to Recode.

“We are not Clearview AI clients,” Best Buy said in an email to Recode, “We don’t use Clearview AI and don’t plan on using it in the future.”

Meanwhile, privacy advocates are very concerned about the consequences of the Clearview’s technology as well as its security issues.

“This list, if confirmed, is a privacy, security, and civil liberties nightmare,” Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the ACLU, told Recode. “Government agents should not be running our faces against a shadily assembled database of billions of our photos in secret and with no safeguards against abuse.”

Following the breach, Gizmodo managed to get its hands on a version of Clearview’s Android app, which was stored on a publicly accessible Amazon server. While a login was needed to access Clearview’s facial recognition system, Gizmodo was able to see some code that indicated features under development including voice search, the ability to take photos in the app that could be matched to Clearview’s database, and the ability to scan drivers license barcodes. CEO Hoan Ton-That told Gizmodo that the latter feature “doesn’t scan drivers licenses,” despite the fact that the file is named “Barcode$DriverLicense.smali.”

Before these details emerged, the Daily Beast reported that an intruder gained “unauthorized access” to Clearview’s client list, its number of user accounts, and a number of searches its customers have conducted. That client list now appears to be particularly sensitive, especially since it contradicts Clearview’s earlier statements about working with a limited number of law enforcement agencies.

For now, there is no evidence that Clearview’s database of 3 billion photos was hacked. But the fact that the company could be breached at all is worrisome enough. Clearview says it obtained these photos by scraping publicly available images from all over the internet. The company’s software uses proprietary facial recognition technology to help law enforcement agencies identify suspects by matching their images with those in the database.

Clearview’s lawyer, Tor Ekeland, seemed blasé about the news in his response to Recode.

“Security is Clearview’s top priority,” he said. “Unfortunately, data breaches are part of life in the 21st century. Our servers were never accessed. We patched the flaw, and continue to work to strengthen our security.”

Sen. Edward J. Markey, who has been highly critical of the company, said in his own statement that Clearview’s comments would be “laughable” if its “failure to safeguard its information wasn’t so disturbing and threatening to the public’s privacy.”

“This is a company whose entire business model relies on collecting incredibly sensitive and personal information, and this breach is yet another sign that the potential benefits of Clearview’s technology do not outweigh the grave privacy risks it poses,” Markey said.

Though Clearview is playing the breach off as a minor and quickly solved problem, it brings up larger issues that have been bubbling under the surface since Clearview’s existence was made widely known last month in a New York Times report. Those include worries about what would happen should Clearview’s data fall into the wrong hands, and how much confidence we should really have in the cybersecurity practices of a private company we know little about and have no reason to trust.

If security is indeed Clearview’s top priority, this data breach doesn’t bode well. If the client list really does represent the number and type of companies and agencies with access to Clearview’s powerful technologies, this situation might be much more serious than previously thought.

Update, February 28, 2020, 1:40 pm ET: Updated to include new details from a Gizmodo report as well as statements from Best Buy, the NBA, and the ACLU.

"['Daniel Markus', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Feb']",2020-02-28,CRISPR’s co-developer on the revolutionary gene-editing technology’s past — and its future,"Jennifer Doudna will be the first to tell you that she didn’t invent CRISPR, but she did help start the CRISPR revolution. In 2012, she was part of a small group of researchers at the University of California Berkeley who showed that CRISPR technology can be used to edit the genetic code of just about any organism quickly and precisely.

CRISPR gets its name from DNA fragments found in many bacteria. When bacteria successfully fight off invaders like viruses, they chop up the outside genetic material and store it as CRISPR sequences, creating a “database” of invader genes. Whenever a potential threat arrives, the bacteria can send defense enzymes (called Cas proteins) to search for CRISPR sequences in the invader; if one is found, the enzymes chop up its genetic material, killing it.

Doudna and her team realized that by giving Cas proteins genetic material resembling that of an invading organism, the proteins will cut DNA in a targeted, scalpel-like fashion. In the hands of scientists, the tool has radically simplified gene editing, the process of altering the biological instruction manual of living organisms.

After just eight years since its discovery, gene editing with CRISPR is still a very experimental technique. But the results so far have been promising: Researchers have used CRISPR to treat muscular dystrophy and Alzheimer’s disease in mice, fight drug-resistant bacteria, and create tastier tomatoes.

But editing human DNA is where the use of CRISPR becomes more controversial.

We’re starting to see early and positive results from preliminary trials of sickle cell therapies in humans. But as much as CRISPR has produced promising medical advances, the power of this gene-editing tech has a darker side.

Just a few months ago, Chinese scientist He Jiankui received a three-year jail sentence after using CRISPR to edit the genes of human embryos, twin girls who were born in November 2018.

In this episode of Reset, host Arielle Duhaime-Ross talks with Jennifer Doudna about the promise and peril in CRISPR’s future, what’s next, and how we can edit our genes safely and responsibly.

The transcript of their conversation that appears below has been edited for length and clarity.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Let’s talk about using CRISPR in humans. Where do you stand on this? How should we think about using CRISPR on people?

Jennifer Doudna

It’s very important to appreciate that there are fundamentally two different ways that CRISPR can be used clinically. When we say clinically, we’re talking about using it in human patients.

One of those ways is to use CRISPR in embryos, and if we do that, then it creates changes to the DNA of embryos that become part of that individual.

The other way to use CRISPR clinically is to use it in individuals. That means changing DNA in the cells of an individual, not in a way that becomes heritable by future generations, but just in a way that affects that individual patient.

That’s something that from the very beginning I have been a proponent of, because of the potential to correct disease-causing mutations.

What I’ve been really vocal about avoiding is the former situation where you would use CRISPR to create heritable changes. I’ve called initially for moratoria on that and more recently for global regulation around that.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

So there are a few human clinical trials happening right now using CRISPR, and one in particular is a treatment for sickle cell anemia. To be clear, this treatment doesn’t make a change in people’s DNA that could be passed down to future generations. So when you hear that there are promising early results coming out of that trial, how do you feel?

Jennifer Doudna

Deeply moved, because I think for any of us working in science, the idea that our work could someday help someone with a health care situation that they and their families are facing, that’s really why we do our work. So I feel very excited about the potential of the technology.

Of course, I’m cautious. I want to make sure that it proceeds in a very appropriate, regulated fashion, and these trials that we’re seeing the early announcements for right now are going exactly down that path.

Assuming that those trials pan out, the big question will be how do we make sure that this technology is affordable and accessible to people that need it? That’s really the challenge that I’m now thinking more and more about and working on at the Innovative Genomics Institute.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

You were one of the first people to hear about what the Chinese scientist He Jiankui did. He created the world’s first babies genetically edited with CRISPR, those two twin girls. Can you tell me the story of hearing about that for the first time?

Jennifer Doudna

So this goes back to the fall of 2018. I had been organizing the second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, which was scheduled to take place in November of 2018 in Hong Kong. And right before that meeting started, I received an email that had the subject line “Babies Born.” It was from Dr. He Jiankui and it was a very short message explaining that he and his colleagues had done clinical work to introduce embryos whose DNA had been altered with CRISPR to create a pregnancy that resulted in the birth of twin girls with altered genomes in China. And immediately, of course, this raised many questions about both the science and the ethics of what had been done.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

So what happened next? You received this email and then what?

Jennifer Doudna

I flew out that night to Hong Kong so I would have a little bit of extra time before the meeting got started, and I ended up meeting with Dr. He before the meeting got started. He was already scheduled to be a speaker at that conference, and so when we met, we talked about what he was planning to present and also just trying to understand what had been done, first of all, and also why. What was his motivation? Why undertake something like this at this time?

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Were you satisfied with the answer?

Jennifer Doudna

Well, I guess what was really kind of surprising to me honestly at the time was that although it seemed very clear to me and our colleagues that the work that had been done was really inappropriate for a number of reasons and really unethical.

This was not something that had really seemed to have occurred to him. He seemed to see himself more as a pioneer, somebody who was the first to bring this to people that might want to use it that way.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

What would it take for you to feel comfortable about a clinical trial that would change a person’s DNA in a way that would allow that change to be passed on to that person’s offspring?

Jennifer Doudna

I think first and foremost, one would have to identify a real medical need for that and that real need is, right now, certainly, difficult to identify. But I think going forward, if there are real situations where an honest assessment says changing DNA is truly the best option for this family, for their children, etc., I think one would have to really want to have a whole pipeline of regulatory guidelines and a pathway for proceeding that would ensure safety of that kind of application. You would want to be able to follow their health outcomes over the course of their lifetime, especially in the early days of using the technology like that.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Do you often think about the potential ways that this technology down the line could end up being used? Do you often worry about things like eugenics?

Jennifer Doudna

I think that’s frankly right now still at the level of science fiction. It’s not something that’s going to happen anytime soon. That being said, I think it’s important that we right now grapple with the reality that we have in our hands a tool that in principle does enable that. It does allow control of genes and control of genes in families, and I think that it’s essential that we be tackling that issue right now, not running from it, but saying, look, this is a powerful tool. It has this potential and we need to already be thinking about how it could be used safely and how we appropriately regulate it.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Some people are very excitedly talking about CRISPR as a technology that could be used to prevent certain conditions, and I want to ask you about folks with disabilities. You sometimes hear people talk about “fixing deafness,” “fixing” conditions like dwarfism, and folks who are part of that community really get worried when they hear those things, because not everyone feels like they need to be fixed. They don’t feel broken. Where do you stand on that?

Jennifer Doudna

Your question really to me brings up broader considerations about … fundamentally, what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to embrace the diversity that we see across human cultures, human societies? To me, that’s one of the real joys of life.

So I think that to take it to an extreme, you could imagine a world where human beings have been sort of homogenized in a way, and we have a standard set of genes that we want people to inherit. Again, that’s really in the realm of science fiction.

But I think imagining that helps to put in perspective what we’re really talking about here, a situation where suppose that in the next decade or two, parents could go to an in vitro fertilization clinic and they could choose from a menu of genes.

Would this be a good thing or not? What if we could eliminate deafness, for example? Would that be a good thing or would it eliminate some of the richness from the world? It’s a hard question to answer, and I think it has to remain in the hands of individuals at some level.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

When you hear these people talk about things like eliminating deafness … do you have a position? Have you figured out how you feel about this truly?

Jennifer Doudna

I think it’s a very individual choice to me. If you’re asking me if I were a prospective parent and this was a decision that I needed to make about my child, what would I do? Boy, that’s a hard one.

I have a wonderful son, and I see all the quirks that he has and things that just make him a wonderful person, and I think there’s a joy to that.

At the same time, if you knew ahead of time somehow that I had a genetic disorder that I knew he would be inheriting in some way and I could prevent it, well, I think, of course, as a parent, I would have that desire to prevent it.

I think these are some of the really interesting and really challenging questions that are now in front of us given that we have a technology that in principle, at least … will provide some of that type of capability to people. It’s a really profound and really interesting question, but it’s hard to answer.

Arielle Duhaime-Ross

Do you think that we’re going slow enough with CRISPR?

Jennifer Doudna

Boy, how to answer that. I guess the first thing I would say is that, the technology is so enabling for scientists that there’s no way to put the genie back in the bottle, at least at the level of research. And then, of course, at a whole different level, there’s the very tangible opportunities to affect people in positive ways that suffer from genetic disease. That is very exciting.

So I guess in the end, I don’t think it’s moving too fast. But I do think it’s moving fast for sure, and that it really does make it imperative that the scientific community deal right up front with the various challenges that we face to make sure it’s used safely.",vox,https://www.vox.com/2020/2/28/21154930/jennifer-doudna-crispr-gene-editing-babies
"['Sigal Samuel', 'Feb']",2019-02-28,Kids’ brains may hold the secret to building better AI,"The mathematician and computer science pioneer Alan Turing hit on a promising direction for artificial intelligence research way back in 1950. “Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind,” he wrote, “why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s?”

Now AI researchers are finally putting Turing’s ideas into action. They’re realizing that by paying attention to how children process information, they can pick up valuable lessons about how to create machines that learn.

DARPA, the Defense Department’s advanced research agency, is embracing this approach. It recently invited proposals from interdisciplinary teams of computer scientists and developmental psychologists, which will work to create AI systems capable of learning the things babies learn in the first few years of life.

To the developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik, this approach is the obvious way to go. She explains why in an essay titled “AIs Versus Four-Year-Olds,” which appears in the anthology Possible Minds: 25 Ways of Looking at AI. Noting that preschoolers can learn things even the most sophisticated AIs can’t, Gopnik argues that studying kids can give programmers useful hints about directions for computer learning.

I was drawn to Gopnik’s essay not only because of the catchy title, but also because she and I both majored in philosophy at McGill University (three decades apart), and because her piece is one of only three in the book written by women. The fact that women represent 12 percent of contributions to the anthology mirrors the gender imbalance in the machine-learning community at large, where only 12 percent of the leading researchers are female, according to Wired.

Gender may go some way toward explaining why it’s taken computer scientists nearly 70 years to act on Turing’s ideas about the importance of children in AI research. Kids have traditionally been considered the domain of women.

I spoke to Gopnik about how her research on children has been perceived by male scientists and how that may finally be changing to the benefit of AI research. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows.

Sigal Samuel

There’s a lot of fearful talk out there about how AI poses a catastrophic risk to humanity. Do you think that fear is overblown?

Alison Gopnik

I think it’s wildly overblown. We have a lot more to fear from natural stupidity than from AI. Obviously if you have, say, an AI system governing your missile launches, that’s something that could have catastrophic consequences, and it’s very legitimate to be worried about that. But the fantasy that these systems are going to develop a general intelligence and then enslave us all — I think that’s absurd.

Sigal Samuel

Is that because you’ve gotten to see up close just how far our most sophisticated AIs are from the abilities of kids?

Alison Gopnik

Yeah, that’s right. When you give AIs a large data set, they can figure out the difference between cats and dogs. That’s very impressive. But they’re not good if you introduce a change, or if there’s data coming from a different source, or if you alter some high-order characteristic of the environment. They have what’s called “catastrophic forgetting” — they have to relearn what they’d already learned. But somehow kids can be facing a brand new task, something they’ve never seen before, and they can figure out what the right thing to do is.

So, for example, AlphaZero, amazingly, learned how to play chess. But if you change the rules — now the bishop can’t go diagonally, it can only go horizontally — AI systems have a really hard time learning that, because they’ve learned their information from all the times they’ve played the game before.

A human chess player, even a kid, will immediately understand how to transfer that new rule to their playing of the game. Flexibility and generalization are something that even human 1-year-olds can do but that the best machine learning systems have a much harder time with.

Sigal Samuel

Why are some of the problems that are easy for kids so hard for computers?

Alison Gopnik

It’s called Moravec’s paradox: The things we thought would be hard — like playing chess — are things machines can do very easily, yet they can’t do things a 4-year-old can do.

The puzzle for development psychology is we don’t really understand how it is that kids can easily do what they do. We know they can make these wide-ranging inferences from very small amounts of data. They’ve got a lot of [innate] knowledge through evolution. But how can they make good inferences about things that weren’t part of our evolutionary ancestry? Look at a 4-year-old with a smartphone. They can manage it better than you can! This system hasn’t been out in the world before, yet kids are very good at mastering it. We don’t have a clue how that’s possible.

Sigal Samuel

So given that we know very little about how kids learn the stuff they learn, what hints do you think AI researchers can pick up from paying attention to kids’ learning?

Alison Gopnik

One difference that could be very relevant is that the AI only exists inside a computer. The kids are out in the real world. We know they spend a lot of time doing experiments and getting data that’s relevant to the problems they’re trying to solve. They’re curious. They’re running to get that smartphone, poking it and swiping it and figuring out how it works. Same thing with a pile of blocks or a plug.

Psychologists call that active learning. That ability to go out into the world and experiment, rather than just taking the data someone’s presented to you — that’s something that’s very distinct about how children learn.

People in AI are totally becoming cognizant of that now. My colleagues and I are collaborating with people in Berkeley to see if they can design an AI that’s curious. Not just picking up things from the data it’s fed but going out to find information based on something that doesn’t fit with what it already knows.

Sigal Samuel

Another difference you highlight between kids and AIs is that kids are social learners, right? They don’t learn in isolation — they learn from other kids in their preschools and from adults.

Alison Gopnik

Right, children are always learning from other people. And it’s not like they’re mindlessly imitating those around them. They’re using theory of mind when deciding whether and how to learn from other people — they’re understanding what’s going on in other people’s minds. Is this person trying to teach me [to perform a certain action,] or are they doing it accidentally?

The machines aren’t even in the same ballpark as being able to understand basic theory of mind, let alone using those inferences to shape whether they would learn from someone else or not.

Sigal Samuel

Kids also don’t just passively obey their teachers or parents; they bend and break the rules. That’s part of creativity.

Alison Gopnik

Creativity is something we’re not even in the ballpark of explaining. My example is Augie, my grandson. When he was 4, he was talking to his grandfather, who said, “I really wish I could be a kid again.” Augie thought about it and said, “Don’t eat any broccoli or green beans. Then you can be a kid again!” He was thinking: Everyone tells me that if I eat healthy food I’ll grow to be a big, strong adult, so maybe if you do the opposite, you can be a kid again.

That’s something an adult would never think of, but it’s not just crazy or random. That ability to generate ideas that are genuinely different from what you’ve been taught before but are not totally random, that’s real creativity, and we don’t have a clue how to understand that. Even the simple “kids say the darnedest things” variety — we don’t understand it.

Sigal Samuel

I think the creativity issue is really core to people’s difficulty grappling with AI. Many of us want to believe there’s more to the human mind than “just” computation. There’s emotion, there’s the ability to express emotion through art. … People have a resistance to the idea that we’ll be able to build a machine that can do that.

Alison Gopnik

We already know there’s a machine that can do that. We’re it! We are this system of relays and neurons that produces creativity and all the rest of it. So we have an existence proof that there is such a machine.

The best way we have for explaining how it’s possible for a machine to do all this is to say it’s a machine that does computation. If that big bet is right, we’ll be able to figure out how things work.

Maybe computation will turn out to be wrong. Maybe the panpsychist argument about consciousness [that it’s a universal feature of all things in the natural world] will turn out to be right. That seems less likely — we have no evidence for it — but I don’t think it’s impossible. I just don’t think it’s necessary to believe there’s something other than computation. It’s an incredibly productive way of thinking about how a biological system can do what we do. And I don’t think its productivity is anywhere near being used up.

Sigal Samuel

I really appreciate the observation that we already make machines that think — we make children, and they’re biological machines and they have consciousness and they have creativity! And given that, it doesn’t seem inconceivable to me that we’ll one day create our children’s mechanical analogues. But I don’t think this way of framing it — AI as just another sort of child, or the child as a biological machine — has really soaked into the public consciousness yet. Why is that?

Alison Gopnik

I’ll be political for a second and say, when I talk about my research to scientists, people still come up to me and say, “You should talk to my wife, she’s a preschool teacher.” I mean, yeah, I probably should, because preschool teachers do fascinating and important work. But it reflects an intellectual pecking order — anything to do with kids is soft, it’s women’s work, it’s at the opposite end of the pecking order from computation.

Do you know that in the 1967 Encyclopedia of Philosophy, children just don’t even show up at all? You’d think humans had produced asexual cloning or something! That way of thinking is still very much out there in the world.

Sigal Samuel

I know what you mean. When I was studying philosophy at McGill — this was a decade ago — there were not a lot of female students in the department, and the few who were there didn’t speak up in class half as much as the guys. I always felt like it had an impact on what kinds of topics were even considered part of philosophy.

Alison Gopnik

I’m 63, so I was in philosophy at McGill in the 1970s, and this has kind of been my dilemma my entire career. I remember thinking to myself, you could go do computation theory or philosophy of mind. But you could solve the same problems by thinking about kids, and that’d be a way of saying: These kids who have not been taken seriously — let’s treat them with the same intellectual seriousness. I very self-consciously decided to take that route that has completely been part of what women do, and to show that it’s as intellectually profound as what the guys have done.

Sigal Samuel

Do you feel like you’ve succeeded?

Alison Gopnik

Well, the guys are still telling me to talk to their wives. They’re still treating developmental psychology as if it’s something suitable for an education department. But I do think it’s really changed a lot. The fact that there are more women in computer science and philosophy is making a big difference. There’s no question that people in computer science are excited about this now and are recognizing that children are really important.

It’s appealing to think that 4-year-olds, who are the lowest on the totem pole, the most philosophically neglected, might turn out to actually be the secret to solving problems that these very high-status geeky male computer scientists can’t solve. I think there’s a nice moral inversion there.

"['Rani Molla', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Feb']",2020-02-28,What the Ring hacks tell us about tech’s backward approach to security,"If you build it they will come — but they won’t necessarily set up two-factor authentication.

The software and devices that are increasingly integral to our daily lives are constantly compromising our privacy and security. But when these issues arise, regular people often get the blame.

That’s because hacks and other online invasions are almost always avoidable. Users are lectured that they should have chosen long, unique passwords and that they should have subscribed to a password manager; that they should have set up two-factor authentication; that they should never use public wifi. In other words, they got burned because they didn’t do what they were told.

It shouldn’t be this way.

“The problem with all of these kinds of solutions is they put the onus of security responsibility on the user,” Marc Rogers, VP of cybersecurity at access management company Okta, told Recode. “And the user is the least equipped person to do anything about that. They don’t understand the risks well, and they don’t want the complexity.”

Take Amazon Ring, a video security device consumers are increasingly using to give themselves a sense of security and peace of mind in their homes. Ironically, these devices have left people feeling less secure, after a spate of high-profile hacks in late 2019 made it possible for strangers to commandeer Ring cameras to surveil and harass people in their own homes. In one instance, a strange man talked to and terrified an 8-year-old girl in her own bedroom, where her parents had placed a Ring security camera as a communication and security measure.

“Security should be seen but not heard. It should be something that’s simple. It shouldn’t get in the way.”

In response, Ring said it hadn’t done anything wrong and blamed the hacks on customers. It said the hacked customers had made their devices vulnerable by reusing old, compromised passwords. Some of these users have disputed that claim, but either way, the point is clear: The tech company faulted its customers, rather than acknowledging its own role in the situation.

Months after news of these hacks went public, Ring has introduced a number of standard security measures for users, like default two-factor authentication — a feature that requires users provide a second piece of info, like a code from their phone, before they can get access to an account — and a dashboard through which they can monitor who else might be accessing their video feeds. Ring had stopped short of mandating two-factor for existing users, saying that doing so could cause mass logouts, but after sustained pressure, including an article I published last year calling for this change, Ring finally made two-factor a requirement for all users last week.

But the fact remains that they sold insecure devices with inadequate safety protocols to an untold number of consumers first.

Tech companies tend to put the onus of security on users in part because they are trying to get as many people as possible to use their devices, and they see any extra security measures as something that creates friction that might turn off those users. It’s also not a coincidence that good security practices, like any other extra layer of oversight, cost these companies more time and money to develop.

“At Ring, our top priority is the safety and security of our customers. We understand that Ring users put their trust in our products, and we strive to maintain that trust so our customers can feel confident that their homes and personal information are safe with Ring,” Ring said in a statement to Recode. “We reinforced that commitment with the addition of mandatory two-step verification for all users, and we will continue to add additional features related to user privacy and account security while maintaining the convenience and ease-of-use our customers have come to expect.”

Security and ease of use are often positioned as being diametrically opposed, with one coming at the expense of the other. They don’t have to be. Reconciling them will require a lot of effort, and no tech company will get everything right. There will also be some trade-offs between ease of use and security. But none of that should prevent tech companies from aiming for a reasonable balance and meeting basic standards.

“We have to convince all the big companies that it is not the user’s responsibility to make their stuff secure,” Rogers said. “Security should be seen but not heard. It should be something that’s simple. It shouldn’t get in the way. But it should be there when it’s needed, shouldn’t force the users to do complicated things or memorize huge strings of numbers that they’re just going to write down.”

“I don’t think you have to completely trade off one for another,” Jen King, director of consumer privacy at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, told Recode. “And I think that people who are still making that argument are kind of in a mindset of 10-plus years ago.”

Rather, she says, it’s a design issue.

“There is a lot of work that’s been done in this area, both in the academic field, followed by corporate leaders in this space like Apple, to really try to understand human limitations and how we design products to minimize or anticipate those limitations so that people don’t have to work as hard,” King said. Instituting these best practices requires investments in people who do user experience research, which considers “how people think, [and] what their priorities and incentives are” in order to develop products and features that will ensure their security.

It also requires looking at how others have solved these issues.

“Certainly, there’s no excuse not to look around at your competition and see what other people are doing,” King said.

What hardware and software companies need to do to make us all more secure

Ultimately, it’s every tech company’s responsibility to make sure their products are secure in a way that’s accessible to regular users.

Apple’s Face ID and Touch ID, which allow you to unlock your iPhone with tech that either recognizes your face or your fingerprint, are a move in the right direction. The process is faster and often easier than entering in a passcode, all while ensuring security.

“When Touch ID came out, I think it was something like less than one in five people even had a PIN code on their iPhone. And the reason why is they found it inconvenient,” Rogers said. “Apple brought out Touch ID. And that went up to like 80 or 90 percent of people had security on their phone. It wasn’t because they suddenly woke up and decided they needed security, it was because security suddenly met their lifestyle — it became convenient.”

Other companies have other creative security solutions. Google offers a version of two-factor authentication wherein an alert will simply pop up on your phone if it’s in range of another device that’s asking permission, which is much easier than retrieving a text code or going to an authenticator app for a code. The different methods for two-factor authentication vary in their relative security — dynamically generated codes in an app have historically been more secure than sending a code via text, for example — but are all better than no two-factor at all.

At the very least, big tech companies should institute some basic best practices.

These include suggesting or requiring more difficult passwords, as well as shipping devices with their own unique password attached. Device and software makers should make sure their default settings — which are what most people end up using — are the most secure options they have, rather than an option for only people who are privacy savvy. They should also mandate two-factor authentication, although that can be trickier for the less tech-savvy among us. In fact, they should take that as a challenge and explore inventing an easier alternative. Rogers suggests that using biometrics — like a thumbprint or face scan — to prove who you are can be both secure and easy to use.

This isn’t to say keeping up with security challenges is easy.

The security issues companies have to contend with are getting more difficult as hackers become more savvy and as we desire our apps and devices to become more connected with one another. We like the convenience of effortlessly sharing a photo from our phones to a social network; we expect to seamlessly upload our contact lists to new accounts. We just want to be in control of the process.

“In the old days, if you wanted to compromise a phone, you would have to break into the phone,” Rogers said. “Now, the application you target has all these permissions. And every permission that an app has is something that can be exploited,” he said.

To combat these added difficulties, he suggests looking for software and device makers that engage in a concept called “zero trust,” a model that assumes you can’t trust anyone, even people within your own company. It continually verifies that an app or device or person connecting to your account actually should have access. More and more companies are testing this model, including Google, the pharmaceutical company Allergan, and Okta, though it’s far from mainstream.

“We should automatically assume that any connection that we see coming from the internet into a phone or from an app to another app or an app to data could be untrustworthy, and then take every step we can do to dynamically assess it, and treat it as untrusted until we can prove that it is trusted,” Rogers said. “We start off protecting things from that kind of model and then you’re going to have a much more strong system.”

While there have been numerous government attempts to create regulation around basic digital security practices, none have gotten off the ground. The Federal Trade Commission can fine companies for egregious data breaches and issue reports, creating a rough idea of guidelines, but these efforts fall short of actually being able to legislate that companies meet those standards. So for now, in the absence of regulation requiring security and privacy best practices, consumers are reliant on tech companies to take the initiative to act in our best interests — but as we’ve seen so far, they tend to hurl blame at us first.

"['Shirin Ghaffary Rani Molla', 'Shirin Ghaffary', 'Rani Molla', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Feb']",2020-02-20,"Apple, Facebook, and Google stocks are falling after surge in coronavirus cases","The outbreak of the Covid-19 coronavirus disease has taken the lives of more than 2,770 people — with a vast majority of those deaths in China plus a growing number in countries like South Korea, Iran, and Italy — and infected more than 80,000 as of February 26. As the world scrambles to contain the public health crisis, global businesses are starting to take a hit, particularly in the technology sector.

China — which is the second-largest economy in the world — has all but halted its production of consumer goods such as phones, clothing, and automobiles for the past several weeks. The country has taken on unprecedented “wartime” measures to control the virus’s spread, such as placing severe restrictions on some 780 million people and instituting mass quarantines in major cities.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the lockdown on Chinese manufacturing has caused global markets to “shudder” and is casting an “ever-widening shadow” on the economy at large. That’s particularly relevant in the tech industry, which depends on Chinese labor to build everything from computer chips to cellphone parts. In recent days, China has started reopening its factories (despite public health concerns) in an effort to restart its economy, but manufacturing sites are running at a far lower capacity than usual.

It’s still too early to measure the full financial impact of the virus on the tech industry, but the early signs don’t look good. Technology shares, which had been steadily increasing this year — even during the beginning of the global outbreak — recently took a dive, although they have recovered slightly nearing Wednesday’s NYSE closing. The S&P 500 information technology sector, which analysts use to measure total shares in the tech industry, had fallen by over 9.3 percent from last Thursday’s close compared to a drop of 7.3 percent across sectors, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

Stock markets fluctuate all the time based on a variety of factors, and the coronavirus is impacting stocks across industries, not just tech. But the tech sector’s recent plunge is especially concerning given its recent track record of being resistant to any significant hits, and the fact that the top five major tech companies — Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google parent Alphabet — account for a large portion of the total stock market.

Apple — the world’s most valuable tech company — said it is reducing its revenue targets this quarter in a rare company advisory released on Monday. Tesla said last week that “health epidemics” are a risk to its business. Amazon, whose e-commerce business relies on the flow of goods between China, the US, and other countries, has not released any similar warnings but is stockpiling supplier items from China to protect against future disruptions due to the virus. And Chinese companies themselves are feeling the hit, with tech giant Alibaba calling the outbreak a “black swan” event (as in, unpredictable) on a recent earnings call.

Social media companies — which are trying to keep up with a slew of misinformation about the virus’s origins and spread — are still financially less impacted than companies like Apple since their main line of business isn’t selling physical goods. But even Facebook has been affected, setting reduced production goals for its Oculus Quest virtual reality headsets in part due to a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing because of the virus.

And virtually all the major tech companies — Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft — have restricted employee travel to China, either banning or limiting it only to matters of critical importance. They’re also asking workers returning from China to work from home for up to two weeks.

In some cases, tech professionals in the US are so concerned about the virus that they’re taking other precautions, such as wearing breathing masks and eliminating handshakes in business meetings, as Recode previously reported. For now, there are only four confirmed cases in the San Francisco Bay Area, but some feel these preventative measures are important given the high volume of travel between China and Silicon Valley — and concerns that the virus could quickly grow out of control given how it has spread in Asia.

Overall, the economic and social impact the coronavirus is having on the tech industry puts into stark relief the close connection between Silicon Valley and China, not just for manufacturing but for supplying a workforce of highly skilled engineers, investor funds, and academic collaboration.

Outside the workplace, tech companies are pulling out of major global conferences or canceling them altogether. As Recode reported last week, Facebook canceled a 5,000-person global marketing conference in San Francisco. And the world’s largest phone trade show, Mobile World Congress, was canceled after major tech companies like Amazon pulled out over coronavirus concerns.

Here are more specifics on some of the main ways we are seeing coronavirus impact the global economy, particularly in the tech industry.

Supply chain disruption

Virtually every major US tech company that builds physical products — like cellphones, computers, or video game consoles — relies on a vast Chinese workforce to manufacture products for cheaper than could be done in the US.

In the past few weeks, though, that supply chain, which includes everything from raw parts to finished products, has been fundamentally disrupted.

Factories in China have been shut down. Hundreds of millions of migrant workers who were visiting family in cities outside the main manufacturing hubs for Chinese New Year were quarantined. Some are beginning to return to work, but reports indicate that as of earlier this week, over two-thirds remain stuck. Roads have been blocked, trains halted, and flights canceled.

In its advisory, Apple said Monday that “worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained” because its manufacturing sites in China are “experiencing a slower return to normal conditions” than anticipated as manufacturing sites in the region reopen.

The New York Times reports that even though some factories are starting up again, they are still “operating well below capacity.” And there are serious public health concerns about whether reopening the factories is the right decision at all, considering the virus continues to spread in China and elsewhere.

Companies are increasingly talking about the threat of the virus in public business announcements. A MarketWatch report found that out of the S&P 500 companies’ recent earnings calls between January 1 and February 13, 38 percent of transcripts included the term “coronavirus” at least once.

Another major tech company with its supply chain impacted by the virus is Amazon. It’s estimated that more than 40 percent of Amazon sellers are based in China, which means that a large chunk of the products people buy comes from the country. In addition to that, a large portion of US-based sellers source their products from China.

According to a recent Business Insider report, Amazon reached out last week to a number of suppliers for products sold in the US but made in China and encouraged them “to stockpile on certain products shipped from China, in anticipation of potential supply chain slowdowns caused by the coronavirus outbreak in the region,” according to the outlet.

In response to a question about this practice, Amazon sent Recode the following statement: “Out of an abundance of caution, we are working with suppliers to secure additional inventory to ensure we maintain our selection for customers.”

Facebook also said the manufacturing of its Oculus Quest headsets is impacted by the outbreak.

“Oculus Quest has been selling out in some regions due to high demand,” Facebook spokesperson Anthony Harrison wrote in a statement to Recode. “That said, like other companies, we’re expecting some additional impact to our hardware production due to the coronavirus. We’re taking precautions to ensure the safety of our employees, manufacturing partners and customers, and are monitoring the situation closely. We are working to restore availability as soon as possible.”

Chinese demand

Another way the coronavirus outbreak is impacting business is by reducing Chinese consumers’ demand for consumer electronics.

China is the United States’ third-largest and fastest-growing market for exports, which means that US companies are increasingly setting revenue goals that rely on Chinese residents buying their products.

Apple in particular made a whopping $52 billion in sales in the last fiscal year by selling its products (mostly iPhones) in the country. With the recent easing of tensions in the US-China trade war, analysts were anticipating that number to grow at a faster rate than it had in previous months.

But now, because of the coronavirus, that could all change. Apple temporarily closed some of its more than 40 stores in the country and is currently still operating some under limited hours.

The company said on an earnings call that there has been “very low customer traffic” in its stores.

What we can expect

Some business analysts are hoping this will be only a temporary disruption that will slow down in the coming weeks — but so far, the virus has proven to be difficult to contain and hard to predict.

The last health crisis to impact trade between China and the rest of the world was SARS in 2003. But at that time, the country wasn’t as important a player in the global economy as it is today.

The extent to which US-based tech companies are being impacted by the coronavirus demonstrates how reliant the tech industry is on China.",vox,https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/20/21145803/coronavirus-impacting-big-tech-business-apple-amazon-facebook-big-tech-impacted
"['Sara Morrison', 'Alex Ward', 'Zeeshan Aleem', 'Nathan Nichols', 'Feb']",2020-02-12,Apple’s malware problem is getting worse,"Think your Apple product is safe from malware? That only people using Windows machines have to take precautions? According to cybersecurity software company Malwarebytes’ latest State of Malware report, it’s time to think again. The amount of malware on Macs is outpacing PCs for the first time ever, and your complacency could be your worst enemy.

“People need to understand that they’re not safe just because they’re using a Mac,” Thomas Reed, Malwarebytes’ director of Mac and mobile and contributor to the report, told Recode.

Windows machines still dominate the market share and tend to have more security vulnerabilities, which has for years made them the bigger and easier target for hackers. But as Apple’s computers have grown in popularity, hackers appear to be focusing more of their attention on the versions of macOS that power them. Malwarebytes said there was a 400 percent increase in threats on Mac devices from 2018 to 2019, and found an average of 11 threats per Mac devices, which about twice the 5.8 average on Windows.

“There is a rising tide of Mac threats hitting a population that still believes that ‘Macs don’t get viruses,’” Reed said. “I still frequently encounter people who firmly believe this, and who believe that using any kind of security software is not necessary, or even harmful. This makes macOS a fertile ground for the influx of new threats, whereas it’s common knowledge that Windows PCs need security software.”

Now, this isn’t quite as bad as it may appear. First of all, as Malwarebytes notes, the increase in threats could be attributable to an increase in Mac devices running its software. That makes the per-device statistic a better barometer. In 2018, there were 4.8 threats per Mac device, which means the per-device number has more than doubled. That’s not great, but it’s not as bad as that 400 percent increase.

Also, the report says, the types of threats differ between operating systems. While Windows devices were more prone to “traditional” malware, the top 10 Mac threats were adware and what are known as “potentially unwanted programs.”

Adware typically redirects users to websites with ads on them or throws pop-up ads in front of their intended internet destination. Those may not be as “dangerous,” as the report says. They are becoming a “noticeable nuisance,” and some of them are able to track your activity, making them a privacy issue as well.

Potentially unwanted programs are apps that are often downloaded along with software you actually want or come pre-installed on your device. The most frequently detected of these came in the form of “system optimizers” that, ironically enough, often pitch themselves to Mac users as adware removers (for a price).

Even though Google is a relative newcomer in the operating system business, it has its own set of problems. Malwarebytes found malware pre-installed on some phones running its Android operating system as well as third-party apps that came infected with adware. This is a known issue with Android phones, although as we’ve pointed out before, the security of these devices isn’t always entirely in Google’s control, since Android is an open source platform.

As for Apple’s iOS platform, which is used in its mobile devices, the new Malwarebytes report noted that there is currently “no way” to scan for malware but that it is known to exist — mostly in targeted attacks by nation-states, which is not something the average user has to worry about.

What can you do about malware if you’re a Mac user? A few things.

“People need to understand that they’re not safe just because they’re using a Mac,” Reed said. “They need to exercise care about what they click on, what apps they download — and from where — and who they allow to have access to their computers.”

A big factor in the Mac malware increase might be down to one piece of adware called NewTab. As 9to5 Mac pointed out, there were almost 30 million downloads of the NewTab adware app on Mac devices in 2019 alone. This is typically downloaded onto devices by posing as an app or browser extension that will track package deliveries or flights. Reed also recommended against installing Adobe Flash Player. “Fake Flash installers are one of the top methods for getting malware installed on a Mac,” he said.

In general, if you’ve downloaded malware, you can try removing it manually or, if you’re less comfortable messing around with your computer’s settings, get a security program that will do it for you.

As always, practice good password hygiene, as one machine was infected because the hacker gained remote access by using a password that was exposed in a password breach. That’s one of many reasons to use different passwords for your accounts and change them on a regular basis.

Of course, downloading anti-virus software never hurts. Malwarebytes will sell you some of that, as will many other companies. Just make sure the one you choose is a trusted source. And always be wary of free software — it’s never really free.

"['Lois Parshley', 'Feb']",2020-02-05,Our phones can now detect health problems from Parkinson’s to depression. Is that a good thing?,"It’s all too easy in these chaotic times to understand how someone with a stressful job might start feeling isolated at work, wrestle with anxiety, and develop insomnia. That’s how Katie, a young lawyer, found herself increasingly disconnected, spending her weekends in bed.

“She was just trying to get through the day,” says Caroline Ogilvy, a clinical independent social worker who met Katie when she came into her primary care office, an affiliate of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, to get help with her depression. (Because of medical personal privacy laws, “Katie” is a pseudonym.) At the time, Ogilvy was recruiting patients for research the hospital was conducting with Companion MX, an app that uses data collected from cellphones to monitor patients’ mental health, and Katie’s symptoms made her eligible to participate.

Patients like Katie who used Companion MX had their location, screen time, and outgoing calls and texts tracked via their smartphones, in addition to filing mood logs through the app, which are analyzed using voice analysis. The app turned all this data into scores for mood, interest, social connections, and energy — categories that can be used to coach patients toward behavior changes.

Deducing details of a person’s health through how often they text or when they leave home is called digital phenotyping, and it’s a rapidly growing area of research. Phenotypes, generally speaking, are the traits, like behavior and appearance, derived from how your genes interact with your environment. Today, these environmental interactions happen not just in the physical world, but online, too.

Some researchers are now even using the term as a catch-all for the data people leave behind on the internet, social media, and other technology. The smartphones, Fitbits, sleep trackers, and other connected devices that constantly surround us generate an incredible amount of rich social and behavioral data. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, a network scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has helped pioneer the study of using cellphone data for medical purposes, explains that something as simple as a text message can reveal a lot about someone’s health. “It’s like a micro-cognitive assessment. You have to have executive function, memory, linguistic function — it’s these little things that turn out to be incredibly informative about a person’s state.”

In the future, Onnela explains, digital phenotyping could help doctors diagnose mental illnesses — such as depression and anxiety — as well as a wide variety of others, including Parkinson’s disease. Scientists have analyzed how people use their phones to predict Parkinson’s disease with 100 percent accuracy. Technology may also provide new ways of monitoring and treating the disease: Another study found that accelerometer data from cellphones and smartwatches, which measure how your devices move through space, can estimate the severity of Parkinson’s tremors, helping patients understand their disease progression.

Many of these tools may soon be able to predict illnesses before they would otherwise be diagnosed. Take the language used in Facebook posts, which scientists believe can predict conditions as disparate as diabetes and depression. (Some of the links can seem bizarre: One study published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE found that people who used words such as “God” or “pray” in their posts were 15 times more likely to have diabetes — which may just mean language reveals geographic and economic differences, which have huge impacts on health.) Other researchers have run studies demonstrating how smartphones’ speakers and microphones can be used to detect with great accuracy important changes in breathing that occur before opioid overdose deaths — which might enable your phone to alert emergency services, even if you were unconscious.

But as digital phenotyping’s predictive ability and use broadens, it raises critical questions about whether it could consolidate information and power in the hands of those who already have it, and keep it from those who don’t.

Medical innovations are notoriously slow. It took more than 200 years for the thermometer to catch on. Even today, the average lag time between research discovery and adoption is 17 years.

But the public is hungry for information that was once the exclusive domain of doctors — demonstrated first by WebMD or Drugs.com, and then in a ballooning number of startups that hoped to help consumers more easily access their own health data, like ill-fated Theranos, which falsely claimed it could provide test results from tiny amounts of blood. More recent efforts include K, an app that lets you input symptoms and then uses artificial intelligence to give you a potential diagnosis, and the dystopian Hu-manity.co, which helps people sell their patient data directly to pharmaceutical companies, declaring: “Everyone has the right to legal ownership of their inherent human data as property.”

These innovations come at a time when public health crises may require rapid adaptation. In the 20 years that Companion MX’s co-founder, Carl Marci, has been a psychiatrist, rates of depression have risen dramatically. More than 13 percent of Americans age 18 to 25 have experienced major depressive episodes in the past year; suicides have also spiked in older adults, with rates in men between ages 45 and 64 alone rising 45 percent since 2000. Or take opioids: Since 1999, more than 400,000 Americans have died from opioid overdoses, about six times the number that died in the Vietnam War.

In the midst of these health crises, Companion MX is using machine learning — computer programs that can learn patterns from datasets — to analyze voice recordings. This includes measuring factors that reveal “not what you say, but how you say it,” Marci explains, such as how fast someone’s talking, variations in their tone, and other signs of vocal stress in order to screen for depression.

Traditionally, doctors like Marci have had to rely on patients self-reporting their mental health symptoms during office visits. A new wave of apps, however, can monitor patients in real-time. For example, the startup Spire Health focuses on physical biomarkers such as pulse and activity rates, with a wearable it claims can forecast stress. Others, such as Mindstrong, a new Palo Alto-based company, tracks your cellphone and connects you with a therapist via text when it thinks you need it.

Ogilvy, for example, used Companion MX’s passive tracking of Katie’s phone to help her find ways of managing her depression. The independent record of her habits helped Katie realize the extent to which she’d been withdrawing on the weekends. Using the app, Ogilvy coached her on sleeping and eating patterns, helping her reintroduce regular exercise. “She was able to feel more in control,” Ogilvy says.

Ogilvy says this kind of personalized, data-driven health care is “the wave of the future.” But as digital phenotyping moves from proof-of-concept studies and clinical research to Silicon Valley startups, there are still big questions about its potential effects. At a time when people are growing cautious of how their personal information is used, Marci acknowledges, “Trust has been eroded. We have a challenge to convince people that we take security seriously.”

As new companies increasingly target sensitive medical information, it has raised ethical considerations about who owns and profits from health care data, and what regulations should be expanded to protect privacy and ensure equal access to treatment. There’s a larger philosophical question, too: Is it crazy to be constantly quantifying one’s well-being via a device that may be making us less healthy in the first place?

“It’s wonderful for research, but it’s just such a Wild West out there,” says Mona Sobhani, director of research at the University of Southern California Center for Body Computing, and a cognitive neuroscientist who studies technology trends like digital phenotyping. Sobhani talks about our digital footprints as if they were bread crumbs — the data sprinkled through everyday online interactions are by themselves meaningless, she says, “but in aggregate, you’re looking for relationships.”

“Everything in our lives [is] so tightly linked — our mental and physical health, our environment,” Sobhani says. “What worries me is making sure the right people have the data and are using it in a non-harmful way.”

What’s not at question is the general dissatisfaction with America’s health care. “The biggest secret of medicine is how poorly we understand people’s behaviors,” Onnela says. He explains that although technology has revolutionized certain areas of medicine, such as surgery, it’s still hard to study behavioral and social traits outside of the lab. “So we’re trying to bring the technology — the ability to measure — to where people actually live and experience their lives.”

That process is made easier by the fact that most Americans now rely on technology capable of monitoring them in uncountable ways. Transistors were invented to control electrical signals in 1947; smartphones and computers would be impossible without them. Until recently, the number of transistors that can fit on a chip has doubled approximately every two years, enabling smaller, cheaper digital sensors — and the era of big data. These changes are now so seamlessly woven into daily life that it’s hard to believe the iPhone is only 12 years old. Eighty-one percent of American adults now own a smartphone; as of 2014, there were more mobile phone subscriptions than people on the planet. For medical researchers, the ability to track behavior at this global scale, in natural, everyday environments, is unprecedented. For consumers, it’s also led to a revolution in understanding — or at least quantifying — our own behavior; apps that monitor everything from steps to sleep to period cycles have become incredibly popular.

Digital phenotyping can be broken into three general categories. Some researchers and companies are working on the ability to screen and diagnose patients. As of 2017, for example, Facebook has been analyzing posts to assess suicide risk, alerting law enforcement to those it deems at risk of imminent harm. Others are working on symptom monitoring; a recent study tracking schizophrenia patients’ cellphones found that their mobility patterns and social behavior changed before relapses. But the most crowded space is focused on interventions, like turning therapy into an app you can access from your phone. “Uniting all of those things is that we don’t really have an objective way of measuring mental health,” says Kit Huckvale, a research fellow in health informatics at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, who has extensively studied digital phenotyping.

Digital phenotyping might provide a new way to make that kind of measurement. For instance, Tom Insel, co-founder of Mindstrong and former director of the National Institute of Mental Health, and California’s “mental health czar,” explains that it’s possible for a computer to analyze how someone is feeling just from their quality of voice or their word choice. “It’s really important for people to understand that acquiring the data is the easy part,” Insel says. The challenge is to analyze the data in meaningful ways, parsing what is meaningful, and not “over-fitting,” or predicting connections between behaviors and illnesses where there are none.

The implications may be far-reaching — for example, helping providers understand when patients leave a doctor’s office still confused. Take, for instance, a study by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and two other institutions, which got permission from participants to combine their search histories with their medical records. One patient, after being told they had a “walnut-sized fibrous tumor,” went home and searched “How big is a walnut?’ and “What is a fibrous tumor?” Overall, the study found that health-related searches doubled the week before patients visited an emergency department.

These new tools, Onnela says, “deployed at a population level” have the potential to combine precision medicine — the trend of tailoring treatment to an individual, considering their genetics and lifestyle — with public health. Onnela is one of the researchers working on the new Apple Women’s Health Study, announced in November 2019. It will track participants’ period cycles and conduct monthly surveys in order to understand the impact of women’s behaviors and habits on reproductive health. Onnela says it has the potential to become the largest and longest-running study on women’s health. “The scale is unprecedented.” (Apple is a partner with Vox Media on The Highlight.)

But other than emphasizing that participants give informed consent, Onnela said he was legally unable to share further details about the study’s design or goals. This kind of insistent secrecy is not unusual for Apple or the tech world, but it’s a larger problem with digital phenotyping: As health care applications emerge, health data will move from clinical settings to for-profit companies, and the systems that collect and distribute this data aren’t always — or even often — transparent about how it’s being used.

Consider Google’s recent interest in health care: Last fall, Google acquired activity- and sleep-tracking device manufacturer Fitbit in a $2.1 billion deal. Google also secretly launched a partnership with Ascension, a nonprofit health system, to store and analyze 50 million Americans’ medical records without their knowledge or consent. “As a data scientist,” says Sobhani, “that is a beautiful data set.” Even just knowing your ZIP code allows predictions of your life expectancy. “But all of the information from all of your behaviors from your Google account, with your medical record, tied to your Fitbit? Oh my God, I could predict so many things.” A whistleblower told the Guardian that the data is not being anonymized and is being transferred with personal details like names, medical history, lab results, and diagnoses.

Though Google insists that it will only use the data to “support improvements in clinical quality and patient safety,” what it will learn from the analysis has huge value. While your Fitbit might indicate behaviors that suggest a risk of cardiovascular disease, for machine learning to work, it has to know if you actually end up with a diagnosis. Thanks to Ascension, Google can now train its AI to comb through the data and find these connections.

Google has already expressed interest in being able to infer medical conditions; in 2018, the company filed a patent for a smart device that makes inferences based on what it sees in your home, sorting users into categories. It’s not a stretch to imagine that health insurers could someday raise your premiums based on your cooking habits or how much you drink. If you don’t want to share such private information, your decision may result in higher insurance rates — as Fitbit, which has sold more than 100 million devices, has already proved in lucrative deals with insurance companies. That’s one reason why Sobhani calls tech companies’ move into health “alarming.”

“These wearables are collecting health data, make no mistake, and they’re under no obligation from HIPAA or anything else to protect it,” she says. Generally, in the US, there are few regulations protecting consumers’ data. Federal laws such as HIPAA are much more restricted than commonly believed — they currently only apply to health care companies and systems. HIPAA also allows health care companies to share patient data with third parties, as long as the data is being used to help “carry out its health care functions,” as Google’s Ascension deal does. Nor is it just Google; Facebook is rolling out a new Preventive Health tool this month that will give users personalized reminders about health care and local places to get a screening or a flu shot. (Facebook says the data will not be shared or sold to third parties.)

“There are a number of gray areas” in what should be considered health data, says Nicole Martinez-Martin, a professor of biomedical ethics at Stanford University. It’s not just data itself that needs protecting, but also what can be gleaned from it. “What kind of inferences can be made from the data that goes beyond what was in that record itself?”

This isn’t a hypothetical future concern; 23andMe has just sold its users’ DNA data to a pharmaceutical company, which plans to use it for drug discovery. Spurred by the rise of genomic testing, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have drafted a “Protecting Personal Health Data Act.” But even if it passes, the bill has an exception for data “derived solely from other information that is not personal health data” — a gaping loophole, as data collected from phones or internet searches is not yet considered health data. Meanwhile, there are plenty of incentives for companies to pursue health data. The digital health care market is expected to reach $206 billion by next year.

Corporations already have access to all kinds of mundane online data, including browsing data and search terms that can provide sensitive health information. Ginni Manning, a playwright in the UK who tried unsuccessfully for seven years to have a child, experienced how this data can be used. “When [a pregnancy] starts to go wrong, you’re desperate for someone, somewhere, to say it’s fine,” she says, recalling her long strings of heart-broken symptom searches. “And of course, it’s not.” It was a haunting, horrible time, made worse by the fact that when she logged into Facebook, all of the ads had to do with babies and getting pregnant. Many of her friends lived abroad, and she needed their support, she explains, so she remained on the social networking site. After each miscarriage, Manning tried going into the ad choices and blocking pregnancy-related terms, but it didn’t seem to make a difference. Manning says she wishes there were guidelines about how online ads are targeted, or ways to opt out.

Currently, there aren’t. It’s common knowledge Google and Facebook use your internet history to sort you into ad brackets. (Facebook also tracks your movements, even if you turn off location permissions.) But more than 70 percent of smartphone apps also sell your data — which can be used not only to create a profile of your buying and spending habits, but also to expose things like whose house you spent the night at or what doctor’s office you’re visiting, revealing personal details of your behavior thousands of times a day — sometimes even when they explicitly say they don’t. British journalist Talia Shadwell found that after she forgot to enter a period in a period-tracking app, ads for baby clothes and prenatal vitamins started haunting her around the internet, “a bit like an overbearing relative,” she wrote in the Daily Mail. When Shadwell checked the app privacy settings, she found it promised not to share details “entered manually,” but the language “cleverly avoided ruling out sharing information about aggregated data.”

Given what we now know data analysis can reveal, all online data can be considered health data. Say you’re one of the 72 percent of adults who use the internet to research health concerns. Tim Libert, a computer scientist at the CyLab Security and Privacy Institute at Carnegie Mellon University who investigates privacy, explains that if you click on a web page — for instance, the Centers for Disease Control’s page on HIV — third-party requests are sent to at least four servers, including Google Analytics. These companies can correlate your visit to the HIV page with other activity from your IP address, correlations that can reveal your identity — and that you’re specifically interested in HIV. This isn’t a one-off example. Libert has written a program that tracks cookies, the code embedded in a browser that allows companies to follow individuals around the internet. In 2015, he analyzed 80,000 pages relating to common diseases and found that more than 91 percent tattled, contacting third parties in the US.

While this kind of tracking may be useful to medical researchers, Martinez-Martin, the Stanford biomedical ethics professor, says the risks extend far beyond commercialization. Insurance companies could base rates on your data, reacting to conditions that you might not even be aware of. Or, she asks, “Could educational institutions access some of this behavioral health information in deciding things like admission?” Employers already place job ads targeted to certain online profiles; it’s not a stretch to imagine them being able to filter potential candidates based on what apps you use and what that tells them about your maternity status. If you start excluding people from being able to even see certain opportunities, Martinez-Martin asks, “Are there repercussions for people that they may not be aware of because their data is out there?”

Luke Stark, a researcher at Microsoft studying the social, emotional, and ethical aspects of digital technologies, warns that “prognostic scores and algorithms can exert their own effects on care” — meaning what your phone might learn about you can essentially become self-fulling prophecies. (Stark notes his views don’t reflect the company’s.) A study out of the University of Michigan’s Stroke Program found that an incorrect calculation of stroke patients’ chances changed their odds of survival, as well as what kind of care they received. If someone is alerted that they might be at higher risk of suicide by a tracking app, for example, Martinez-Martin says, “There’s not enough research about what the psychological ramifications might be.”

Sobhani believes sensitivity will be required in the future. “If we don’t know what this data is going to tell us, what it’s going to suggest about future behaviors or health — it’s not fair to be labeled with it.”

The next phases of digital phenotyping will likely be even more sweeping, pulling from even more sources of data. “It would be very useful, especially in central nervous system disorders, to couple digital phenotyping data with genomic data,” says Onnela. “That seems like a very obvious thing to do.” This potentially means your genetic risk for disease could be compiled with your daily activities and environmental interactions into one database — which would be an incredibly powerful research tool, but one that also raises questions. Stark, for his part, thinks that technology will also be increasingly trained to understand how we’re feeling from both verbal and facial cues. But, he adds, “The more these very thorny problems are embedded in the way these technologies work, the more they’re going to start impacting ordinary people.”

“To see what’s in front of one’s nose,” George Orwell wrote, “is a struggle.” A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that a majority of Americans report being concerned about the way their data is being used by companies. The same study found that 75 percent — with broad bipartisan support — think there should be more government regulation of how consumer digital data is used.

Researchers aren’t blind to these concerns. Onnela has taken steps to increase privacy in his studies, like adding noise to try to anonymize data, and using open-source code for additional transparency. Much of the clinical research on digital phenotyping has, in fact, taken privacy extremely seriously. But as this research starts to inform commercial products, a lack of regulations and the push for profit pose lots of questions for the future of digital phenotyping.

“Every technology has value, starting from the hammer,” Onnela says. “There are always going to be bad actors out there. The one thing we can all do is educate ourselves about the capabilities of the technology — but also about its inherent limitations.”
