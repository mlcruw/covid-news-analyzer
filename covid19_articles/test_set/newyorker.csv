"['Charles Duhigg', 'Charles Duhig', 'Isaac Chotine', 'Jeannie Suk Gerse']",2020-05-04,Seattle’s Leaders Let Scientists Take the Lead. New York’s Did Not,"The first diagnosis of the coronavirus in the United States occurred in mid-January, in a Seattle suburb not far from the hospital where Dr. Francis Riedo, an infectious-disease specialist, works. When he heard the patient’s details—a thirty-five-year-old man had walked into an urgent-care clinic with a cough and a slight fever, and told doctors that he’d just returned from Wuhan, China—Riedo said to himself, “It’s begun.”

For more than a week, Riedo had been e-mailing with a group of colleagues who included Seattle’s top doctor for public health and Washington State’s senior health officer, as well as hundreds of epidemiologists from around the country; many of them, like Riedo, had trained at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, in a program known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service. Alumni of the E.I.S. are considered America’s shock troops in combatting disease outbreaks. The program has more than three thousand graduates, and many now work in state and local governments across the country. “It’s kind of like a secret society, but for saving people,” Riedo told me. “If you have a question, or need to understand the local politics somewhere, or need a hand during an outbreak—if you reach out to the E.I.S. network, they’ll drop everything to help.”

Riedo is the medical director for infectious disease at EvergreenHealth, a hospital in Kirkland, just east of Seattle. Upon learning of the first domestic diagnosis, he told his staff—from emergency-room nurses to receptionists—that, from then on, everything they said was just as important as what they did. One of the E.I.S.’s core principles is that a pandemic is a communications emergency as much as a medical crisis. Members of the public entering the hospital, Riedo told his staff, must be asked if they had travelled out of the country; if someone had respiratory trouble, staff needed to collect as much information as possible about the patient’s recent interactions with other people, including where they had taken place. You never know, Riedo explained, which chance encounter will shape a catastrophe. There are so many terrifying possibilities in a pandemic; information brings relief.

A national shortage of diagnostic kits for the new coronavirus meant that only people who had recently visited China were eligible for testing. Even as EvergreenHealth’s beds began filling with cases of flulike symptoms—including a patient from Life Care, a nursing home two miles away—the hospital’s doctors were unable to test them for the new disease, because none of the sufferers had been to China or been in contact with anyone who had. For nearly a month, as the hospital’s patients complained of aches, fevers, and breathing problems—and exhibited symptoms associated with COVID-19, such as “glassy” patches in X-rays of their lungs—none of them were evaluated for the disease. Riedo wanted to start warning people that evidence of an outbreak was growing, but he had only suspicions, not facts.

At the end of February, the C.D.C. began allowing the testing of patients with unexplained respiratory-tract infections or “fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness.” Riedo called a friend—an E.I.S. alum at the local department of health. If he sent her swabs from two patients who had needed ventilators but had tested negative for influenza and other common respiratory diseases, would she test them for COVID-19? At that point, there had been only sixteen detections of the coronavirus in the U.S., and only the one in Washington State. “I can’t remember why we picked those two patients,” Riedo told me. “I was sure they’d be negative. But we thought it would be good to start collecting data, and it was a way to make sure the testing lab was working.” The health official told him to send the samples to her lab.

Riedo remembered that other local researchers had been conducting a project called the Seattle Flu Study. For months, they had collected nasal swabs from volunteers, to better understand how influenza spread through the community. During the previous few weeks, the researchers, in quiet violation of C.D.C. guidance, had jury-rigged a coronavirus test in their lab and had started using it on their samples. They had just found a positive hit: a high-school student in a suburb twenty-eight miles from Seattle, with no recent history of foreign travel and no known interactions with anyone from China. The boy wasn’t seriously ill; if the researchers hadn’t done the test, the infection probably never would have been detected. The genetic sequence of the boy’s virus was unnervingly similar to that of the man with the first known case, even though the researchers couldn’t find any connections between them. The frightening implication was that the coronavirus was already so widespread that contagion was passing invisibly among community members.

At seven-forty that evening, Riedo got a call from his friend at the public-health lab. Both of the samples he had sent were positive. Riedo sent over swabs from nine other EvergreenHealth patients. Eight were positive. Riedo grabbed the patients’ charts and saw that seven of them had come from the Life Care nursing home. It didn’t make any sense: nursing-home residents don’t travel, and interact mainly with just family members and staff.

Riedo sent in more samples. Most of the patients tested positive, including a woman who had been told that she had pneumonia, another woman who had complained of sweating and clammy hands, and a man in his fifties with serious respiratory problems. For three days, dozens of that man’s family members had sat at his bedside in the hospital, coming in and out of the building and going from home to work, visiting restaurants and shaking people’s hands, inadvertently exposing themselves and others to COVID-19.

At that moment, there were no known U.S. coronavirus fatalities. Schools, restaurants, and workplaces were open. Stock markets were near all-time highs. But when Riedo stopped to calculate how many of his hospital employees had been exposed to the coronavirus he had to quit when his list surpassed two hundred people. “If we sent all of those workers home for two weeks, which is what the C.D.C. was recommending, we’d have to shut down the entire hospital,” he told me. He felt like a man who, having casually swatted at a buzzing insect, suddenly realized that he was beneath a beehive.

The next day, the man with all the family visitors died. It was America’s first known COVID-19 death. Riedo called his wife. “I told her I didn’t know when I would be coming home,” he said to me. “And then I started e-mailing everyone I knew to say we were past containment. It had already escaped.”

Epidemiology is a science of possibilities and persuasion, not of certainties or hard proof. “Being approximately right most of the time is better than being precisely right occasionally,” the Scottish epidemiologist John Cowden wrote, in 2010. “You can only be sure when to act in retrospect.” Epidemiologists must persuade people to upend their lives—to forgo travel and socializing, to submit themselves to blood draws and immunization shots—even when there’s scant evidence that they’re directly at risk.

Epidemiologists also must learn how to maintain their persuasiveness even as their advice shifts. The recommendations that public-health professionals make at the beginning of an emergency—there’s no need to wear masks; children can’t become seriously ill—often change as hypotheses are disproved, new experiments occur, and a virus mutates. The C.D.C.’s Field Epidemiology Manual, which devotes an entire chapter to communication during a health emergency, indicates that there should be a lead spokesperson whom the public gets to know—familiarity breeds trust. The spokesperson should have a “Single Overriding Health Communication Objective, or SOHCO (pronounced sock-O),” which should be repeated at the beginning and the end of any communication with the public. After the opening SOHCO, the spokesperson should “acknowledge concerns and express understanding of how those affected by the illnesses or injuries are probably feeling.” Such a gesture of empathy establishes common ground with scared and dubious citizens—who, because of their mistrust, can be at the highest risk for transmission. The spokesperson should make special efforts to explain both what is known and what is unknown. Transparency is essential, the field manual says, and officials must “not over-reassure or overpromise.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/seattles-leaders-let-scientists-take-the-lead-new-yorks-did-not
"['David Remnick', 'David Remnic', 'Isaac Chotine']",2020-04-20,The Preëxisting Condition in the Oval Office,"Illustration by João Fazenda

When has New York known a grimmer week? The sirens are unceasing. Funeral parlors are overwhelmed. Refrigerator trailers are now in service as morgues, and can be found parked outside hospitals all over town. We’re told that there are “glimmers of hope,” that hospital admissions are slowing, that the curve is flattening. Yet the misery is far from over. “The bad news isn’t just bad,” New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said at one of his briefings last week. “The bad news is actually terrible.”

Across the country, the coronavirus continues to ravage the confined and the vulnerable, from inmates of the Cook County jail, in Chicago, to workers at the Tyson Foods poultry plant in Camilla, Georgia. Data from a variety of reliable sources show that African-Americans, who suffer disproportionately from poverty, inadequate housing, limited access to good health care, and chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension, are dying from COVID-19 at horrific rates.

The pandemic is an event in the natural history of our species, but it is also a political episode. Its trajectory is shaped by policy measures specific to particular governments. The fact that the United States is experiencing tremendous losses—that it has far more COVID-19 cases than any other country in the world—relates to a number of collective risk factors and preëxisting conditions. The most notable one is to be found in the Oval Office.

“This is not the apocalypse,” President Barack Obama assured his shell-shocked staff members the morning after Donald Trump’s election. When, the next day, Obama received Trump at the White House and tried to relay information about a range of issues—the threat from North Korea, the Iran nuclear deal, immigration, health care—he got nowhere. Trump wanted to talk about himself and the size of his campaign rallies. Obama spoke about the value of having at his side such people as his homeland-security adviser, Lisa Monaco, citing her insistence on bringing him unvarnished, unwelcome news about everything from terrorism to the Ebola crisis. In the White House, she was known as Dr. Doom. Trump replied that maybe he should hire a Dr. Doom; he was joking. From the beginning, he practiced social distancing from anyone who told him what he didn’t want to hear.

And here we are, playing a tragic game of catch-up against a virus that has killed thousands and left millions unemployed. At Trump’s State of the Union address on February 4th, he pledged, “My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.” Three weeks later, Kayleigh McEnany, a loud promoter of birtherism and of Trump talking points during the 2016 campaign, cheerfully told the Fox Business audience, “We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here, we will not see terrorism come here, and isn’t that refreshing when contrasting it with the awful Presidency of President Obama?” Now McEnany is the President’s press secretary.

The coronavirus has inflicted a level of pain that is deep and global. And yet many nations, from South Korea to Germany, have done far better at responding to it than the United States has. The reasons for the American failing include a lack of preparation, delayed mobilization, insufficient testing, and a reluctance to halt travel. The Administration, from its start, has waged war on science and expertise and on what Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon called “the administrative state.” The results are all around us. Trump has made sure that a great nation is peculiarly vulnerable to a foreseeable public-health calamity.

If the death rate turns out to be less than the initial forecasts––and, please, let it be so––it will be thanks to the discipline of the public and the heroics of first responders, not the foresight or the leadership of the President. The knowledge that we are led so ineptly and with such brazen self-regard is humiliating to millions of American citizens, if not to their leader. Trump gives himself “a ten” for his performance and berates any reporter who dares to challenge that premise. “You should say, ‘Congratulations! Great job!’ ” he told one, “instead of being so horrid in the way you ask the question!”

A nation facing a common threat normally pulls together, but Trump’s reflex is always to divide; he has invoked a multiplying litany of enemies. He directs his fire at the Obama Administration, at the World Health Organization, and at governors from Albany to Sacramento, with their constant pleas for ventilators, test kits, and face masks. The Democrats are to blame for everything. Early in the year, as the pandemic grew, they “diverted” the attention of the federal government, because “every day was all about impeachment,” as Trump’s unfailing loyalist Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, put it.

At a time of medical peril and economic devastation, the President heads to the White House briefing room and frames the terms of his reëlection campaign. It is a campaign of cynicism and authoritarian impulses. To begin with, he has made it clear that he does not approve of efforts to make voting easier in November. Why should he? He takes a dim view of early voting, voting by mail, and same-day registration. Such reforms, he complains, would produce “levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”

Trump has not had the sort of bounce in the polls usually seen by Presidents during a crisis, but this hardly insures an end to his reign. Senator Bernie Sanders, who did so much to transform the debate over health care, the environment, and education policy, in both the 2016 and 2020 campaigns, has dropped out of the race, and the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, has been either absent or woefully inarticulate in recent weeks. The former Vice-President cannot run on the idea of personal decency alone. He needs to provide a vivid, comprehensive plan of renewal equal to the moment. He needs to emphasize hard truths, one being that the laws of science, of the physical world, must be recognized. This pandemic is, in a sense, a rehearsal for what awaits us if we continue to ignore the demands of climate change. Biden would signal a seriousness of intent and offer a convincing alternative if he were to name very soon not only a Vice-Presidential running mate but a set of advisers and Cabinet officers who have shown themselves capable of policy rigor, executive competence, and compassion for the very communities that are suffering most from neglect and mistreatment.

Meanwhile, at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, a painful reckoning begins. New York has long prided itself on being a sort of cultural and political city-state, able to hold its own against any vagaries emanating from the White House. This is plainly not the case. We are in this together: that is the phrase, the balm, of the moment. But it is more than a cliché. It should be the spirit and the foundation of our national politics, starting with the election in November. ♦

"['Carolyn Kormann', 'Carolyn Korman', 'Eliza Griswol', 'Isaac Chotine', 'Siddhartha Mukherje']",2020-03-27,"From Bats to Human Lungs, the Evolution of a Coronavirus","For thousands of years, a parasite with no name lived happily among horseshoe bats in southern China. The bats had evolved to the point that they did not notice; they went about their nightly flights unbothered. One day, the parasite—an ancestor of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2—had an opportunity to expand its realm. Perhaps it was a pangolin, the scaly anteater, an endangered species that is a victim of incessant wildlife trafficking and sold, often secretly, in live-animal markets throughout Southeast Asia and China. Or not. The genetic pathway remains unclear. But to survive in a new species, whatever it was, the virus had to mutate dramatically. It might even have taken a segment of a different coronavirus strain that already inhabited its new host, and morphed into a hybrid—a better, stronger version of itself, a pathogenic Everyman capable of thriving in diverse species. More recently, the coronavirus found a new species: ours. Perhaps a weary traveller rubbed his eyes, or scratched his nose, or was anxiously, unconsciously, biting his fingernails. One tiny, invisible blob of virus. One human face. And here we are, battling a global pandemic.

The world’s confirmed cases (those with a positive lab test for COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) doubled in seven days, from nearly two hundred and thirteen thousand, on March 19th, to four hundred and sixty-seven thousand, on March 26th. Nearly twenty-one thousand people have died. The United States now has more confirmed cases than any country on earth, with more than eighty thousand on March 26th. These numbers are a fraction of the real, unknown total in this country and around the world, and the numbers will keep going up. Scientists behind a new study, published earlier this month in the journal Science, have found that for every confirmed case there are likely five to ten more people in the community with an undetected infection. This will likely remain the case. “The testing is not near adequate,” one of the study’s authors, Jeffrey Shaman, an environmental-health sciences professor at Columbia University, said. Comments from emergency-room doctors have been circulating on social media like S.O.S. flares. One, from Daniele Macchini, a doctor in Bergamo, north of Milan, described the situation as a “tsunami that has overwhelmed us.”

Scientists first discovered that coronaviruses originate among bats following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Jonathan Epstein, an epidemiologist at the EcoHealth Alliance in New York who studies zoonotic viruses—those that can jump from animals to people—was part of a research team that went hunting for the source in China’s Guangdong Province, where simultaneous SARS outbreaks had occurred, suggesting multiple spillovers from animals to people. At first, health officials believed palm civets, a mongoose-like species commonly eaten in parts of China, were responsible, as they were widely sold at markets connected to the SARS outbreak, and tested positive for the virus. But civets bred elsewhere in Guangdong had no antibodies for the virus, indicating that the market animals were only an intermediary, highly infectious host. Epstein and others suspected that bats, which are ubiquitous in the area’s rural, agricultural hills, and were, at the time, also sold from cages at Guangdong’s wet markets, might be the coronavirus’s natural reservoir.

The researchers travelled through the countryside, setting up field labs inside limestone caverns and taking swabs from dozens of bats through the night. After months of investigation, Epstein’s team discovered four species of horseshoe bats that carried coronaviruses similar to SARS, one of which carried a coronavirus that was, genetically, a more than ninety per cent match. “They were found in all of the locations where SARS clusters were happening,” he said.

After years of further bat surveillance, researchers eventually found the direct coronavirus antecedent to SARS, as well as hundreds of other coronaviruses circulating among some of the fourteen hundred bats species that live on six continents. Coronaviruses, and other virus families, it turns out, have been co-evolving with bats for the entire span of human civilization, and possibly much longer. As the coronavirus family grows, different strains simultaneously co-infect individual bats, turning their little bodies into virus blenders, creating new strains of every sort, some more powerful than others. This process happens without making bats sick—a phenomenon that scientists have linked to bats’ singular ability, among mammals, to fly. The feat takes a severe toll, such that their immune systems have evolved a better way to repair cell damage and to fight off viruses without provoking further inflammation. But when these viruses leap into a new species—whether a pangolin or a civet or a human—the result can be severe, sometimes deadly, sickness.

In 2013, Epstein’s main collaborator in China, Shi Zheng-Li, sequenced a coronavirus found in bats, which, in January, she discovered shares ninety-six per cent of its genome with SARS-CoV-2. The two viruses have a common ancestor that dates back thirty to fifty years, but the absence of a perfect match suggests that further mutation took place in other bat colonies, and then in an intermediate host. When forty-one severe cases of pneumonia were first announced in Wuhan, in December, many of them were connected to a wet market with a notorious wildlife section. Animals are stacked in cages—rabbits on top of civets on top of ferret-badgers. “That’s just a gravitational exchange of fecal matter and viruses,” Epstein said. Chinese authorities reported that they tested animals at the market—all of which came back negative—but they have not specified which animals they tested, information that is crucial for Epstein’s detective work. Authorities later found the virus in samples taken from the market’s tables and gutters. But, because not all of the first patients were tied to the market, nor were they connected to one another, Epstein said, “it raised the question of, well, perhaps those forty-one weren’t the first cases.”

Analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicate a single spillover event, meaning the virus jumped only once from an animal to a person, which makes it likely that the virus was circulating among people before December. Unless more information about the animals at the Wuhan market is released, the transmission chain may never be clear. There are, however, numerous possibilities. A bat hunter or a wildlife trafficker might have brought the virus to the market. Pangolins happen to carry a coronavirus, which they might have picked up from bats years ago, and which is, in one crucial part of its genome, virtually identical to SARS-CoV-2. But no one has yet found evidence that pangolins were at the Wuhan market, or even that venders there trafficked pangolins. “We’ve created circumstances in our world somehow that allows for these viruses, which would otherwise not be known to cause any problems, to get into human populations,” Mark Denison, the director of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Institute for Infection, Immunology, and Inflammation, told me. “And this one happened to say, ‘I really like it here.’ ”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/from-bats-to-human-lungs-the-evolution-of-a-coronavirus
"['Bill Mckibben', 'Bill Mckibbe']",2020-04-16,How We Can Build a Hardier World After the Coronavirus,"The coronavirus pandemic has revealed one particularly shocking thing about our societies and economies: they have been operating on a very thin margin. The edifice seems so shiny and substantial, a world of silver jets stitching together cities of towering skyscrapers, a globe of soaring markets and smartphone connectivity. But a couple of months into this disease and it’s all tottering, the jets grounded and the cities silent and the markets reeling. One industry after another is heading for bankruptcy, and no one knows if they will come back. In other words, however shiny it may have seemed, it wasn’t very sturdy. Some people—the President, for instance—think that we can just put it all back like it was before, with a “big bang,” once the “invisible enemy” is gone. But any prosperity built on what was evidently a shaky foundation is going to seem Potemkinish going forward; we don’t want always to feel as if we’re just weeks away from some kind of chaos.

So if we’re thinking about building civilization back in a hardier and more resilient form, we’ll have to learn what a more stable footing might look like. I think that we can take an important lesson from the doctors dealing with the coronavirus, and that’s related to comorbidity, or underlying conditions. It turns out, not surprisingly, that if you’ve got diabetes or hypertension, or have a suppressed immune system, you’re far more likely to be felled by COVID-19.

Societies, too, come with underlying conditions, and the two that haunt our planet right now are inequality and ecological turmoil. They’ve both spiked in the past few decades, with baleful results that normally stay just below the surface, felt but not fully recognized. But as soon as something else goes wrong—a new microbe launches a pandemic, say—they become starkly evident. Inequality, in this instance, means that people have to keep working, even if they’re not well, because they lack health insurance and live day to day, paycheck to paycheck, and hence they can spread disease. Ecological instability, especially the ever-climbing mercury, means that even as governors try to cope with the pandemic they must worry, too, about the prospect of another spring with massive flooding across the Midwest, or how they’ll cope if wildfire season gets out of control. Last month, the U.S. Forest Service announced that, owing to the pandemic, it is suspending controlled burns, for instance, “one of the most effective tools for increasing California’s resiliency to fire.” God forbid that we get another big crisis or two while this one is still preoccupying us—but simple math means that it’s almost inevitable.

And, of course, all these things interact with one another: inequality means that some people must live near sources of air pollution that most of us wouldn’t tolerate, which in turn means that their lungs are weakened, which in turn means they can’t fight off the coronavirus. (It also means that some of the same people can lack access to good food, and are more likely to be diabetic.) And, if there’s a massive wildfire, smoke fills the air for weeks, weakening everybody’s lungs, but especially those at the bottom of the ladder. When there’s a hurricane and people need to flee, the stress and the trauma can compromise immune systems. Simply living at the sharp end of an unequal and racist society can do the same thing. And so on, in an unyielding spiral of increasing danger.

Since we must rebuild our economies, we need to try to engineer out as much ecological havoc and inequality as we can—as much danger as we can. That won’t be easy, but there are clear and obvious steps that would help—there are ways to structure the increased use of renewable energy that will confront inequality at the same time. Much will be written about such plans in the months to come, but at the level of deepest principle here’s what’s key, I think: from a society that has prized growth above all and been willing to play fast and loose with justice and ecology, we need to start emphasizing sturdiness, hardiness, resiliency. (And a big part of that is fairness.) The resulting world won’t be quite as shiny, but, somehow, shininess seems less important now.

Passing the Mic

Mary Annaïse Heglar is one of the freshest and most important voices in the climate movement. She’s the writer-in-residence at Columbia University’s Earth Institute in partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Her personal essays—most of which revolve around themes of climate justice—are some of the most engaging writing I know on a subject that often inspires earnestness; a recent favorite was in Wired magazine. This interview has been condensed for clarity.

You say, “The facts have been on our side for a very long time, but we’re still losing.” Why?

The science on climate change has been crystal clear for literally decades. As Amy Westervelt has illustrated beautifully, on her podcast “Drilled,” the fossil-fuel companies knew that before anyone else. James Hansen testified before Congress thirty-two years ago. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the precursor to the Paris Agreement) dates back to 1992. We didn’t wind up in a climate crisis for lack of information, or even for lack of clearly communicated information. What was done was not done out of ignorance—it was done out of malice and greed. If all we had to do was have the right facts, we’d have been done a long time ago.

People feel as if they can’t take part in the fight because they’re not scientifically inclined. What do you tell them?

What I tell them is, “Girl, me, neither!” But you don’t need a scientific background or inclination to be part of the climate movement or conversation. This is not about science; it’s about justice. The science proves the severity of the injustice, sure, but it’s not the entire story. There’s a place for everyone in the climate movement because everyone, even the smallest toddler, understands the concept of “no fair.”

Everyone always asks me, “What should I be doing as an individual?” But is that even the right way to frame the question?

I get that question all the time, too, and it’s really frustrating. As I argue in my article, if you’re ready to graduate beyond the things that everyone should be doing—like cutting your carbon footprint, and voting for the climate, and showing up to demonstrations—then you’ve reached the point where you’re ready to become a bona-fide climate person. That means you’re past the one-size-fits-all activism. It’s time for your activism to mold to you, and only you can do that. No one told Greta [Thunberg] to strike, no one told Jamie and Nadia [the teen-age climate activists Jamie Margolin and Nadia Nazar] to help start Zero Hour. They just did it. No one told me to write—in fact, plenty of people told me not to! There’s so much to be done on climate, and so much that the people already involved with it haven’t thought of. There’s so much room for new ideas and new voices, so if you’re a new or aspiring climate person, you’re right on time. The better question would be “What can I do next?” An even better question would be “How did you find your niche in climate?” And then take those answers and carve out your own niche.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/how-we-can-build-a-hardier-world-after-the-coronavirus
"['Susan B. Glasser', 'Susan B. Glasse']",2020-05-01,History According to Trump: The President and the 1917 Pandemic That Wasn’t,"As the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted his Presidency, Donald Trump has often complained about the terrible hand that history has dealt him. This “deadly scourge” that crept up on him and disrupted a golden age of prosperity for America is “something the world has not seen for a long, long time,” as Trump put it on Monday, in one of his by now familiar riffs. “You could probably go back to 1917, where it was a terrible period of time,” he added. “You all know what happened in 1917.” On Tuesday, he returned once again to the theme of his once-in-a-century bad luck. “Even if you go back into 1917,” Trump said at a White House event for small-business leaders, “that was the worst of all time, but it was also not as bad as here. It was very bad, it was very rough. It was a bad one, but it wasn’t quite like what we’re going through right now.”

Except, of course, that the very bad, very rough, worst-of-all-time influenza outbreak was not a pandemic in 1917. The flu that killed more than six hundred and fifty thousand Americans was detected in the U.S. in the spring of 1918 and had killed an estimated fifty million people worldwide by 1920. Trump’s mistake is one of those small, seemingly inconsequential errors that anyone, and especially our fact-challenged President, might make. But Trump, it turns out, has referred to a 1917 flu dozens of times since mid-March, almost always when complaining about his own misfortune in leading the country through such a historically rare event. “Nobody has trained for this, nobody has seen this, I would say, since 1917, which was the greatest of them all, the greatest of this type of battle. Probably the greatest of them all, right? 1917,” Trump said, on April 4th. This week’s comments were no slip of the tongue.

When I checked Factbase, a Web site that catalogues Trump’s public statements, I found that he had made at least twenty-seven references to a 1917 flu pandemic since March 11th, and that did not count the offhand reference he made late Thursday afternoon while once again talking with reporters. A search of the White House Web site found that Trump mentioned 1917 on twenty-three days since mid-March. In a handful of instances—six, by my count—Trump referred to both 1917 and 1918, suggesting that someone had perhaps tried to give him the correct date, but he could never quite get it to stick. The story of a 1917 flu pandemic may well go down as a Trump classic, a pointless and unnecessary screwup that is also very telling about the President.

There’s another reason Trump’s repeated references to a nonexistent epidemic of 1917 seem so discordant: Trump’s own grandfather died of the flu, in 1918, likely from the first wave of the outbreak. Returning home from a walk in New York City one day that May, Friedrich Trump told his son that he felt ill, according to the historian Gwenda Blair. Soon after, he was dead. His grandson grew up to be the President of the United States during a time of global pandemic. He does not publicly mention how his grandfather died. “Another politician might well seize on his grandfather’s death during the 1918-19 pandemic as a point of empathy with those who have lost family and friends to COVID-19, but empathy is not in Trump’s playbook,” Blair, who interviewed Trump’s father about Friedrich Trump’s death but could not get the future President to speak about it for her 2000 history of the family, told me. “In the pandemic, as in everything else, his M.O. is about victory, vanquishing and demolishing perceived enemies and threats, from immigrants to the media to the coronavirus, not about identifying with loss and grief.”

Donald Trump, of course, is famously historically illiterate, a Republican President who has marvelled publicly that Abraham Lincoln, the Party’s patron saint, was a member of the G.O.P. At a Black History Month event, he spoke of Frederick Douglass, the nineteenth-century abolitionist leader, as if he were still alive and “being recognized more and more.” In “A Very Stable Genius,” the recent book about Trump by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of the Washington Post, there is an anecdote about the President visiting the U.S.S. Arizona memorial, in Hawaii, with John Kelly, his then chief of staff. Trump appeared to know almost nothing about the sneak attack that prompted the U.S. entrance into the Second World War. “Hey, John, what’s this all about?” the book quoted Trump as saying. “What’s this a tour of?”

The President’s ignorance about history, however, is often at odds with his desire to portray himself as a world-historical figure of vast importance. Just months into his Administration, he called his Presidency the most successful and accomplished of any since America’s founding. “There’s never been a President who’s passed more legislation,” Trump said five months after taking office, exempting only F.D.R. amid the Depression, “who’s done more things than what we’ve done.” At the time, Trump had passed and signed thirty-nine laws, all of them relatively minor.

The coronavirus pandemic has only accentuated Trump’s tendency to portray himself as a figure of sweeping historical significance, no matter how distorted that history is. “We built the greatest economy in the history of the world,” Trump said the other day, “and nobody even disputes that,” though it is not only disputed but quite obviously untrue. Trump is well aware that his entire Presidency now rides on the outcome of the pandemic and how he is perceived to have handled it. Already, Trump and his advisers are beginning to rewrite the history of the virus in a way that ignores the delay and denialism that led the U.S. to suffer the worst outbreak in the world so far.

On Wednesday morning, there was a “Fox & Friends” appearance for the ages by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has played a key behind-the-scenes role in the White House’s coronavirus response. “We’re on the other side of the medical aspect of this,” Kushner said, an astounding statement considering that, within the previous twenty-four hours, the United States had just hit more than a million confirmed infections and, in a space of weeks, surpassed the American death toll for the entire Vietnam War. “The federal government rose to the challenge, and this is a great success story,” Kushner added. Trump also took that view in an appearance later on Wednesday, saying, “We did the right thing. We did an incredible job.” This weekend, according to Politico, the Trump campaign intends to begin a seven-figure national television-ad blitz “touting Trump’s performance managing the coronavirus crisis.” The ads “will depict Trump as showing leadership in the face of opposition from Democrats and the media,” Politico reported.

Revising history to suit their political interests is something that all politicians do. Trump and company, however, are brazenly attempting to do so even as the body count continues to rise and the economy is still sinking. Thirty days ago, at the start of April, there were around a million cases reported worldwide and about fifty thousand deaths globally. Today, there are more than a million cases and more than sixty thousand deaths in the United States alone. More people have died of the coronavirus in our nation’s capital than in the entire country of Greece. As for the economy, new unemployment figures released on Thursday revealed that more than thirty million Americans have filed for jobless benefits since the crisis began, and economists predict a thirty-per-cent drop in G.D.P. in the second quarter of this year—the sort of plunge not seen since the Great Depression. How is this a “great success”?",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/trump-and-the-1917-pandemic-that-wasnt
"['Sam Knight', 'Sam Knigh', 'Colin Marshal']",2020-05-05,The Comforting and Misleading Political Response to Britain’s Coronavirus Disaster,"On Sunday, the toll from Britain’s outbreak of COVID-19 surpassed twenty-eight thousand deaths. You don’t need a graph, or to argue about the methodological niceties of how governments count their dead, to understand that the United Kingdom has had a terrible encounter with the virus. Britain has an internationally respected public-health apparatus. In October, 2016, the government ran Exercise Cygnus, a simulation of how a global influenza pandemic would overwhelm the nation’s health system and ravage the economy. Last year, Britain’s National Security Risk Assessment highlighted the risk of a mutated-flu outbreak as one of the worst—and most likely—risks facing the country, as well as the possibility of “an emerging respiratory coronavirus infection” arriving in the U.K. The Department of Health continues to describe Britain as “one of the most prepared countries in the world for pandemics.” And yet. In the weeks after December 30th, last year, when Chinese officials first informed the World Health Organization of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, the U.K. made no striking plans to respond. Even as the virus tore through Northern Italy, and the British authorities had a chance to see, at relatively close quarters, what COVID-19 could do to a prosperous European society, they dithered. Countries such as Germany, South Korea, and Singapore, which have responded well to the virus, all appear to have followed a similar playbook of mass testing, contact tracing, and collective vigilance. Each nation that has failed is more likely to have its own particular story of what went wrong. We are unhappy in our own way.

In Britain, the most obvious misstep by Boris Johnson’s government was its hesitation to implement a national lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. During February and the early part of March, Johnson and his Cabinet embraced and then abandoned the concept of herd immunity. On March 13th, Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who is the government’s chief modeller of the pandemic, told the BBC that in an ideal world there would be “a nice big epidemic” among the healthy part of the population. “What we are going to have to try and do, ideally, is . . . manage this acquisition of herd immunity and minimize the exposure of people who are vulnerable,” he said. Ministers quickly denied that this was the strategy, because it entailed the risk of two hundred and fifty thousand deaths, but Johnson did not switch to stringent quarantine measures until March 23rd. There was a directionless, ten-day period in which the virus was able to circulate more or less freely. Soccer matches and horse-racing festivals went ahead. Johnson joked about shaking people’s hands. Thousands of people became infected and later died. The reasons behind this drift are complex and contested. Since the start of the crisis, Britain’s politicians have sworn that they were following “the science,” even when it was clear that they were latching onto concepts, such as herd immunity and behavioral fatigue (in which people would supposedly tire of social-distancing measures), because they liked the sound of them. At the same time, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, a revolving panel of some twenty experts, and its various specialist subcommittees, also appears to have given advice that was politically viable rather than aimed solely at saving lives.

But Britain’s slow lockdown offers only a partial explanation for what has followed. Germany shut down one day earlier but has had around a quarter of the deaths from COVID-19, among a larger and older population. On March 12th, the U.K. gave up on testing for the coronavirus outside hospitals. By April 1st, of the National Health Service’s half a million front-line health-care workers, only two thousand had been tested. (More than a hundred have now died.) In late March, Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, told reporters that large-scale testing and tracing—as was being practiced successfully in South Korea and Singapore—was not suitable for the U.K. “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention,” she said.

There has been a curious mixture of superiority and fatalism about Britain’s entire response to COVID-19. Officials have maintained that the country has “a perfectly adequate supply” of personal protective equipment, but this has never been the case. Last week, the Royal College of Physicians reported that about a third of doctors performing “aerosol-generating procedures” did not always have access to either visors or surgical gowns. On May 3rd, a survey of sixteen thousand doctors found that forty-eight per cent had bought or obtained pieces of P.P.E. outside official channels. Among the wider population, polls show that around eighty per cent of people believe that the lockdown should continue. This is sometimes taken as approval of the government’s handling of the crisis. But it is unclear how much support for the lockdown derives from fear. During March, the number of patients coming to emergency rooms across England fell by twenty-nine per cent. The number of people who were treated for suspected heart attacks fell by half.

As in other countries, the death toll from COVID-19 has been mapped onto existing inequalities. Residents of the most deprived communities in England and Wales have died from the disease at more than twice the rate of those who live in the wealthiest. Once age and geography have been taken into consideration, patients with Pakistani or black African heritage who have been treated for COVID-19 have died at roughly three times the rate of white patients. While the N.H.S. has not been overwhelmed by the outbreak, in April the country’s care-home system reported three thousand and ninety-six deaths in the space of seven days. After the 2008 financial crisis, public funding for adult social care in England fell by about fifteen per cent and has still not recovered. “We only knew about the first case because there was a sign on the door saying not to go in without a mask on,” an elder-care assistant told the Manchester Evening News last week, about an outbreak in her facility. When she started a recent shift, there were two masks for six carers. The other four wore towels on their faces. “We have to lie to families and tell them they were settled, comfortable and peaceful. We can’t tell the truth because it will break their hearts even more,” another nurse told the newspaper. “They have temperatures which create hallucinations, they are extremely agitated. They see people, animals, they try to grab out.”

Johnson’s government has done its utmost to frame the coronavirus like any other political challenge. Since the election of Tony Blair’s media-savvy New Labour administration, in the late nineties, there has been a sort of manual that British politicians have followed when faced with an insuperable problem. One technique is to invent objective-sounding “tests” for awkward decisions. In 1997, Blair’s chancellor, Gordon Brown, devised “five tests” for joining Europe’s single currency, which Britain somehow never quite passed. Another approach is to declare a bold, eye-catching target and make that the story. In 2010, David Cameron promised that he would reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.K. to fewer than a hundred thousand per year, something that he had neither the means nor the inclination to achieve. On April 16th, Johnson’s Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, duly set out the five tests for easing the lockdown, at least one of which—avoiding a second wave of infections that swamps the N.H.S.—seems like a hopeful guess, at best. Last week, the British media feverishly covered the race to perform a hundred thousand coronavirus tests per day by the end of April, the distracting goal set by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary. (The target was met by putting some fifty thousand tests in the mail on April 30th.) When outlets have investigated the government’s poor handling of the pandemic, they have been accused of bias and misreading the public mood. Last weekend, the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, complained to the BBC about its reporting on the shortage of P.P.E.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-comforting-and-misleading-political-response-to-britains-coronavirus-disaster
"['John Cassidy', 'John Cassid', 'Charles Duhig', 'Isaac Chotine']",2020-05-05,The White House’s Push to Reopen the Economy This Early Is a Dangerous Gamble,"At the start of last week, Jonathan Swan, of Axios, reported that the “White House plans to shift its coronavirus messaging toward boosting the economy and highlighting ‘success stories’ of businesses, reducing its public emphasis on health statistics.” The story proved to be accurate. Rather than having Donald Trump appear at a daily coronavirus briefing, his staff set up a series of meetings with business leaders for him to attend. And this past weekend, the White House dispatched two of its economic advisers to appear on television.

“By the end of May, almost every state will be mostly open economically,” Kevin Hassett, a former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who recently rejoined the Administration, told Fox & Friends. “We are going to monitor the situation closely, but make no mistake about it, it’s really, really good news that we’ve been able to open up as soon as we have, and to do so according to the guidelines that doctors”—Deborah Birx, the coördinator of the White House coronavirus task force, and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—“set out.” Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, echoed Hassett’s message. In appearances on CNN and Fox Business, Kudlow predicted that the economy would rebound strongly in the second half of the year, and he said that 2021 could be a “spectacular” year. During a virtual town hall held at the Lincoln Memorial, on Sunday night, Trump didn’t go quite that far. But he did insist that it is possible to end the shutdowns and reopen the economy while protecting the vulnerable. “I think you can really have it both ways,” he said.

With Florida, Missouri, and a number of other states allowing many businesses to reopen on Monday morning, the White House’s pivot from messaging about fighting the virus to promoting the economy seemed to be complete. According to a running tally that the Times maintains, twenty-four states in total had already ordered a partial reopening of their economies. But then came a pair of shocking developments.

At lunchtime on Monday, the Times published some details of an internal “situation update” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The update, which also bore the seal of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security, included a chart showing the number of daily deaths caused by COVID-19 rising steadily over the next month and reaching about three thousand—which is roughly seventy per cent more than the current level—by the start of June. Another chart showed the daily number of new cases rising to more than two hundred thousand during the same period, which would represent an even bigger increase in relative terms. In the past few days, the number of positive tests in the U.S. has averaged about thirty thousand, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

The White House quickly issued a statement distancing itself from the new projections and saying they hadn’t even been submitted to the coronavirus task force. “This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed,” the statement said. “The President’s phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious diseases experts in the federal government agreed with.”

Later on Monday, the Washington Post reported that the projections were the work of Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, who had showed his data to the C.D.C. “as a work in progress.” Lessler told the Post that his projections weren’t intended as a forecast, and he didn’t know how they ended up in the C.D.C. update. But Lessler also said that while “the exact numbers and charts in the CDC document may differ from the final results, they do show accurately how Covid-19 cases could spiral out of control.” According to the Post, “He said 100,000 cases per day by the end of the month is within the realm of possibility. Much depends on political decisions being made today.”

One thing we’ve learned over the past couple of months is not to place too much stock in any single set of projections. All such predictions are acutely sensitive to assumptions about things like social distancing, travel, and ease of transmission. But even if this particular set of simulations should be treated with caution, the consensus among medical experts is that reopening the economy while the virus is still spreading represents a risky strategy, and the earlier the reopenings take place, the greater the risks.

Also on Monday, the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, at the University of Washington, issued a new projection that showed the cumulative death total rising to a hundred and thirty-five thousand by early August—a big increase over the institute’s previous forecast, which was issued in April and predicted about sixty thousand deaths. “The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,” the institute, whose model some states rely on to help plan their medical needs, said in a press release. “Increases in testing and contact tracing, along with warming seasonal temperatures—factors that could help slow transmission—do not offset rising mobility, thereby fueling a significant increase in projected deaths.”

These warnings echoed statements by other experts and public-health officials, including one who used to work for the Trump Administration. In an op-ed published in Monday’s Wall Street Journal, Scott Gottlieb, who was the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration from 2017 to 2019, pointed out that while the shutdowns and social distancing have had a big effect in places like New York City, the national figures for deaths and new infections have stayed pretty steady over the past month. “Mitigation hasn’t failed; social distancing and other measures have slowed the spread,” Gottlieb wrote. “But the halt hasn’t brought the number of new cases and deaths down as much as expected or stopped the epidemic from expanding.” He added, “as states begin to open up their economies and Americans return to traveling, the disease will continue to expand.”

That doesn’t necessarily mean that reopening some parts of the economy is unjustified. The economic shutdown is also imposing huge costs, and governments throughout the world are looking for ways to reduce those costs while protecting the vulnerable and continuing to reduce the infection rate. The reopening guidelines that the White House task force issued in mid-April said states that want to relax their stay-at-home orders should meet a number of requirements. Among them were having a “robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing,” and insuring that “sentinel surveillance sites are screening for asymptomatic cases . . . at locations that serve older individuals, lower-income Americans, racial minorities, and Native Americans.”

In many parts of America, this essential preparatory work simply hasn’t been done. Nationwide, the level of testing is running at about two hundred and fifty thousand a day, which is far below the level that many independent medical experts recommend. Last week, some Harvard researchers and the health-news site STAT released a study of individual states, including ones that were planning to reopen soon. “To catch hot spots before they turn into wildfires of disease, Georgia must do 9,600 to 10,000 tests per day; it has been averaging around 4,000,” the study said. “Florida will need 16,000; in the last week it has been hitting just above 10,000.” Texas, which allowed many stores and restaurants to reopen last Friday despite a new case count that is still rising, is another big state that is doing far less testing than experts recommend.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-white-houses-push-to-reopen-the-economy-this-early-is-a-dangerous-gamble
"['Masha Gessen', 'Masha Gesse']",2020-05-05,The Political Consequences of Loneliness and Isolation During the Pandemic,"For many of us during the coronavirus pandemic, self-isolation describes the extent to which we can act to protect ourselves and others, solitude describes the best we can hope for, and loneliness describes what we actually feel. By “us,” I mean people who have the luxury of self-isolating, and the luxury of striving for solitude. Those who are not self-isolating—the doctors and nurses, the delivery workers who make the self-isolation of others possible—are, for most of their waking hours, often in a state of both isolation and loneliness, because they are deprived of the ability to choose their own company.

The most complicated and precise descriptions of isolation, solitude, and loneliness are offered by Hannah Arendt, in the last chapter of “The Origins of Totalitarianism.” Loneliness, Arendt posits, is the defining condition of totalitarianism and the common ground of all terror. Isolation and solitude flank loneliness as two related but distinct conditions. Arendt’s examples—slaves and the subjects of modern totalitarian states—are both isolated and lonely, but not alone. Isolation, she writes, “may be the beginning of terror; it certainly is its most fertile ground; it always is its result.” Isolation is the inability to act together with others, which, according to Arendt, is the source of a person’s political power. Isolation renders people impotent.

One can be lonely and not isolated, or isolated and not lonely. A person who is isolated cannot act with others, but still can act—still can create and send those creations out into the world. Loneliness is the inability to act altogether, either with others or alone. Arendt links loneliness to the states of uprootedness and superfluousness: having no place in the world, nothing to give to the world. This, in turn, is linked to the loss of what she calls “common sense”—the shared reality that allows us to know ourselves, to know where we end and the world begins, and how we are connected to others.

“We live without feeling the country beneath our feet // our words are inaudible from ten steps away,” the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam wrote, in 1933, summing up the state of totalitarian loneliness, the loss of sense of time and place, the disappearance of society and of any hope of being heard or seen. When there is no connection to others, there can be no voice. Arendt writes about isolation and loneliness as the preconditions, instruments, and products of tyranny. We, in the virtual “here” today, are not the subjects of a tyrant or a totalitarian regime, and the terror we have experienced is not wielded by human hands, although it is exacerbated by them. Yet Arendt’s observations on isolation and loneliness have a piercing resonance today that they didn’t have eight or twelve weeks ago.

Every Sunday, I meet my best friends in Moscow on Zoom. The loss of sense of time and space means that a seven-hour time difference has little impact on our ability to drink simultaneously, and the distance between us—a distance that used to be measured in kilometres, hours, and dollars required to traverse it—has become an abstraction. My friends in Moscow are functionally as close and as far as my friend whose house is a short bike ride away. (Her house is, but she is an image on the screen.) More strikingly, it has been a long time since my friends in Moscow and I have inhabited a shared reality—have had as much of a “common sense”—as we do now. We experience similar isolation, fear, helplessness, and anger. We compare notes on schools that do not teach, hospitals that do not heal, and governments that betray us.

Our conversations revolve around absences. We talk about the ways in which we don’t see people. I have been staying in the same town as my father and my oldest friend, without seeing them. When I finally saw my father, after seven weeks, we wore masks and stood far apart, making the familiar details of our faces invisible. Our muffled voices were barely audible ten steps away. With my friend on Zoom, whom I see more clearly, as long as she stays in the frame, we talk about the not seeing, the many ways of not knowing: what the tests mean, if anything; when this pandemic will be over; what the world will be like when it is.

Gradually, though, the ground seems to be seeping out from under those conversations. Our common sense is wearing thin. Or perhaps it’s becoming too thick: what we experience during our weeks of isolation may be a matter of common sense in that we are experiencing similar things, but these things are internal, intimate, difficult to articulate—it’s difficult, too, to know whether they should be put into words. For the first few weeks, we traded news and impressions of our lives, updating one another on the speed and manner of the shutdowns in our respective cities. We traded notes on experiencing shock or nostalgia at the intrusion of a sound or a sight from life before the pandemic, such as hearing the voices of a few drunken men together out in the street. Then the world faded away.

What constitutes a new experience now? A man I barely know tells me, during a professional conversation over Zoom, that he has not touched anyone in weeks and that his sexuality is atrophying. Another acquaintance, the art curator Ruth Noack, posts, on Facebook, “I just realized that I have not touched another living being, nor have I been touched, for more than 4 weeks. I wonder whether we will later on have split humanity into those who were touched and those who were not.” Those who are self-isolating in the company of others, meanwhile, have fights, doubts, highs and lows in their relationships, clashes about child rearing—all of the ways in which happy, unhappy, and fluctuating families, following a finite number of patterns under quarantine, create what common sense we have. We have always had these fights, fears, and heartaches in the intimate sphere, but they were generally shielded from the eyes of others. Now private lives are the only ones we are living. What does this do to friendship, which always, in its many meanings, straddles the boundary between private and public? Where is the boundary now, when all communal space is gone?

And what happens to the physical public spaces, while we leave them vacant? At the dawn of the era of self-isolation, in the initial burst of memes, songs, and other cultural productions, a Russian Web-based cartoon called “Masyanya,” which is now in its twentieth year of existence, posted an episode on the coronavirus. In it, the titular character, an eternally grumpy and sarcastic stick figure, self-quarantines for a year with her husband and two kids. They nail boards across their door, leaving only a thin horizontal slot for pizza deliveries, and Masyanya ponders the Russian word for “outside,” snaruzhi, which she converts to a noun: naruzha. It sounds repellant. “ ‘Naruzha’ is violence, illness, politics, filth, viruses, rudeness, crime, and other crap,” Masyanya announces, at the beginning of the family’s self-isolation. At the end, they peek out of their house. “What is that?” Masyanya asks. “The sky? That’s a piece of crap. Screw it, this naruzha—it’s nothing but trouble. I can show you the woods in V.R., and it will blow you away.” With that, she nails the door shut again.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-political-consequences-of-loneliness-and-isolation-during-the-pandemic

Three months ago, Kai Wright, the host of WNYC’s “The United States of Anxiety,” joined David Remnick for a special episode of The New Yorker Radio Hour about the effects of mass incarceration and the movement to end it. Now, as the coronavirus pandemic puts inmates in acute and disproportionate danger, that effort may be gaining new traction. Wright and Remnick reconvene to examine the COVID-19 crisis in prison and its political effects. Remnick also speaks with Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, who has signed an executive order to release certain at-risk inmates from the state’s prisons—the sort of measure that would once have been deeply unpopular and risky. “I haven’t really spent any time on the politics,” Governor Murphy says. “In all the steps we’ve taken, we’re trying to make the call as best we can, based on the facts, based on the data, based on the science.” And Wright interviews Udi Ofer, the head of the A.C.L.U.’s Justice Division, who notes that “the communities that the C.D.C. has told us are most vulnerable to COVID-19 are exactly the communities that are housed in our nation’s jails and prisons,” including a disproportionately older population among inmates. Given the lack of social distancing in jails and prisons and, in many cases, substandard hygienic conditions, Ofer says that the need to reduce the inmate population “literally is a life-and-death situation.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/the-pandemic-is-wreaking-havoc-in-americas-prisons-and-jails
"['Peter C. Baker', 'Peter C. Bake', 'The New Yorke']",2020-05-04,Making a Supercut of the Sounds of Quarantine,"Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt, as the electronica duo Matmos, had quilted together piles of thematically similar audio samples before quarantine. Photograph by Jonathan Hanson / Redux

On April 1st, the musician Drew Daniel tweeted a request for people to send him recordings. He would take whatever people sent, he wrote, and stitch them together into a single track about daily life in the age of social distancing, cancelled school, and working (or not) from home. Daniel, who, along with his husband, M.C. Schmidt, makes up the electronic-music duo Matmos, thought that he would get maybe thirty submissions. In the first week, he got forty-five. In the second week, sixty. In the third, eighty. Files came from all over: Brooklyn, Kentucky, Italy, the Czech Republic, Kenya. Some were thirty seconds long or less; some stretched to thirty minutes. Some had descriptive labels—“roasting beets,” “eating apocalypse snacks”—and others were more mysterious. The final result, a fifteen-minute track called “Quarantine Supercut,” went live today at the Creative Independent, an arts Web site published by the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The project was originally conceived by Brandon Stosuy, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Creative Independent.

Daniel’s résumé made him the track’s perfect overseer (or, in his words, “stitch witch”). Multiple Matmos records were quilted together from piles of thematically similar audio samples. “Quasi-Objects” primarily features samples from around Daniel and Schmidt’s home. “A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure” is built around recordings of medical procedures. “Ultimate Care II” is composed entirely of sounds made by the couple’s Whirlpool Ultimate Care II laundry machine. Asking Daniel to take on the sounds of quarantine was almost comically apt, like asking Andy Warhol over to have a stab at painting your soup cans.

When I first spoke to Daniel, he was still working his way through all the submissions, sorting them into like piles—cat sounds here, homeschooling sounds here, coughs here—and formulating his plan of attack. He was enjoying himself, he told me, feeling like he was travelling without leaving his house in Baltimore, where he teaches English at Johns Hopkins University. But he couldn’t decide on a strategy: should he be aiming for something that would calm listeners down, he asked me rhetorically, or instead for a piece that spoke more fully to the unease and fears of so many isolated lives today?

In the end, he did a bit of both. The track’s opening movement has a soft, languorous vibe. Listening to it, I felt cast back to the earliest days of sheltering in place, when, despite the panic in the air, the whole thing had, for those not serving on the front lines, something of the novelty of a snow day or sick day. Ice clinks against glass. A drink is poured. An electric kettle hisses to life. A cat purrs. A neighborhood’s residents cheer for medical workers, or themselves, or both. Popcorn pops. “We could make bread!” someone says, excitedly.

Around the five-minute mark, though, the tension spikes. A yappy little dog yaps louder than anyone wants a yappy little dog yapping inside. A father pesters his daughter about homework; she tells him that she’s not in the mood. It doesn’t sound like their first time discussing the issue. A Zoom or FaceTime or Google Hangout or Skype meeting glitches. Listening to the speech distorting beyond the point of intelligibility, I felt my heart tightening. Quotidian domestic noises that would not have been out of place in the calm opening section start swirling together in a stereo-panned stress cocktail. “I don’t want to play monster trucks,” a young girl says. “And you’re not leaving me alone, Sam. I want a couple seconds just to myself!”

Things get calm again, but it’s not the same calm—especially because, in a dynamic that many will recognize, it’s hard not to find yourself waiting for everything to get stressful again. The virus itself only appears once, just before the ten-minute mark, when we hear someone listening online to instructions about how to prepare for a visit to a testing site. “The piece is not about the virus,” Daniel told me after he’d finished putting it together. “I’m not going to hospitals, and I’m not trying to do something vicarious about suffering. I’m more interested in social life, in what it’s like for the majority of people—people who aren’t sick or working in hospitals—to live through pandemics, which means moments of pleasure and moments of frustration. I don’t think quarantine has one mood. I think it has these tragic-comedic swerves.”

I won’t say how “Quarantine Supercut” ends—how its interplay of calm and claustrophobic disconnection resolves—just that I found myself surprised, on first listen, how much suspense I felt around the question. It was as if, having entered a simplified miniature model of our new normal, built entirely by snippets of representative sound, I was hoping that it would conclude by showing me the way out or revealing what happened next. This is, of course, too much to ask from fifteen minutes of sound, which in the end can only reveal so much. “Sometimes a potato chip crunching is just a potato chip crunching,” Daniel said. “Sometimes a cough is just a cough.” But sometimes it’s more than that.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/making-a-supercut-of-the-sounds-of-quarantine
"['Isaac Chotiner', 'Isaac Chotine']",2020-05-04,A New York Congressman Says Trump Shows No Malice,"Getting the testing going, you said?

Yeah, I’m saying once you got going, it is going. We were never built to be a national-testing country. It was always done by private labs and locals. Anyway, he is mobilizing that, and it was a slow start, but it has been slow all over the world, really, except maybe for South Korea or something, Taiwan.

So you have testing moving along, and, as far as supplying the states, if you could think back to a month ago, the feeling was there wouldn’t be enough ventilators, the hospitals would be overrun. And now you have Cuomo giving away ventilators. Now, that’s what was done as an executive. And when [Trump] gets into fights with reporters, sometimes it confuses the issue. Again, he has to realize that everything he says, people either take it seriously or they look at it seriously. I wouldn’t have said it if I were him, but, when he’s talking about Clorox or whatever it was, Lysol or something, could there be some element in those things that scientists could use? You know, just like when you inject chemotherapy into a person, that’s poison, but the scientists are able to refine it. I guess that’s what he meant.

Right. You have to give him the benefit of the doubt. He’s the President.

Yeah. I would think he would be better advised to just talk about what’s positive. Don’t be calling on Jim Acosta every week. It should be strictly science, strictly medicine, and exactly what we’re going to do.

I’m reading this book on Churchill now. You realize how many screwups there were. In the first month after Churchill became Prime Minister, and then after the United States got in the war, how many battles didn’t go the right way that we got engaged in? [Trump] shouldn’t let himself get bogged down about what he’s saying.

There could be a situation where we look back in four years and we say, “Look, there were mistakes about testing. There were mistakes about injecting disinfectants, but, fundamentally, he got the job done.”

Yeah. When somebody asks him, “Could the coronavirus come back worse in the fall?” Sure, it could. Instead of saying no, say, “We hope it doesn’t. But, believe me, we’re going to be ready for it. We learned our lesson. We’re going to have the testing, we’re going to be able to spot it early on. We’re going to be able to move our resources very quickly.”

I was reading an interview where you said, “There’s not many Republicans in Congress supporting President Trump on the gut issues. How many are out there defending him on Russia? Defending him on the travel ban? So that’s why those issues are gut issues I support him on.” It seems like there is a “gut” aspect of Trumpism that you two see eye to eye on, even if you don’t agree on every policy.

Yes, definitely. And the fact is that we’re roughly the same age. I’m a couple of years older. We both grew up in Queens. And when I see him, even with all his money and all that, he’s like guys I knew on the street corner in Queens.

You once said, “Guys I grew up with? They think he’s like one of the guys on the street corner. I mean he’s like—with all his billions and jets and hotels and golf courses—he’s very much the guy they hang out with.”

Yeah. And I find when I’m with him—and it’s not that often, I was at the wrestling match with him in the city, he invited me to that, and I’ve been with him a number of times—I have to keep reminding myself that this is the President, because he’s a regular guy. I mean, the language, the expressions, the faces, laughing and joking around. A smart guy, don’t get me wrong, but people sense that.

I first noticed this when he announced, in June, 2015. I’d be at my grandson’s Little League games, and there were people there who are level-headed guys, lawyers, accountants—regular middle-class, middle-income people, not overly political. They’re saying, “This guy Trump, I really like what he says.” I never really asked them exactly what it was they liked. They said, “He’s one of us”—like that. That was their tone.

The street-corner talk, or locker-room talk. That’s part of his personality.

Yeah. And it’s genuine. Again, you have people say he’s not a politician, but it goes beyond that. He’s used to the world where you say what you do to get through the day. You have to entertain—not entertain, you have to almost please the crowd you’re in front of. I remember, in 2016, when there was several times some excess in what he said, and I was talking to somebody in his headquarters about it. And they said, “Well, the thing is that he is at heart an entertainer, a salesman. Both.” So when he says something that’s funny or something that really strikes a chord with the crowd, his immediate attitude is, O.K., you like that, I’ll give you a better one. And he keeps upping the ante.

That can get into trouble with things like “Lock her up,” or when you say “Go back where you came from,” no?

Yeah, that’s part of it. There are some of the things he said. I didn’t see any malice in it, any of that.

No malice?

No, I don’t believe any malice. No, I mean, I’ve never seen malice in him.

Oh, O.K.

I don’t see it. Now, again, others may, but he seems sometimes genuinely surprised when people take offense to everything. To him, you have an argument, you’re back-and-forthing. You’re solid the next day.

Right. I think, with things like birtherism or Charlottesville, people saw a fair amount of malice in that.

Birtherism, I never really understood that. First of all, at the time, I guess there was always something in the back of your head. Anyone can be born out of the country, who knows? I assume—first of all, so what?

I think because President Obama is the first African-American President and—

Oh, I know. Look, I’m saying, “So what?” In that, to me, it never raised any kind of an issue. I wouldn’t have cared. I mean, if some guy’s mother happened to be out of the country the day he was born—in any event, so you know, why race? And I don’t know if it was even a racial issue so much as [Trump] could go after you on any issue. But, anyway, that’s subject to interpretation. I wouldn’t have raised birthplace, I never did.

And the Charlottesville stuff and the “Mexican” judge?

In Charlottesville, again, this is where he strings things together. I think he was trying to say there are some people who have legitimate, historical purposes. They think that you shouldn’t take down Robert E. Lee’s statue, or whatever.

Good people on both sides, right.

Yeah, both sides. But I think it was really three sides, if you will. Maybe there’s one side who had some historical beliefs that you shouldn’t be taking down people like Robert E. Lee, maybe a Jefferson Davis, I don’t know, Stonewall Jackson. But, on the other hand, there were also those who were racists and bigots and everything else. I think, whenever [Trump]’s challenged, he goes off the top. He says stuff off the top of his head. That, I think, in his mind was the “both sides.” Because I’ve never seen him or heard him say anything racist at all. I mean, in New York, he was—say, one area I would disagree with—he was a friend of Michael Jackson. I couldn’t stand Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson, he was living in Trump Tower for a while.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/a-new-york-congressman-says-that-trump-shows-no-malice
"['Charles Bethea', 'Charles Bethe', 'Brent Cran', 'Alice Gregor']",2020-05-05,Teen Crisis Counsellors Are Still On Call,"McCaleb Nesseler-Cass Illustration by João Fazenda

On a recent Thursday, in Portland, Oregon, McCaleb Nesseler-Cass got out of bed five minutes before his ten o’clock check-in at Central Catholic High School. “It doesn’t compare to real school,” he said of the online version. He went back to sleep. After lunch, he headed to the basement to lift weights. “Self-care,” he said. “I’ve got my weights. I’ve got my video games. And sanitizing carts at Trader Joe’s,” where he works on the weekends. (“Makes people feel better.”) After an hour of reading about “the five pillars of Islam,” and a couple playing Super Smash Bros., he got into his Toyota Sienna, cranked up “Althea”—Grateful Dead, 1980—and drove to an office where he volunteers at YouthLine, a crisis line for teens.

“It’s not for school or anything,” McCaleb, who is eighteen, said. “Men, especially, hide their feelings. I just try to support them.” He wore a tie-dyed Dead T-shirt, jeans, and skater shoes, on which he’d scrawled, “People who do this suck.” Irony. He arrived at the office, where seven other teen-age volunteers—all girls—were seated and masked at their spaced-out desks. A supervisor pointed a thermometer gun at McCaleb’s forehead. “You’re good,” she said. McCaleb masked up and said hi to a schoolmate named Maddi, who was wearing knee-high boots and had pasted rhinestones around her eyes.

In March, YouthLine received nearly twenty-two hundred messages and calls, compared with around fourteen hundred twelve months earlier. The virus has necessitated a larger room. “More space is dope,” McCaleb said. The air was thick with the scent of hand sanitizer and the sound of typing. Also, Beyoncé.

After wiping down his desk, McCaleb checked the messages on his computer. “This person is a preteen,” he said, examining the first one. “They’re having trouble with their gender identity.” He added, “They’re really scared to tell their parents while quarantined.” McCaleb typed a response. “They asked me how old I am,” he said—a question that the volunteers frequently get from callers. “I said I’m in high school. I didn’t want to say I’m eighteen—that could be kind of imposing.” (Later, he gently told another caller, “I’m not an adult,” but the caller didn’t believe him, and hung up.) McCaleb turned to schoolwork while he waited for another message to ping. “I have this A.P. Bio video lecture on DNA,” he said. “Which is annoying.”

Maddi said, “When I was here last week, I had two contacts talk about the virus pretty much the whole time.” They felt trapped. Maddi, who lives in an apartment with her mother, related—to a point. “One was talking about how it was making them feel even more suicidal,” she said. “They were into writing, so I said it would be really fun to write letters to friends or family.” The idea seemed to take.

To Maddi’s left, Sophie, seventeen, who wore a baggy sweatshirt, played Animal Crossing on her Nintendo Switch between calls. “You live on a little island with all these animals,” she said of the game. “You, like, fish and catch bugs. It’s really cute and stress-relieving.” She talked about recent chats. “I’ve gotten abusive situations,” she said. “Now they can’t get out and go to school and escape that. They ask, ‘How long is this gonna be?’ ”

Nearby, Beth, another seventeen-year-old, wearing an olive crop top, responded to a new message. “Are you in crisis now?” she typed. “This is the crisis line.” The person, who was nine, had tried to snuggle a pet mouse during an anxious moment in quarantine, and had inadvertently choked the animal. “They’re suicidal,” Beth told Morgan, a middle-aged woman supervising the group.

“You’re amazing and wonderful,” Morgan replied, “but I’m going to take that.” After a moment, Morgan ascertained that the creature had survived. “It’s sleeping now in its cage,” she said.

A veteran volunteer across the room ended a call. “It’s so wild how some people just don’t have boundaries,” she said to the others, sighing. She took another call, this time recommending a hot bath or shower. “The other thing I’d maybe recommend,” she continued, “is an app called Calm Harm, which can sometimes help when you’re having really intense self-harm urges.”

Beth took another call. It lasted awhile. A seventeen-year-old had gone to her doctor to get tested for the virus and learned she was pregnant. “Awful timing,” Beth said to the caller, after calming her down.

McCaleb’s last chat was with a teen-ager whose sibling had recently died by suicide. “Their parents aren’t very responsive,” he said. “Like, a pat on the back and ‘You’re good.’ ” He shook his head. “Virus or no virus, it’s just hard.” He listened to “Althea” again on the drive home. The name, he later learned, means “healer.” ♦

"['Ethan Kuperberg', 'Ethan Kuperber', 'Kaitlin Cha', 'Cora Frazie']",2020-05-05,Quarantine Stew,"There’s nothing quite as meditative as cooking—it might be the only thing keeping me sane right now! This hearty stew serves five, which is perfect for my current household: me, my cat, my two porcelain dolls that have begun speaking to me, and my porcelain doll that is currently not speaking to me owing to a misunderstanding.

PREP TIME:

30 min, or a few days—what’s the difference?

INGREDIENTS:

• 3 bottles red wine

• 1 pound beef (you may substitute ice cream)

• 6 teaspoons vegetable oil

• 7 teaspoons vegetable oil if you’re feeling naughty

• 2 bay leaves

• 2 Lexapro tablets (crushed)

• 3 1/ 2 cups beef broth (you may substitute ice cream)

• Some carrots and onions or whatever. It doesn’t matter.

PREPARATION:

• Wash the onions to make sure they’re clean. Everything must be clean! Scrub them vigorously under scalding hot water with Lysol or bleach.

• Drink first bottle of red wine.

• Place the beef (or ice cream) in a large pot. Turn the news on, see a headline, then immediately turn the news off. You don’t need that right now!

• Cook the beef until it is browned on all sides. While doing this, sing Stephen Sondheim’s “Send in the Clowns” to yourself, loudly. Puzzle over why you’re only realizing now, once you’re in quarantine, that you could have pursued singing professionally. Isn’t that rich?

• Slice the onions and add them to the pot. Wait, these aren’t onions, they’re apples. Have they been apples this whole time? Is there that big of a difference between an apple and an onion, anyway?

• Slice the apples and add them to the pot.

• Call your parents and tell them that you are a chef now. Let them know that they should call you Chef, because that is your new name. Learn that your parents left the house today to deposit a check at the bank, even though they are both over sixty. Yell at them until you are all sobbing, then hang up the phone.

• Simmer.

• Add cilantro to the pot. To you, cilantro tastes like soap. But who cares? It’s the end of the world. Hey, add some real soap, too!

• Take everything else that is still in your produce drawer and throw it into the air. Whatever lands in your stew is now part of your stew! Life is random and cruel; so, too, your stew shall be!

• Reduce heat and drink fourth bottle of red wine.

• Feel offended that your cat is mocking your cooking abilities. Tell your cat that you’re under a lot of pressure right now, and she’s not going to get any stew if she calls you a philistine again. It’s hurtful.

• Almost forgot the bay leaves. Add them—to your mouth! They taste very weird. Eat the rest of the bay leaves in your pantry, and also the paprika.

• Receive text message from your parents about your fight from three days ago. Hold on, how long have you been cooking this stew for?

• Almost done! Cover pot for ten minutes, or until you feel like taking the lid off and wearing it as a hat. Ouch, your new hat feels extremely hot on your head!

• Ladle stew among five bowls while calling your parents back and telling them that you love them, to taste.

Buon appetito! Your stew is all done. Put some clothes on and enjoy! ♦

"['Françoise Mouly', 'Françoise Moul']",2020-05-05,Christoph Mueller’s “Shelter in Place”,"The coronavirus has hit different countries in different ways, but billions of people worldwide are now living with some kind of restriction on public life. This week’s cover, by Christoph Mueller, an artist based in Germany, portrays a now common experience: seeing life, and the bloom of spring, through a window. We talked to Mueller recently about the image.

Europe has been in quarantine for more than a month. Have you still been able to enjoy strolls in nature? And, if so, how has the experience shifted?

My wife, Leonie, and I live close to the Dutch border, and our favorite getaway is a small heathland nature reserve in the Netherlands. It’s an incredibly beautiful place that has an almost spiritual effect on me. Unfortunately, nonessential people are not allowed to cross the borders at the moment, so we’ve switched to taking our strolls through small local parks. They’re nice, but I do miss those Dutch pines. Fortunately, we had a chance to collect some seeds during our last visit to the heathlands, and we’re now growing a pine forest in the living room of our apartment.

Has sheltering in place made you more or less aware of what’s going on outside your window?

Much more aware—and I mean that quite literally. I’ve developed a habit of looking out the window right after I get up in the morning: I step into the living room, greet Wembley and Schlomi, our two cockatiels, and stare outside the window for a while, almost like I am searching for some sort of confirmation, for signs of normality, some real-life feedback that lets me know that we’ll be O.K. for another day. After that, I check on our baby pines and make coffee.

Does your approach shift when you set out to tell a story in one image, like this cover, versus a comic strip?

I don’t think I’ve ever thought about that. Usually, I start with the specs of what I’m aiming for, do my research, and keep thinking about it until I arrive at some sort of emotional starting point. Then the image or images just sort of work their way through my hand onto the paper. I try to not overthink the underlying mechanics too much.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2020-05-11
"['Lauren Collins', 'Lauren Collin', 'Victor Zapana', 'Alexander Maksi']",2020-05-05,Reinventing Grief in an Era of Enforced Isolation,"Father Michael, a priest my family has never met, in a city we never identified, gave my father a version of the last rites over the telephone on the night of April 4th. My father, John Collins, had received a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia in January. After spending nearly two months undergoing chemotherapy at Duke University Medical Center, in Durham, North Carolina, he was finally discharged from the hospital in mid-March, just as the coronavirus pandemic broke out. He and my mother, Sue, returned to their home in Wilmington. Everyone was scrambling. There were cancelled appointments, appointments rescheduled for Zoom; Zoom appointments cancelled, too, when my father’s new, outpatient doctors, having determined that it was too risky for him to continue commuting to Durham, acknowledged that they couldn’t very well devise a treatment plan without being able to physically examine him.

The coronavirus may have accelerated his decline, or it may not have. Leukemia was the disease at fault. Still, the demands on medical personnel, amid the general chaos, made recovering at home dangerous and dying at home unworkable. On the afternoon of April 3rd, my father entered a hospice center. He had not been a churchgoer in recent years, and hadn’t attended a Catholic church since adolescence. Still, we knew that last rites were something he wanted, so we tried hard to make it happen. In the course of the evening and the next day, my mother called “a zillion friends” to try to rustle up a Catholic officiant. No one local would come. Her friend’s sister-in-law’s acquaintance finally found a willing Father Michael somewhere in California. “Just heard from one priest who does not know how to do FaceTime,” the friend’s sister-in-law texted. “He’s now checking with another priest. If he’s tech savvy, he can do all except the anointing.”

I learned about this when I woke up in Paris on April 5th and checked my WhatsApp messages. “Sorry you missed it, but had to take the call when he rang,” my mother had written, referring to the priest, at 2:39 A.M. I should have had my ringer on. I had also missed a video call at 6:11, and one at 6:13. I called my mother at 6:19, and she told me that my father had died. It took me a few minutes to switch on the light in my bedroom, during which time I appeared to my mother in the form of a pitch-black rectangle. She asked if I wanted to see him, and, not really knowing whether I did, I said yes. First, she aimed the camera at the door (“Mom, that’s the door”), and then she turned it toward the bed, where my father’s body lay. The bad lighting and the slow connection produced greenish, unfiltered alloys of pixel and flesh.

Despite having lived abroad for a decade, I’d always thought of FaceTime as a weak substitute for first-order interaction, whether in person or in writing. Like Diet Coke, it was to be avoided except when there were no other decent options. Better to have the real thing, less frequently, than to settle for constant interruptions and glitches. Video calls are unsatisfying not just because of the lack of touch but because they require mutual active presence. Conversation is only a part of companionship. It’s hard to just be when you’re on a call, hard to see when you’re constantly looking.

Because of the coronavirus, I was quarantined in France. When we’d last pushed for a prognosis, in early March, my father’s doctors had guessed that he had somewhere between a year and eighteen months left to live. I had a ticket home for March 19th, but, after the pandemic hit, we decided to postpone the visit. Soon, though, it became clear that my father’s condition was deteriorating. The doctors could see it in his blood-cell counts, but I understood that he was dying when, one afternoon, my kids demanded that he do the Funky Chicken, as he often did for them on FaceTime. After a knockout performance—elbows flapping, knees knocking, bent low enough that he could reach down and slap the floor—he collapsed back into his deck chair, and said that he needed to sleep.

I tried to find a way to join him, my mother, and my brother, who lives in Wilmington with his wife and young children. One flight a day was still operating from Paris to the United States. On April 4th, it was headed to Los Angeles. On the fifth, it was going to J.F.K., landing in New York in the late afternoon. To get to Wilmington, I would then either rent a car and drive ten hours or spend the night in a hotel, take a taxi to LaGuardia the next morning, and catch two more flights. In the end, these were fantasy itineraries, dark mirrors of the vacations that people have passed the pandemic imagining in extravagant detail, as a way to transcend confinement and the powerlessness that comes with it. Even if I made it home in time to see my father, I might transmit the coronavirus to my mother, who is seventy, or to other people. I might get stranded, or sick myself, in a country where I don’t have health insurance. Staying in Paris went against all my instincts, but going seemed foolhardy.

The hospice was in lockdown, but it allowed immediate family members to visit at the end of life. A mercy, and a privilege: my father wouldn’t die alone. On his last afternoon, my mother and brother sat at his bedside, occasionally putting an iPhone close to his right ear, the good one, so that I could talk to him. This was a warm moment, the best simulacrum of togetherness that we could create. But it was also distressing for me, because my father wasn’t responding, and my mother and brother couldn’t tell when I was done trying to communicate. I listened while Dad gasped for breath, waiting for someone to reclaim the phone. The ethics of attending to the dying by device are still being written. Do you mute something like that if you can?

The screen, as screens do, kept framing little pictures—grainy grotesques that I wished I could unsee. Still, I eventually took a screenshot, because I was worried about forgetting all the things that, not being there, I hadn’t had a chance to internalize. It showed my dad, his mouth bruised and bleeding a little, dressed in a weirdly pretty white gown with a dark-blue motif that reminded me of chrysanthemums. He was lying in a bed with handles. Three electrical outlets, one of them red, were visible above his head. The image kept popping up in my camera roll every time I tried to send a message or post something. I wanted to delete it, but that felt like another kind of desecration. I ended up e-mailing it to myself, just to get it off my phone, and putting it in an unnamed folder.

As I spoke to my mother on the morning of the fifth, a nurse came into the room to tell her that my father’s possessions—white socks, a phone charger—would be returned to her. The nurse also presented her with a list of undertakers. I listened in, looking, again, at some random door. “They’re awesome, they did my dad,” the nurse’s disembodied voice said, of one mortuary. Unable to see her face, I couldn’t decide what to make of that, so, tuning out, I wandered onto WhatsApp. In the space of three thumb scrolls, my conversations with my dad had gone from “I will stand, this will pass and we will embrace again before you know it” to “I hit my head—so I am in the / JWejhosp.” The final screen showed two pictures I had sent him of my kids, marked “seen” by pairs of blue checks.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/reinventing-grief-in-an-era-of-enforced-isolation
"['James Ross Gardner', 'James Ross Gardne']",2020-05-04,The End of the Beginning: Seattle Braces for the Next Phase of the Coronavirus Fight,"Social-distancing measures have helped Seattle, but officials warn that a sense of complacency could bring the virus roaring back. Photograph by Chona Kasinger

We’d reached that moment in the plot where the bad thing has set in, when the characters, while not yet embracing the new reality, have resigned themselves to it. A collective sigh. A pensive scratch of the beard, if you could still safely scratch beards. We were quarantining just like everywhere else in the country; the difference in Seattle was we’d been doing it half a month longer, maybe more. In the first region with a confirmed case, the first to log a death, we’d grown used to this retreat from the world. The walls of our homes flickered from the light on our screens. During the day, those screens filled with images of our co-workers’ laundry piles, and, at night, with the stories we binged, like the one about the man who imprisons cats and plots the death of his rival.

You could still go to the grocery store, and when you did you marvelled at what you saw, mostly because here, at last, things transpired somewhere other than on a screen, but also because there was more kindness out there than you recalled. The employee at the entrance who offered to wipe down the handle of your shopping cart. The cashier who stage-managed the line of customers so no one stood too close. Except for emergencies, hospitals were off limits, but you had your memory and imagination. You could take all the times you’d been near an E.R. or I.C.U.—the intensity, the texture of a crisis, its sounds and smells—and imprint upon them the news of the day, then just speed things up, turn up the dials. It wasn’t hard to picture a hundred acts of heroism.

After all, this was why we’d so abruptly upended our lives. We knew we must slow the spread of the coronavirus to grant health-care workers some relief, to flatten the curve, make sure enough ventilators and empty beds remained. So when it was all finally, demonstrably shown to be effective, the joy was palpable. On March 30th, at the end of what was certainly among the strangest months in Seattle’s history, the data company that supplied many of the models upon which the region’s leaders had weighed decisions made an announcement. “Social distancing and mobility reductions have reduced COVID-19 transmission in King County, WA,” the Institute for Disease Modeling stated in a publicly distributed summary paper. I.D.M.’s calculations showed that, between the end of February and mid-March, the spread rate had been cut by nearly half: before, each infected Seattleite passed the virus on to an estimated 2.7 people; on March 18th it was 1.4. Two weeks later, I.D.M. had even better news: someone with COVID-19 in late March could be expected to infect just one other individual.

Maintaining an invisible six-foot barrier between yourself and others. Washing your hands with obsessive frequency. So much time spent indoors that you’d practically committed to memory the ceiling’s cartography of cracks and bumps. After a while, these measures could feel like spells, charms to ward off supernatural forces. You believed in them because they came from women and men of science, but you’d be lying if you said you weren’t also running on something like blind faith.

Now there was the confirmation. What we did was working. To calculate the rate of the virus’s spread, the I.D.M. researchers measured public epidemiological data—including tests, diagnoses, and reported deaths—against mobility data gathered from anonymous Facebook users. The latter showed that Seattleites were indeed avoiding big gatherings and staying home; the scientists noted a twenty-seven-per-cent increase in daytime residential occupancy compared to before the social-distancing policies began, and a forty-three-per-cent decrease in occupancy in mixed-use places like downtown. There were other signs: King County Metro reported its bus ridership down forty-five per cent. Traffic on Interstate 5 fell by more than half. By April 5th, we appeared to have avoided one of the more dreaded outcomes: another research group, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, at the University of Washington, lowered its projection of deaths. It also reported a surplus rather than a deficit of available hospital beds, including I.C.U. beds. Governor Jay Inslee was so confident in the numbers, he sent back more than four hundred of the ventilators that the Strategic National Stockpile had loaned the state; New York, in more dire need, could put them to use instead.

Of course, every bit of promising news came with big caveats. We were far from in the clear, officials warned. We still are. Any time now the high spread rate could come roaring back, especially if we relax social-distance measures too soon. New confirmed cases emerge every day, as do high death tolls. People on the front line still lack proper personal protective equipment. But decelerating the virus did more than provide much-needed relief to the region’s health-care system. It offered some time, however brief, to reflect on how we’d done it.

As my colleague Charles Duhigg recently wrote in the magazine, the largest factor was relatively simple: state and local leaders here listened to the advice of scientists. Officials quickly shuttered schools and issued shelter-in-place orders. Other, harder-to-quantify factors may have helped as well. Every city has its contradictions. Seattle’s may be trickier to parse than most. Inexplicably, its residents are both civically dutiful and unfriendly. That’s according to the statistics provided by the National Conference on Citizenship, which combines census data and survey results to create its Civic Health Index.

In 2017, when measured against fifty other cities, Seattle came in either first or second in philanthropy, group participation, and the boycotting of products for ethical or political purposes. Seattleites also rank high for voter turnout. Yet, when it comes to talking to neighbors, residents ranked an abysmal thirty-fifth; though that’s up from three years earlier, when the rank was forty-eighth.

Could these two characteristics—civic duty and aloofness—help explain the city’s success with social distancing? Diane Douglas, a former executive director of Seattle City Club, which co-sponsors the index, thinks so. At least the civic-duty aspect. She’s more circumspect when it comes to the Seattle Freeze, the sobriquet by which the city’s reputation for unfriendliness is known. (Duhigg briefly touched on this as well.) When we spoke, Douglas emphasized the jump in the city’s rank in friendliness (presumably because of the influx of outsiders moving here).

Since at least the nineteen-forties, the city has taken hits for its alleged icy treatment of newcomers, as observed in archival letters to the editor from newspaper readers confessing to toils like “nearly dying of sheer loneliness for months.” Such missives led the Seattle Daily Times to aver, in a 1946 editorial, “that newcomers do not always find us altogether perfect; that we sometimes are neglectful of the stranger in our midst; that we seem unduly preoccupied with our own local concerns.” Nearly sixty years later, the same newspaper, in a 2005 article about the Seattle Freeze—likely the first time the term was committed to print—characterized the phenomenon this way: locals are “polite but distant,” or, put another way, “Have a nice day. Somewhere else.”

What makes Seattle dwellers less sociable than those in other cities? Explanations are frustratingly few and largely unsatisfying. Some posit the influence of long-timers who hail from stereotypically stoic parts of the world. (Such hypotheses unsubtly implicate the region’s large Nordic and Asian communities.) Some explanations blame the preponderance of socially inept tech workers (which hardly accounts for why the phenomenon has lingered since the pre-tech-boom forties). Still others blame the melancholy brought on by constant overcast skies. (Constant overcast skies get blamed for a lot in the Pacific Northwest.)",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-end-of-the-beginning-seattle-braces-for-the-next-phase-of-the-coronavirus-fight
"['Anthony Lane', 'Anthony Lan', 'Adam Gopni', 'Evan Osno']",2020-05-05,The Enduring Romance of the Night Train,"You can still buy plain seats on the Caledonian Sleeper, and they cost a fraction of the single or double rooms. The economics of night trains, in Europe and elsewhere, rest on two basic theorems. First, the closer you adhere to the perpendicular, the less you pay. An upright vigil in the corridor, during which you stare into the darkness and contemplate the infinite, is dirt cheap. Second, once you do lie flat, communal flatness is better value than solitude. The standard compromise is the couchette, a compartment fitted with four or six bunks: fun for a family, and rousingly unpredictable when you get tossed into a stew of strangers. Urban legends abound. Hands are said to reach up from the bunk beneath you, in response to your telltale snores, and deftly extract your wallet. And I once heard of a roving youth who, ensconced with newfound companions in a friendly couchette, was offered a cup of coffee in southern Bulgaria and woke up, two days later, in a quiet siding outside Thessaloniki, devoid of every possession except his boxer shorts. You just don’t get that level of service on a plane.

Not that high-end sleepers are devoid of risk. Habitués of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, for example, which, in defiance of its name, can shuttle you from Paris to Istanbul, are encouraged to “trade stories with fellow travellers in the Bar Car as the pianist plays.” Imagine hearing the same anecdote, from the same retired fund manager, all the way across a continent. Should you book the Cabin Suite, “formed of two interconnecting Double Cabins,” you will be granted the unique opportunity for a blazing, champagne-fuelled argument with your beloved on the first night. Having slammed the connecting door, both of you can then sulk in ultimate luxury for five long days, and all for thirty-seven thousand dollars. Each.

There’s no disguising the itch that drives the Caledonian Sleeper. It wants to be a hotel. Such is the lofty ambition on which the principle of the sleeping car is based. The pioneer of that principle was George Pullman. Not since Monsieur Guillotin came up with a device for making decapitation more user-friendly has an individual been so closely associated with a product. Pullman, born in 1831, was an engineer whose idea of a challenge was to jack up whole buildings in the mud-bound streets of Chicago, allowing drainage systems to be installed underneath. A similar aversion to mess and inconvenience was one of the motives that spurred him to introduce the Pullman sleeping car, in 1859. Ladies and gentlemen, he reasoned, would pay to travel in comfort; the plusher the comfort, the more swiftly his clients might forget that they were travelling at all. On his much improved model, of 1865, the upholstered seats were indeed covered in plush, to accompany the brass fittings and the walnut walls.

As if to demonstrate that nothing, not even tragedy, could interrupt the national genius for entrepreneurship, the funeral train that carried the body of Abraham Lincoln from Washington to Springfield, Illinois, included a Pullman car on the final leg of its journey. By then, the train, which had crossed seven states, had become a story unto itself. The market followed the mourning, and, in 1867, the Pullman Palace Car Company was founded. The wealthy, and the aspiring middle classes, were offered the chance to sleep in peace, on the move, much as their national hero had been borne to his eternal rest. The deal would be sealed when his eldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln, was made president of Pullman, in 1897, and then, in 1911, chairman of the board.

The gradual upgrading of Pullman cars can be read as a fever chart of consumers’ wants. In 1887, a vestibule was inaugurated which allowed smooth access from one carriage to another and led to such delights as the drawing room and the smoking room, aromatic with domesticity. Women travellers, growing in number, were provided with dressing rooms. Air-conditioning began to flow in 1929, and the nineteen-thirties saw the début of the Duplex and the Roomette—not a word that I could nerve myself to utter in front of a booking clerk, but, qua period detail, it has the right snap and click. In “Night Trains,” a lovingly erudite book of 2017, Andrew Martin reports that Pullman cars were also “equipped with hairdressing salons, organs (for church services) and libraries.” When a train can meet every private and civic need, why would you ever get off?

Of particular note, throughout this process, was the deployment of the beds. In America, the custom was to place them lengthways, so that your body, when horizontal, slotted into the train like a bullet in the breach of a rifle. If you want to see this arrangement at work, its neatness crying out for comic disruption, I refer you to “Some Like It Hot,” in which Sweet Sue and her band, topped by a singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), take the sleeper from Chicago to Florida. Arrayed on either side of the car’s central corridor are ranks of bunks, upper and lower, each of them guarded, demurely but uselessly, by curtains. A nocturnal party is thrown in bunk No. 7, with Manhattans mixed in a rubber hot-water bottle. You can keep your Orient Express.

In Europe, on the other hand, bunks on a night train have traditionally been set at ninety degrees to the direction of travel, like the teeth of a comb. (Of the many gulfs between the Old World and the New, this could be the most bewildering. Do American passengers, made of sterner purpose, prefer the thrustful sensation of being propelled?) A photograph from 1888 shows a private compartment, with two of the transverse bunks in place and primed for action. Every surface, including the floor and the mattresses, is sumptuously patterned and softened, as if to induce a languid hush. The name for such a haven was a “boudoir car,” and you can see why, for it breathes what one prim and titled Englishwoman scorned as “the atmosphere of vulgar depravity” that prevailed on trains de luxe. Her name, by the way, was Lady Chatterley.

To pick your way through the vestiges of the great European trains is a task not so much for historians of transport as for paleontologists. It is a lost world, in which Tsar Nicholas II could have a cow car, if you please, attached to his personal train on a visit to Germany, to keep the imperial children furnished with fresh milk. The landscape of this Trainaceous Era was crammed with rogues, chancers, visionaries, and tightfisted despots. Meet Colonel William d’Alton Mann, formerly of the Fifth Michigan Cavalry, who devised the boudoir car; King Boris of Bulgaria, who wore white overalls and stood next to the engine driver for hours on end, aflame with train lust; and Georges Nagelmackers, the indefatigable Belgian who founded La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (et des Grands Express Européens) at the age of twenty-seven. The trains running under that banner were majestic beasts, and some of the dominant predators are listed by Andrew Martin:",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/the-enduring-romance-of-the-night-train
"['Antonia Hitchens', 'Antonia Hitchen', 'Lizzie Widdicomb', 'Malcolm Gladwel']",2020-05-05,Was Quarantine Made for Cannabis?,"Illustration by João Fazenda

Late last month, while President Trump flirted with solutions to the coronavirus—sunbathing with a “very powerful light,” injecting Lysol to clean the lungs—others elected to smoke pot. In Los Angeles, as a queue of cars crept slowly in a two-hour In-N-Out Burger drive-through line, in Hollywood, a string of people, standing six feet apart, snaked down the block outside the MMD cannabis dispensary.

Mishka Ashbel, who co-owns the dispensary with his brother, Slava, said, “We get to provide a little relief to a stressed society.” Los Angeles, which shuttered its beaches and hiking trails, has deemed weed an essential service, critical to residents’ health and well-being. “On 4/20, a lot of people used coming to a dispensary as an excuse to get out of the house, to feel normal again,” Ashbel said. “To stand in that line was like a special occasion. People placed online orders for delivery starting at 4 A.M.” (Seniors get their gummies, organic pre-rolled joints, and edibles delivered free.)

“Vice industries,” such as the liquor business, do well during recessions and crises; in the first days of the shutdown, marijuana stocks outperformed the crashing S. & P. Ashbel does not consider cannabis a vice product. “This is a health product,” he said. “You feel this responsibility to the public here—we’re on the front lines. It’s uncharted territory.”

A former N.F.L. player was reprimanded by the F.D.A. for advocating cannabis as a cure for COVID-19, but many have found it crucial in coping with the pandemic. David Lonsdale, the C.E.O. of a hemp-cultivation company called CanaFarma, weighed in by phone from his Manhattan apartment. “People are looking at an over-all wellness program,” he said. “Cannabis becomes part of your daily routine, like blood-pressure medicine.”

“People are used to self-medicating, and it’s medical, yeah,” a Broadway actor who works part time as a budtender said. “But people are also just bored.”

Rudy Schreier, a cannabis consultant, said, “You wake up, you have a good breakfast, you maybe take some vitamins, you do work, you have lunch, do more work, smoke a joint, eat an edible. It’s becoming the norm since we’ve been on lockdown.” Schreier works with dispensaries to help them secure licenses. “A lot of people working from home have more time on their hands now,” he said. “In a world that’s so hectic, everyone’s wish was to have more time, and now that that wish has been granted people are, like, ‘I don’t know what to do.’ That’s where cannabis comes into play.” He went on, “I live in a house with seven other people, and during the quarantine we’ve had a couple of girlfriends here, too, so it’s like twelve of us, and pretty much everyone is smoking every day. People finish whatever they have to do for their job at, like, 2 P.M., and they’re, like, ‘What are we going to do for the rest of the day?’ ”

Schreier rushed out to two dispensaries the day that L.A.’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, advised residents to begin staying home. Since then, he’s put two cloned baby cannabis plants in his back yard. “I think that Lowe’s and Home Depot have a surge in sales, and I assume that part of that is gardening supplies,” he said. “We expect home-grows to go way up.”

There’s a side benefit to the boom: the process of extracting cannabis oil requires ethanol, so manufacturers have started producing hand sanitizer in bulk to supply the dispensaries, for customers to use. “At first, it was like a back-yard drug deal for hand sanitizers,” Ashbel said.

Ashbel thinks that smoking pot is the ideal quarantine activity. “It’s conducive to isolation, and it turns off the sensory overload from the news right now,” he said. His brother, Slava, said, “Smoking cannabis has helped people stay inside for generations!” He added, “I didn’t realize I’ve been quarantined full time since 2006.”

Mark Haskell Smith, a novelist who has written about the marijuana industry, agrees. “How else are you going to play eight hours of video games?” he said. He celebrated 4/20 by smoking a joint during a special holiday Pilates class on Zoom.

Mishka Ashbel makes a point of educating his customers about safe smoking during the pandemic. “We’re telling people, ‘Don’t pass the doob around,’ ” he said. One dispensary’s Web site offers a guide for hygienic toking: “Use protection. . . . Bong condoms slip right into the top of a bong so you don’t have to put your mouth where someone else’s was.” Another thing to watch out for, Ashbel noted: “You might end up eating all of your quarantine food supplies.” ♦

"['Isaac Chotiner', 'Isaac Chotine']",2020-05-03,Paul Romer’s Case for Nationwide Coronavirus Testing,"One of the biggest questions every country faces is how to reopen businesses without causing a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Paul Romer, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who has served as the chief economist at the World Bank, has been putting forward plans to mitigate the economic fallout from the coronavirus and to allow for a return of normal economic activity in the U.S. His main proposal is to offer bimonthly tests to every person in the country, allowing more of us to go about our daily lives safely. But testing is still short of where it needs to be, and we may be facing an economic crisis akin to the Great Depression.

I recently spoke by phone with Romer, who is a professor at N.Y.U. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed why Americans may be resistant to digital contact tracing, the need for states to administer tests, and what lessons economists have learned from the crisis.

Over a month ago, you co-wrote an Op-Ed for the New York Times that stated, “To protect our way of life, we need to shift within a couple of months to a targeted approach that limits the spread of the virus but still lets most people go back to work and resume their daily activities.” Are we anywhere close to that approach? And, if not, is our way of life at risk?

We’re not much closer, no. We’ve made very little progress, and I think we are running some risks here. There’s a difference between saying “Here’s something which is likely” and “Here’s something that’s possible, but it’s so bad we have to start preventing it and avoiding that risk right away.” And that’s what I’m trying to say about the possibility that a depression worse than the Great Depression could lead to political turmoil that could do long-lasting damage to the nation. So I think we have to proceed with urgency to try and solve both the health crisis and the economic crisis, and I’m not surprised that we haven’t made a lot of progress yet. But I will tell you that I’m actually encouraged by the decision by Congress to spend twenty-five billion dollars for testing in the phase-three bill. [This allocation is part of Phase 3.5.] That was not what most people were expecting a few weeks ago, and it happened.

What is your biggest fear about the economy right now?

There was some analysis that was done at the St. Louis Fed, going through job categories and just thinking about the employment consequences of physical lockdown and social distancing. Their conclusion was that we were going to be at an unemployment rate above thirty per cent, so that was the early-warning sign that we’re headed for an economic catastrophe that’s worse than the Great Depression.

Different people have talked about different ways to get through this. Your plan focusses on testing more than almost anything else, and more than some of the other plans. Everyone acknowledges that testing is important, but why is it so central to every idea that you’ve put forward?

The key to solving the economic crisis is to reduce the fear that someone will get sick if they go to work or go shop. So it’s really about building confidence. The thing about testing is that it’s easy to explain and it doesn’t frighten people the way digital contact tracing does. It’s not subject to technological and social, political uncertainty the way digital contact tracing is. It doesn’t require the organizational capacity that doing human contact tracing does. It’s really just a very simple, easy-to-explain idea—that to control the pandemic, we need to get a reasonable majority of the people who are infectious into a quarantine, and then we’re good. That’s really all it’s about. So I wanted to try and articulate a very simple approach for managing this crisis, because I think that’s central to restoring confidence.

For example, think about me going back to my dentist. It doesn’t really matter what the law says or the governor says I can do. I don’t want to go back to the dentist’s office in New York City until I know that he can show me a recent negative test, and he doesn’t want me to come into his office until I can show him that I’ve got a recent negative test. So I think it’s easy to explain this idea to people, and I think it’s also easy to convince people that this is something we could do for as long as it takes to manage this pandemic. Suppose it takes more than twenty-four months to get to a vaccine. If it takes more than twenty-four months, I could see going and getting tested before I go to the dentist and the dentist could get tested. Neither of us has a problem with that.

I really think that confidence is so central to investment decisions, to planning, to anticipating the future, that we need something so simple that nobody worries if it’s going to work, nobody worries if we’re going to abandon it because it’s too painful. Everybody just says, “O.K., yep, that’s the plan. We’re going to stick to it.” And then we go.

Some of the other plans that have come out have dealt more with things like contract tracing and digital surveillance. Is your critique of this approach that you yourself are worried about privacy issues, or is it more that you think that politics or that those plans will be concerning to citizens, which will then impair our ability to put them into effect and get the economic growth back where we want?

I’m not worried about the privacy issues, because it’s kind of, like, “Compared to what?” I think we’ve got enormous problems with surveillance right now. This doesn’t seem to me to make it much worse. But I was participating in digital discussions about response to the crisis, and the meeting would go like this: “We need more testing.” Financial people said, “Yep, we got it.” “We need masks and protective equipment.” “Yep, fine.” “And then we need to have the digital contact tracing.” And then, all of a sudden, the whole meeting is taken up with hand-wringing and anxiety and all kinds of fears. Every time somebody said “digital contact tracing,” it became a target. So I just don’t see how you get something done with the kind of speed we need right now when it raises so many concerns among so many people.

Testing has sped up but is still not where it needs to be. Shouldn’t the government be willing to do basically anything, including spending any amount of money, to amp up testing, because the money it spends will be a rounding error in the budget compared to the economy coming back?

I think I share your puzzlement about why that doesn’t just end the discussion. And some people ask, “Well, what do you as an economist have, what’s your business poking into an issue that should be the domain of the epidemiologists?” And my answer is, “Listen, you need the perspective of economics to say that, right now, this depression is costing us, in an order of magnitude, back-of-the-envelope, five hundred billion dollars per month. So, if we can come up with a solution that costs us like eight to ten billion a month, we’re way ahead. And so don’t worry about whether we can afford to do the testing compared to the alternative. We can obviously afford it. Let’s just see if we can agree to testing at that level, then provide the kind of safety we need, and that we can communicate to everybody how this works and why it will work.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/paul-romer-on-how-to-survive-the-chaos-of-the-coronavirus

"['Rachel Syme', 'Rachel Sym', 'Sean Laver', 'Alexandra Schwart']",2020-05-05,“This Is What Happens to Couples Under Stress”: An Interview with Esther Perel,"Relationships are hard, even when we are not in the midst of a global pandemic. Nobody knows this more intimately than the Belgian psychotherapist and author Esther Perel, whose hit podcast, “Where Should We Begin?” allows listeners to play fly on the wall as she conducts actual couples’ therapy sessions. Perel is also the author of the best-selling books “Mating in Captivity,” about sex within monogamous relationships, and “The State of Affairs,” about navigating infidelity. In late March, as countries across the globe were enacting social-distancing measures, she launched a special podcast series called “Couples Under Lockdown.” In the series so far, Perel has done therapy sessions with couples in Italy, Belgium, and New York City, counselling them through the challenges of this very anxious, and often exasperating, time. “If we want to look at the challenges of communication, of sexuality, of desire, of conflict in relationships, this is such a Petri-dish moment,” Perel told me recently over Zoom. During our conversation, which has been edited and condensed, we spoke about how to fight with your partner during quarantine, how to go on dates from home, what to do if your partner’s habits are driving you insane, and how to maintain a sense of self when you can’t escape each other.

I saw your husband just walk through the room. Are you together in the house?

We are together, yes. (laughs)

How’s that going?

You know, right now we are both working, doing psychotherapy. We are in our own professional worlds and then we come together, at different times throughout the day, and have a lot to share. I think what helps a lot is that both of us feel like we’re doing something quite meaningful at the moment, with what we know, what we have practiced. We are physically removed, but we are professionally and psychologically very, very close to what’s going on and, therefore, to each other as well.

I was thinking the other day about one of your first books, “Mating in Captivity.” With what we’re going through now, the captivity has become quite literal.

“Mating in Captivity: The Quarantine Edition.”

You’ve often pointed out that too much is expected of modern relationships: your partner is supposed to be your best friend and your lover and your psychotherapist and your child-care co-worker and, you know, your dishwasher. Everything. And those roles, historically, used to be spread out within communal structures. And it seems like this pandemic has only magnified the degree to which we’re forced to rely on our partners.

I think that, really, what is essential at this moment, especially when we have just one person to give us what an entire village should be providing, is that we create boundaries, routines, and rituals. There needs to be, as best as possible, a separation between daytime and evening, week time and weekend, working time and idle time, family time and individual time, moments that are task oriented and moments where we stop for a bit. When we’re going to eat, are we going to reset the table or just push our work stuff away a little bit so that we have room to put a plate down? I think that, more than ever, the routine that creates a structure, that brings a certain sense of order in a world that feels so chaotic and so unsure, is crucial. The ritual is what separates the ordinary and the mundane from something that becomes more elevated, more separated, more sacred. All of these three things are essential.

Some of my friends have commented that being at home with their partners has made some of the “invisible work” they do, which their partners took for granted, quite visible. For example, they’re, like, “Who did you think cleans the house and does the dishes? Suddenly, you see all that that I’m doing.” Or, vice versa, maybe someone says, “You have finally seen what I do at work. And you see how hard I work. And you’re not acknowledging it.” What effect does that have, to have these things suddenly visible in a new way?

What is happening now, in this expanded view of ourselves and of our partners, can go in two directions. In one direction, you say, “I’m curious. Tell me more. I never knew. I really appreciate it. I realize how clueless I was, how I let you do everything.” And it becomes really a source of connection. In the other version, it becomes a source of blame: “You want me to tell you how much I’ve been doing? I just did the laundry! I just cleaned the sinks! You would just live in a pigsty! What’s the matter with you?” You begin to complain in such a way that insures that the other person is going to try to chew you out as fast as possible, and you’re not going to get the help.

This brings me to the question of how people should fight. Couples are going to get into arguments and log jams during this time. But you literally can’t walk away. I’m wondering how you are seeing couples work through things when they cannot physically separate.

You don’t need to have a door to leave the house. You can be somewhere there without being absolutely present. I think that couples, by definition, go through harmony, disharmony, and repair. This is a dance that we do no matter what. By definition, we fight. What matters is how you fight. When you get really mad at something, can you afterward say, “O.K., got that out of my system—how are we going to solve this?” or “Look, I realize I was quite unfair. Let me first say what I do appreciate about what you do before I dump on you the whole list of stuff that I don’t think you do.” That’s why I play this little exercise of ten yeses and ten nos, which my colleague Dan Siegel taught me. It’s so powerful. Because if you start with the yes, you will fight differently. You will actually have a different argument. You can diffuse it with humor.

Begin by saying to yourself, “What are the one or two things that they have done that I can appreciate?” Otherwise, it’s whatever is negative I will highlight, and whatever is positive I will take for granted. If we made it on time, it’s because there was no traffic, and, if we got there late, it’s because of you. The negative is attributed to the other person, and the positive is just taken as “that’s the way it should be.”

And you can be all entitled about this and say, “Well, there’s no reason I should appreciate that, because I have done a whole bunch of things, and you haven’t appreciated them either.” But the productive thing is to start with you. You want to change the other? You change you.

What else can you say about how to fight better?

Stay focussed on the task. When you want to talk about the dishes, don’t end up talking about five different things, two of which are years old. Don’t “kitchen-sink” it. Keep yourself to the one thing that you’re upset about at this moment.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/this-is-what-happens-to-couples-under-stress-an-interview-with-esther-perel
"['Casey Cep', 'Casey Ce', 'Zoey Pol', 'Susan B. Glasse']",2020-05-02,We Can’t Afford to Lose the Postal Service,"I am probably one of the least consequential things my mother has ever delivered. She has two other daughters, for starters—one’s a public servant and the other is a special-education teacher. But she’s also spent her working life delivering love letters, college acceptances, medications, mortgage papers, divorce filings, gold bars, headstones, ashes, and care packages. In her thirty-eight years as a rural letter carrier with the United States Postal Service, she’s delivered just about everything you can legally send through the mail.

For twenty-seven of those years, she’s driven the same fifty miles five or six days every week, starting out at the post office and tracing Rural Route 5, bringing letters and packages to her five hundred and forty-five customers. Her best advice from all that driving is to carry duct tape, which can fix anything, and can even be made into a leash if you happen to find a lost dog. Her best day, she says, was a few years ago, when a retirement community got added to her route—a hundred and fifty-seven new customers, with stories and the time to tell them. The retirement home comes early in her fifty miles, but some days she stops again on her way home for longer visits, or heads back there on weekends for birthdays and anniversaries or to welcome someone home from the hospital.

My mother is so close with so many of the people who live along her route that they have always felt like second or third cousins to me—people I knew I was related to even if I didn’t see them very often. Mr. R. sent books home with her for me to read; the E. family pulled her jeep out of a snow drift and towed her back to the post office when her brakes failed; the F. family lost two children when their house burned down; Mrs. M. baked her bread and gave her iced tea in a to-go cup; the B. family had some landscaping work they wanted my father to do—and on and on through the years, a litany of routine or unexpected celebrations and tragedies and kindnesses. In the course of almost four decades, my mother has watched babies she saw come home from the hospital grow into adults who mail their parents Christmas letters with photographs of their own children, wondered whether a husband or wife or neither will stay in their house after a marriage ended, and seen grandchildren take over wheat farms from their grandparents.

Being a rural letter carrier suits my mother, and it enabled her to provide for a family like ours: it is a union job, with protections and benefits, insurance and vacation days, only modest raises but occasional overtime and reliable, transparent wages. It isn’t all wonderful; I was an adult before I noticed that the official vehicles she and her fellow-carriers drive do not have air-conditioning, and that her joints are already arthritic, her knees busted, her shoulders and back chronically sore, her gait wobbled by the wear and tear caused by hefting fifty-pound packages of dog food and forty-pound boxes of cat litter that are supposedly cheaper on Amazon than they are at the local store. Still, it is a better job than she thought she would ever have, and it allowed her to keep us in braces, allergy shots, X-rays, books, clothes, and movies. Eventually, it got her credit good enough to get us savings accounts and credit cards and loans.

My father, who is older and had been working longer than my mother had, was a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers; my mother joined the National Rural Letter Carriers’ union as soon as she was eligible. They knew that whatever they hoped for their children, they themselves would always be labor, not management. So we were a union family: my parents spent a few nights a year at local meetings, and if we went on vacation it was to wherever the annual union convention was held that year—usually the beach near where we lived, in Maryland, although one year we drove all the way to Maine. While we three watched the miracle that was cable television or played mini-golf with Dad, my mother put on her Sunday best and spent her days doing what I later learned a lot of other people’s parents did all the time: attend meetings. To me, my mother suddenly seemed like an executive.

Unions are the most powerful advocate people like my parents have. That power is one of the reasons that, although the U.S.P.S. is by far the most popular government agency, it is the one most often threatened with extinction. My mother is about to retire, and I worry that the agency she has spent her life serving will be retired soon, too. The coronavirus, which has decimated the global economy, has not spared the Postal Service—and while shipping and package volume are on the rise, standard and bulk mail have plummeted, leaving the U.S.P.S. with increasing deficits. But if the coronavirus kills the Postal Service, its death will have been hastened, as so many deaths are right now, by an underlying condition: for the past forty years, Republicans have been seeking to starve, strangle, and sabotage it, hoping to privatize one of the oldest and most important public goods in American history.

Before they declared their independence, the American colonists decided that they needed a better way to communicate with one another. In the summer of 1775, at the Second Continental Congress, they created the Postal Service and named Benjamin Franklin its first Postmaster General. Where before letters or packages had to be carried between inns and taverns or directly from house to house, now there was a way for Americans to safely, discreetly, and reliably correspond across long distances. After the Revolution, when Congress ratified the Articles of Confederation, legislators included the Post Office in the ninth of those articles, and later enshrined it in the first article of the Constitution.

The Founders saw the Postal Service as an essential vehicle for other rights, especially the freedom of the press: one of the first postal laws set a special discounted rate for newspapers. But they also understood that a national post unifies a nation, allowing its citizens to stay connected and connecting them with their federal government. When Alexis de Tocqueville toured the young country several decades after its founding, he travelled partly by mail coach, noting in “Democracy in America” how “the mail, that great link between minds, today penetrates into the heart of the wilderness.”

But the mail didn’t just follow American settlers into the wilderness—it also led to the transformation of the frontier. The constitutional authority that created the Postal Service allowed for the construction of post roads to link faraway cities; eventually, these ran all the way from Florida to Maine. A few of those essential byways survive, some of them obvious in their names, like the Old Albany Post Road and the Boston Post Road. Later, that authority was interpreted more broadly to justify federal investment in railroads and highways. During its long history, the Postal Service has delivered the mail by pony express, mule train, float planes, ferry boats, motorcycles, skis, hovercrafts, and pneumatic tubes. There were only seventy-five post offices at the nation’s founding, but by the time the Civil War started there were more than twenty-eight thousand spread around the country.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/we-cant-afford-to-lose-the-postal-service
"['Evan Osnos', 'Evan Osno', 'Jane Maye', 'George Saunder']",2020-05-05,How Greenwich Republicans Learned to Love Trump,"How did America’s country-club Republicans, the cultural descendants of Prescott Bush, learn to love Donald Trump? They don’t have much in common with the clichéd image of his admirers: anxious about losing status to minorities, resentful of imperious élites, and marooned in places where life expectancy has fallen. But the full picture has never been that simple. As early as May, 2016, exit polls and other data showed that Trump supporters earned an average of seventy-two thousand dollars a year, while supporters of Hillary Clinton earned eleven thousand dollars less. Two-thirds of Trump’s supporters had incomes higher than the national median—sometimes, as in Greenwich, much higher.

Shopping Cartoon by Roz Chast

I grew up in Greenwich, on Round Hill Road, not far from the club where Prescott Bush stormed out of the locker room. My great-grandparents Albert and Linda Sherer moved to town from Chicago in 1937. Albert was a Republican who worked in advertising for the National Biscuit Company, and Linda raised their two children. They were renters until 1968, when they bought a white Colonial with a wide lawn. The house passed down through the generations, and, when I was nine years old, my parents moved the family from Brooklyn to Greenwich, into a world of uncountable advantages. In 1994, I graduated from Greenwich High School, which is the rare public school that has a championship water-polo team and an electron microscope. (It was a donation, obtained by an award-winning science teacher.)

People around town have never much cared for caricatures of the place—the starchy patricians, the chinless wonders, the history of exclusion—even when there is truth in them. For decades, many African-Americans and Jews were prevented from buying homes. In 1975, protesters came to town with signs reading “Cocktail bigots” and “Share the summer,” because Greenwich barred nonresidents from a public beach—a restriction that lasted until the state Supreme Court overturned it, in 2001. Nobody pretends that bigotry has vanished, but these days the town has more diversity than outsiders expect. Thirty-eight per cent of its public-school students are minorities, mostly Latino; in some elementary schools, at least half the students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Many of their parents work in local service jobs, bearing high rents and expenses in order to access some of the country’s best public schools. Frank Farricker, a real-estate developer and a Democratic activist, said, “I tell everybody that Greenwich only discriminates on the basis of one color: green.”

The seacoast of Fairfield County has always been one of America’s most affluent places, but in recent decades it has sprinted ahead of the rest of the country. In 2016, according to federal estimates, it was the wealthiest metropolitan area in the United States, outstripping the oil country of Midland, Texas, and the technology hub of San Francisco. Even though a string of tycoons have fled Connecticut in search of lower taxes, the latest Forbes ranking of the world’s billionaires lists fifteen of them in the “Greater Greenwich Area,” led by Ray Dalio, the founder of the hedge fund Bridgewater, who is worth an estimated eighteen billion dollars.

From afar, it is easy to misread the politics of the place: like much of America’s coasts, the Gold Coast has swung left, culturally and politically, since the days of Prescott Bush. The largest share of voters in Greenwich today are unaffiliated; Republicans still hold an edge over Democrats, but the margin is less than four thousand registered voters. In 2016, nobody was surprised that Clinton beat Trump in Greenwich, fifty-seven per cent to thirty-nine. But that portrait—of liberal cosmopolitans appalled by Trump—obscures a potent element of American politics: the executive class of the Republican Party. Its members are wealthier, more conservative, and more politically active than their forebears, in ways that have helped Trump reach the White House, survive impeachment, and fortify his bid for reëlection during the anguish of the coronavirus pandemic. Understanding how he retains the overwhelming support of Republicans requires an accounting of not only what he promised Americans at the bottom but also what he provides Americans at the top.

The story of Trump’s rise is often told as a hostile takeover. In truth, it is something closer to a joint venture, in which members of America’s élite accepted the terms of Trumpism as the price of power. Long before anyone imagined that Trump might become President, a generation of unwitting patrons paved the way for him. From Greenwich and places like it, they launched a set of financial, philanthropic, and political projects that have changed American ideas about government, taxes, and the legitimacy of the liberal state.

The former congressman Christopher Shays is a moderate Republican who was elected eleven times to represent the Gold Coast, from 1987 to 2009. Now conservatives mock him as a RINO—a Republican in name only. “When Sean Hannity calls someone like me a RINO, I want to punch him in the nose,” Shays told me. “I got elected as a Republican for thirty-four effing years, and Hannity has never gotten elected for anything.” When Shays talks to former staff and constituents in Connecticut, he has come to recognize the delicate language of accommodation: “I was talking to a guy I know well, after some pathetic thing that Trump did, and his response was ‘Yes, but he’s selecting the right Supreme Court Justices.’ I started to laugh at him, because I know for a fact that’s a minor issue for him.” Shays believes that many Americans quietly share Trump’s desire to reduce immigration and cut social-welfare programs for the poor. “He’s saying what people think, and they appreciate that,” Shays said. “But not many are going to admit that’s why they support him.”

When it comes to the essential question—will Trump get reëlected?—the answer rests heavily on a persistent mystery: how many Americans plan to vote for him but wouldn’t say so to a pollster? In Greenwich, Edward Dadakis, a corporate insurance broker who has been involved with Republican politics for fifty years, told me that many of his friends are “below the radar screen.” He went on, “In a sense, I’m one of them. I’m out there in the public domain, so people know where I stand, but in 2016, for the first election ever, I did not put a bumper sticker on my car.” He worries how strangers will react. He said, “I still have two ‘Make America Great Again’ hats at home, wrapped in plastic.”

The southern panhandle of Connecticut is cradled between the gray-blue waters of Long Island Sound and the wooded border of New York State. In politics and in culture, it’s a mashup of New England and New York, a place settled by Puritans who agonized over what the historian Missy Wolfe calls “the proper balance between their flock’s economic success and the level of success that they deemed would offend God.” Long after the Puritans were gone, the tension remained in a seesawing battle between the Brahmin and the buccaneer, service and profit, restraint and greed. For much of the twentieth century, the Brahmin had the advantage.

In 1927, Owen D. Young, a Greenwich resident who was the first chairman of General Electric, gave a speech at Harvard Business School, in which he scolded businessmen who “devise ways and means to squeeze out of labor its last ounce of effort and last penny of compensation.” He encouraged them instead to “think in terms of human beings—one group of human beings who put their capital in, and another group who put their lives and labor in a common enterprise for mutual advantage.” Rick Wartzman, a longtime head of the Drucker Institute and a historian of corporate behavior, told me, “This really was beyond rhetoric. We were much more of a ‘we’ culture than an ‘I’ culture.” On Young’s watch, G.E. became one of the first American companies to give workers a pension, profit-sharing, life insurance, medical coverage, loans, and housing assistance.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/how-greenwich-republicans-learned-to-love-trump
"['Helen Rosner', 'Helen Rosne']",2020-03-26,"Helen, Help Me: Is a Ramp Grown on My Windowsill Still a Ramp?","If you have quarantine-cooking questions for Helen, send them to themail@newyorker.com with the subject line “Helen, Help Me.”

My wife, we just discovered, is pregnant. Meanwhile, there are five pounds of rib-eye steaks in our freezer. With searing to medium rare no longer an option, I am thoroughly confused. I thought perhaps sous vide, but don’t know what temperature or timing would qualify as safe. I entertained some sort of braise, but it feels like a waste of prime beef. What should I do? —Luke M., Queens, New York

I revere a gorgeously marbled rib-eye as much as the next ethically conflicted carnivore, but I do sometimes marvel at how the American predilection for steak—i.e., a big, honkin’ slab of beef—has blinded us to all the other ways those same edible parts of the cow can be put to use. Thaw your rib eye almost all the way (or, if it’s not currently frozen, pop it in the freezer for about twenty minutes) and use a very sharp knife to slice it thinly across the grain—there, you’ve got the backbone of a gorgeous stir-fry. Or shave it even more thinly (take your time, with both the knife sharpening and the meat shaving) and make yourself some sweet-spicy Korean bulgogi, or a Chicago-style Italian beef sandwich, a Sichuan hot pot, a Philly cheesesteak, or tacos enchilados, where thinly sliced meat (usually pork, but, hey, use beef!) is marinated in a spicy paste of chiles and herbs and then seared in a hot pan to a state of crispy, meaty, fiery euphoria, and served atop warm tortillas—a perfect meal to celebrate your impending parenthood!

Can you regrow ramps from their bulbs like you can with scallions and leeks? Technically, if a ramp is a wild leek, and what I’m growing is cultivated and no longer wild, is it still a ramp? —Annmarie P., Brooklyn, New York

From a practical perspective, yes, you can plop the bulb end of a ramp in a glass of water and it will re-sprout, at least a little bit. I have a few cut ramps regrowing right now, lined up next to my stoutly regrowing scallions and some re-shooting green garlic in my windowsill victory garden. As for the second part of your question, which is one of category, I’ll brush the dust off my inner Bertrand Russell and tackle this like the proper logic puzzle it is. Let’s start off with some premises:

R (ramps exist)

R → V (if something is a ramp, it’s a vegetable)

V → (W ⩒ C) (all vegetables are either wild or cultivated, but not both)

R → W (if it’s a ramp, it must be wild)

We can thus interstitially conclude that:

C → ~R (if a vegetable is cultivated, it’s not a ramp)

But we can also take somewhat axiomatically the following:

G (you’re growing vegetables in a cup of water set in your kitchen window)

G → C (if a vegetable is grown in a cup of water set in your kitchen window, it’s cultivated)

And, of course:

V ⊃ ~S (if something is a vegetable, it will not spontaneously transform into a different kind of vegetable upon being regrown in a cup of water set in your kitchen window)

Q.E.D.: G → ~R; whatever you’re growing isn’t ramps.

This is either a bold proof of the fact that ramps are not ramps, or else compelling evidence that, at least in matters culinary, certain applications of mathematical logic are largely useless. If you happen to have any liquid plant food lying around, try adding a drop to the cup of water, both to speed growth and to add a little robustness to the flavor of your ramps, or zombie ramps, or non-ramps, or whatever the hell they are.

I live in Lisbon, Portugal. Around this time every year, passionfruit descends into our frutarias from far-flung nooks of the Lusophone world. The first time I cut into a passionfruit—and inhaled it—was exactly four years ago, on the seaside road of Timor-Leste’s capital, Dili. Every year since, I would buy one, slice it open over the quiet of my kitchen sink, and take it in straight from the shell: the oyster of fruit. I’ve now gone back to my Bulgarian roots, worshipping at the altar of my pantry for survival, each ingredient picked because it can present a seemingly infinite number of possibilities. Passionfruit, consumed thousands of miles away from its native land, is suddenly revealed as a single-use delight, unfit for a time of mass hunger; a metaphor for the rot at the core of our global food system. So, I humbly ask, what should one do with this year’s crop—nay, what should we think of it? Eat it because it’s here, freeze it for better days, or reject it as I hope we reject our destructive ways? —Petya K., Lisbon

This is the great ethical question of all consumption, isn’t it? On one hand, what’s done is done—the passionfruit has already been shipped across the world, the cow has already been slaughtered, the thousand-year-old sequoia has already been chopped down. On the other hand, what’s done begets more doing. If we let the passionfruit go uneaten, in protest of the harm it causes, will the harm have all been imposed for nothing? If we consume it, to temper that harm with a dose of pleasure, are we simply creating more demand—more future harm? There’s no single answer; it varies by scope, by place, by person, by need, by thing. Some measure of destruction is inevitable: we should strive to tread lightly in our lives, but it’s impossible not to tread at all. Still, that’s no excuse for recklessness. One passionfruit is a time machine of memory, ten are a fruit-bowl frivolity, a thousand might be a bloodstain. It’s right there in the poem that is your question: make decisions that feel important, enact them at a scale that feels meaningful, and try to slurp from them every golden drop. If you do have room in your freezer for a few passionfruit, you might as well save one or two for later.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/kitchen-notes/helen-help-me-is-a-ramp-grown-on-my-windowsill-still-a-ramp
"['David Quammen', 'David Quamme', 'Karl Taro Greenfel', 'Carolyn Korman']",2020-05-05,Why Weren’t We Ready for the Coronavirus?,"In 2006, the idea that an unknown virus might spill out of some wild animal into humans, achieving person-to-person transmission and causing a global pandemic, seemed a distant prospect to most people. As an engaging science-fiction scare, it ranked somewhere beneath “Alien: Resurrection.” But Ali S. Khan, of the National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases, was tasked with dreaming that nightmare by daylight.

NCZVED (pronounced “N. C. Zved,” according to Khan), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resided in an unobtrusive gray brick building, behind locked gates and locked doors in the C.D.C.’s compound on Clifton Road, six miles northeast of downtown Atlanta. During a two-day visit that year, I worked my way along the NCZVED corridors, interviewing scientists who knew all about Ebola viruses (yes, there are more than one) and their lethal cousin Marburg; about West Nile virus in the Bronx and Sin Nombre virus in Arizona; about simian foamy virus in Bali, which is carried by temple monkeys that crawl over tourists, and monkeypox, which reached Illinois in giant Gambian rats sold as pets; about Junin virus in Argentina and Machupo virus in Bolivia; about Lassa virus in West Africa, Nipah virus in Malaysia, Hendra virus in Australia, and rabies everywhere. All these viruses are zoonotic, meaning that they can pass from animals to people. Most of them, once in a human body, cause mayhem. Some of them also transmit well among people, bursting into local outbreaks that may kill hundreds. They are new to science and to human immune systems; they emerge unpredictably and are difficult to treat; and they can be especially dangerous, as reflected in the name of the branch within NCZVED that studied them—Special Pathogens. For these reasons, some scientists and public-health experts, including Ali Khan, find the viruses an irresistible challenge. “It’s because they keep you on your toes,” he told me. On the second day of my visit, amid the intriguingly gruesome briefings, Khan took me out for sushi.

Khan is a medical doctor by training, an epidemiologist by career, and a man of candid, irreverent jocularity. He was wearing an epauletted uniform sweater; at the time, he was also an officer in the United States Public Health Service, which is organized into ranks, like those in the U.S. Navy. “You’ve heard all the talk from our people,” he said. “Which of these diseases is your favorite?”

My favorite? Ebola is pretty damn interesting, I told him.

“Aaah,” Khan said dismissively. “I like Ebola as much as the next person.” He had done crucial epidemiological work during the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, in what was then Zaire, organizing control measures, investigating transmission, tracing the outbreak back to its Patient Zero, risking his life to help end a juggernaut of misery and death. He continued, “But, for my money, SARS was the one.”

SARS? I knew of it only as a bad viral disease that, in 2003, came out of southern China and killed people in Toronto, Singapore, and a few other cities. The acronym stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome.” It’s an ugly illness that can lead to lethal pneumonia. A little more than eight thousand people were infected, of whom about ten per cent died, and then the outbreak ended. “Why SARS?” I asked.

“Because it was so contagious, and so lethal,” he said. “And we were very lucky to stop it.” SARS was the bullet that went whistling past humanity’s ear. This was on our lunch break, I had stopped taking notes, and it was fourteen years ago, so I can’t swear that Khan mentioned the other thing that is most relevant about SARS: It was caused by a novel coronavirus.

Ali Khan is now the dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in Omaha. He seems an unlikely Omahan: born and raised in Brooklyn, by Pakistani immigrant parents, he went to Brooklyn College, followed by SUNY Downstate (in Brooklyn) for medical school. “And then I did this crazy thing of leaving Brooklyn”—crazy to his family, “because I have uncles and aunts who have never yet left Brooklyn to go to the city.” His father, Gulab Deen Khan, was a self-made man of the epic sort: as a teen-age peasant farmer, he trekked from Kashmir to Bombay, lied about his age, and got work on a ship, greasing engines. His friends called him Dini, as a diminutive, because he was small. After moving to the U.S., Dini Khan stoked coal in boilers to heat apartment buildings in Brooklyn until he had saved enough to buy an apartment building himself. He made money—what seemed a fortune. Before he lost it, in another speculation, Dini Khan decided that his young son, Ali, should learn about his family’s culture, religion, and language. He sent Ali back to Pakistan for middle and high school. By parental miscalculation, he chose a classic British boarding school in Lahore, a better place to learn cricket than Urdu or Islam. Ali Khan, now fifty-six years old, told me this story, punctuated with laughs, when I reached him recently by Skype. His dark hair and beard had grayed a bit, but he still looked fit and sounded jovial. He spoke of Omaha like a pitchman for the Chamber of Commerce: great city, safe, unpretentious ethos, full of billionaires, such as Warren Buffett, who live in their old family homes, drive their little Buicks, and write million-dollar checks to the community.

“I love being a dean,” he said. “It’s so much fun.” He went to Omaha in 2014, leaving the directorship of the C.D.C.’s Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, which included overseeing the Strategic National Stockpile of emergency medical supplies, supervising eight hundred employees, helping assemble a national biodefense strategy against pandemic threats, and much else. “The end of my career at C.D.C., I managed a $1.5-billion budget, so it was people and money.” He had travelled the world on outbreak responses, from Wyoming to Bangladesh. During a mission to southern Chile, investigating a hantavirus outbreak, he visited remote villages, sometimes on horseback, trapping rodents to determine which species carried the virus. “We learned quickly that there were a lot of rodents,” he said. After he worked on Rift Valley fever in Saudi Arabia, in 2001, the Saudi Minister of Health gave him a Lucite replica of a beheading sword as a token of gratitude. At one dicey moment in central Zaire, during an outbreak of monkeypox, he and his team got word that two sets of combatants in the raging civil war—Laurent Kabila’s guerrillas and the opposing forces of President Mobutu—were coming. “They’ll likely take your vehicles and gear,” an American Embassy contact advised by satellite telephone. “But they probably won’t kill you.” Khan’s group packed fast and vamoosed on a small airplane, which rose straight into a thrashing thunderstorm. “The guy on my left was praying,” Khan recounted in a book, “The Next Pandemic,” full of colorful field adventures and serious warnings, published in 2016. “I looked over and saw that the French physician sitting next to me was writing a farewell note to his family. Which got me thinking.” His thought: This is a risky profession, and the work has to be worth a person’s life. For more than two decades at the C.D.C., it evidently was. In 1995, he did that hitch in Kikwit, Zaire, for Ebola. The following year, he went to the Sultanate of Oman to help with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Uganda, in 2001, for Ebola again. SARS, in Singapore, in 2003. Chad was still struggling to eliminate polio in 2008, and Khan went there.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/why-werent-we-ready-for-the-coronavirus#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_92847201-ea5a-44d7-a75e-3d6abb512054_popular4-1

"['Louisa Thomas', 'Louisa Thoma']",2020-05-05,The U.S. Soccer Team Is Still Fighting for Equal Treatment,"The United States Women’s National Soccer Team had not lost in so long that you could be forgiven for forgetting that they could. They have won the last two World Cups, and four of the eight Women’s World Cups ever played. During their most recent World Cup run, they never trailed; even when the score was tight, the outcome did not seem in doubt—such was their skill and their collective determination. At some point in the past decade—perhaps during the 2015 World Cup final, when Carli Lloyd hammered the ball from midfield over the Japanese goalkeeper’s head and into the net, and certainly by the time Megan Rapinoe stood with her arms outstretched, the goddess of victory, after scoring a goal against France, four years later—winning seemed to become an integral, irrevocable aspect of who they were. “We are such a proud and strong and defiant group of women,” Rapinoe said after the team’s World Cup championship last year. “We’ve done exactly what we’ve set out to do, what we wanted to do. Getting to play at the highest level at the World Cup is ridiculous, but, to be able to couple that with everything off the field, and to back up all of those words with performances and back up those performances with words—it’s just incredible. I feel like this team is in the midst of changing the world around us.”

If the team had a rival, it was not on the field, where no one could touch them. It was with their own federation, U.S. Soccer, which for years had underpaid and undervalued them, the women believed. A year ago, just months before the start of the World Cup, the women filed a gender-discrimination suit against U.S. Soccer, alleging that the federation paid them less and treated them worse than the men’s national team—even though the women were, by many metrics, more popular, and by any measure more successful. The federation countered by noting that the women were paid under a different structure than the men, according to the rules of a collective-bargaining agreement that the women had agreed to—and also that, during the past five years, the women have been paid more, in aggregate and on average, than the men. The women countered by pointing out that they had played more and succeeded more, which earned them bonuses: while the women were winning two World Cups, the men failed to qualify for theirs entirely.

When the U.S. women’s team clinched the championship in Lyon, France, in front of sixty thousand people, the crowd erupted in chants of “Equal pay! Equal pay!” An estimated two hundred and sixty million people were watching the match on television. At a ticker-tape parade in New York, a few days later, the same cheer resounded. The team’s sponsors ran commercials extolling not only the players but their cause. Presidential candidates praised them. The players were more than a team, it appeared; they were a movement, and the movement seemed inexorable.

The federation fought back. On March 9th, about a year after the players filed their suit, lawyers for U.S. Soccer argued in legal filings that the pay disparity between the men and the women was justified by the women’s relative lack of athleticism. “Indisputable science” proved that the women were inferior to the men, the argument ran. The lawyers insisted that the job of a men’s-national-team player “carries more responsibility within U.S. Soccer than the job of [a women’s-national-team] player,” and that being a member of the men’s team “requires a higher level of skill based on speed and strength.”

Two days later, the U.S. women’s team played Japan, in the final of the SheBelieves Cup. The women emerged onto the field with their training shirts inside out, hiding the U.S. Soccer shield, but leaving visible the four stars representing four World Cup titles. Seven minutes into the game, Rapinoe coolly scored off a free kick, on a laser-like shot just under the crossbar. Twenty minutes after that, Christen Press spun around the ball at the top of the penalty area, and, in the same motion, lofted a shot that floated high over the keeper’s head, dropping delicately into the left corner of the goal. In the eighty-third minute came a dagger from Lindsey Horan. The U.S. women won, 3–1, extending their unbeaten streak to thirty-one consecutive games.

After the game, Rapinoe spoke about the arguments that U.S. Soccer had made days before, in court. “To see that blatant misogyny and sexism as the argument used against us is really disappointing,” she said. Sponsors of U.S. Soccer, including Coca-Cola, Volkswagen, Budweiser, Visa, and Deloitte, had all blasted the federation. The men’s team, who were in the midst of renegotiating their own collective-bargaining agreement, had already made a lengthy statement in support of the women. (“In our estimation, the women were due at least triple what our expired deal was worth in player compensation,” it read. “We believe the Federation should have agreed to a deal directly tied to a fair share of the revenue players generate.”) Carlos Cordeiro, the president of U.S. Soccer, apologized, pleaded ignorance, and announced that new lawyers would be hired. Soon after that, he resigned.

Then the sports world came to a halt. The players, like most people, went home and stayed there. The trial, originally set for May 5th, was pushed back. As life changed in previously unimaginable ways, the women were left waiting to make history. And then, on Friday, May 1st, federal Judge R. Gary Klausner, ruling in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Pasadena, rejected the plaintiffs’ argument and sided with U.S. Soccer, which had insisted that the women’s claim of unequal pay due to gender discrimination should be dismissed. (He allowed a more narrow claim of unequal treatment, related to travel, training, and medical staff, to go forward; the trial is scheduled to begin June 16th.) The truly unthinkable had happened: the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team lost.

Whatever the public might have believed, winning the lawsuit was never a sure thing. If the men’s team had simply qualified for their World Cup, they would have earned more than the women during the past five years. But they didn’t, and so the women have in fact made more money than the men. It is also true that the men and women negotiated substantially different collective-bargaining agreements: the men, under theirs, were paid for individual performances, in a pay-for-play model. The women had rejected a similar structure, opting instead for more security, with negotiated salaries, maternity and child-care benefits, and severance pay for when players were cut. The court found that the women could not retroactively object to having agreed to an inferior arrangement.

Of course, the women did not agree to lower bonuses in favor of more security because they believed it was sure to pay them more but because they didn’t have much of a choice. Men’s professional soccer is the world’s most popular sport; many of the players on the U.S. men’s team make hundreds of thousands, and even millions, playing for their club teams. They could afford the riskier pay structure for the national team. When the women were negotiating their agreement, the very future of women’s professional soccer seemed fragile; for some players in the National Women’s Soccer League, pay was low enough that they worked second jobs. They needed insurance because they weren’t sure to get it elsewhere.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-us-soccer-team-is-still-fighting-for-equal-treatment

"['Vinson Cunningham', 'Vinson Cunningha', 'Hilton Al']",2020-05-05,Lorraine Hansberry’s Roving Global Vision,"Since early April, when the great literary critic and English professor Cheryl A. Wall died, I have been thinking about the last book she published, “On Freedom and the Will to Adorn,” about the African-American essay tradition. Wall was one of the foremost scholars and interpreters of the work of Zora Neale Hurston, and, in “On Freedom,” Wall latches on to Hurston’s assertion that the “will to adorn”—a tendency toward linguistic flourish, even under duress—is an important aspect of “Negro expression.” Wall believed that the black essay has often fulfilled two barely extricable purposes: to argue for political, economic, social, racial, and sexual liberation, and to satisfy a writer’s urge for self-expression through aesthetics.

Wall’s insight goes beyond the essay; it’s more like an unveiling of the impulses—sometimes harmonious, sometimes dissonant—that come together to make art of any kind that is anchored in place and time but can also move past those parameters. There may be no better example of this capacity in the modern American theatre than the life and art of the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, who died in 1965, at the age of thirty-four, but left behind enough genius for lovers of literature to follow like a trail of generous crumbs. (May 19th will mark the ninetieth anniversary of Hansberry’s birth.)

Even before her sparkling career as a playwright began, Hansberry walked a political-artistic tightrope, making personal and creative adjustments in order to achieve the kind of balance that Wall describes. In her early twenties, having just arrived in New York from the Midwest, she published poems in radical journals; worked as a journalist for Freedom, a black leftist newspaper published by the actor and singer Paul Robeson; and studied with W. E. B. Du Bois, at the Jefferson School of Social Science. She was beginning to hone her lifelong leftward politics into a roving, endlessly empathetic global vision.

Around that time—according to “Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry,” Imani Perry’s intimate, ruminative book, from 2018, more documentary portrait than strict biography—Hansberry sent a letter to her boyfriend, Robert Nemiroff, whom she would later marry. The letter ended with a tellingly determined manifesto:

1. I am a writer. I am going to write.

2. I am going to become a writer.

3. Any real contribution I can make to the movement can only be the result of a disciplined life. I am going to institute discipline in my life.

4. I can paint. I am going to paint.

The END

Hansberry was not only personally ambitious but also hoped to merge her aesthetic and political concerns, which had grown together like a tree with twin trunks—its highest branches intermingled, its sustenance coursing through a mutual system of roots.

Perry’s book is an elegant, softly subjective rereading of the facts of Hansberry’s life. If Hansberry’s own story is a kind of drama, Perry is her most perceptive, unabashedly biased critic, helping to reiterate and build on her themes, and to make her performance live again. “Looking for Lorraine” tunnels deep into Hansberry’s psyche, showing how the dissonance of her youth yielded a poised artist, cut down too early by illness. Hansberry had a relatively bourgeois, liberal, middle-class upbringing, in Chicago, but it was ringed by violence. When her father, a real-estate entrepreneur, bought a house in a white neighborhood, the family was greeted with a cement block thrown through their front window; it just missed Lorraine’s head, and lodged itself into a wall.

If Perry has one persistent obsession, it is how, after this harrowing moment, Hansberry struggled to synthesize her attraction to politics, her deeply felt humanism, and her native interest in beauty: how she learned to move from helpless frustration to a contemplation of the earth’s magnificence in one mental stroke. “There were her politics, centered on the poor, the marginal, the oppressed and outsiders,” Perry writes, “and there was her grasping at the interior life.”

In 1959, Hansberry had an astounding success, with “A Raisin in the Sun,” becoming the first black woman to have a play début on Broadway. The plot centers on a Chicago family’s complications in moving to an all-white neighborhood. It satisfied every requirement of a “well made” domestic drama, setting its characters’ generational, religious, and political divisions so artfully against one another that the eventual climax—Walter Younger’s loss of his family inheritance—feels like a glimpse beyond setting and character and into the country’s future of commingled hopes and desires.

After “Raisin” ’s run, Hansberry wrote a post-apocalyptic fantasy called “What Use Are Flowers?” She conceived it as a television special, but decided to make it a play instead. Parts of it have been adapted for radio and staged readings, and some of its text was used in “To Be Young, Gifted and Black,” the posthumous play that was edited by Nemiroff. To read “Flowers” now—alongside other post-“Raisin” works, such as “Les Blancs” and “The Drinking Gourd,” all of which, along with “Flowers,” are collected in a book called “Les Blancs: The Collected Last Plays of Lorraine Hansberry,” from 1972—is to be reminded that, for Hansberry, “Raisin” was a beginning, not an end. The theatre, with its urge to make the interior visible, and to force contradictions through the refiner’s fire of confrontation, was a perfect vehicle for her to develop both her politics and her art.

“Flowers” begins in a bleak landscape, empty except for a group of scantily clothed kids. They are prelingual, and look hungry. It’s unclear what has happened to civilization, but the clear reference—given the time, and Hansberry’s global political concerns—is to the bomb. Hansberry had watched Du Bois, her mentor and a family friend, get arrested and indicted after starting a petition against nuclear weapons. He was ostracized in polite circles, both black and white, and was labelled a Soviet agent.

Hansberry’s admiration for Du Bois was total. In a journal entry, she called him “freedom’s passion, refined and organized.” That formulation sounds like an eerie anticipation of Wall’s: Du Bois’s 1903 book, “The Souls of Black Folk,” in which he brought together social science, reportage, music criticism, and even fiction, is a cornerstone of the black essay tradition. He had used his peerless education, personal fastidiousness, and artistic flair as a conduit for his passions, not an excuse to dampen them in the name of respectability. He had paved a road that Hansberry hoped to travel.

In “Flowers,” the kids kill an animal and fight over the body. Nobody coöperates; it’s a microcosm of Hobbes’s “war of all against all.” A struggle ensues, and, Hansberry notes in her stage directions, “those who are strongest triumph.” Apocalypse has exposed human ruthlessness and set it loose as the highest law.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/lorraine-hansberrys-roving-global-vision
"['Amy Davidson Sorkin', 'Amy Davidson Sorki', 'Sheelah Kolhatka', 'Charles Bethe']",2020-05-05,The Rush to Reopen,"Illustration by João Fazenda

The fatal confusion of the United States’ response to the coronavirus crisis is now moving to a more disjointed stage: the rush to reopen. Last week, as statewide stay-at-home orders began to expire, governors from Alabama to Missouri softened or declined to extend them. The new measures are a hodgepodge: Texas is allowing movie theatres to reopen, with some limits, but not gyms. Georgia allows both—and massage and tattoo parlors. Some of the steps seem influenced less by epidemiology than by industry lobbies and excessive attention paid to scattered protests. (Polls show that most Americans support closures.) The Attorney General, William Barr, has told prosecutors to look for and take action against “overbearing” restrictions. President Trump, who has left reopening decisions to the states, offering only loose guidelines, does not seem especially worried that moving too quickly might lead to more waves of death from COVID-19. “If there’s a fire, we’re going to put it out,” he said, on Wednesday. The danger is that reopening will become an act of mass arson.

A key point of closures and social distancing was to slow the spread—to flatten the curve—so that the first wave of the pandemic would not overwhelm the health-care system. Those actions bought time to prepare hospitals, develop treatments, and get closer to a vaccine. Perhaps above all, time was needed to make widespread testing available, and to follow it up with contact tracing. As much as President Trump has claimed otherwise, that effort has hardly begun. Texas has tested only about one per cent of its population, and cases are not yet declining there in a sustained way. In Indiana and Minnesota, which are pushing to reopen, cases are rising. Even New York, which is testing more people than many countries, doesn’t seem to have the tests it needs to provide an accurate death toll. More than five thousand presumed COVID victims in New York City have been excluded from the state tally because they were never tested, complicating attempts to assess the disease’s trajectory.

Still, given the heavy social burdens of the closures, some states are drawing up more cautious, calibrated plans. Governor Andrew Cuomo, of New York, has said that he intends to allow hospitals in some upstate counties, which have been less hard hit, to resume performing elective procedures—a category that includes many cancer surgeries. He also has committed New York to work in concert with six other Northeastern states, so that they do not end up undercutting one another’s efforts. California, Oregon, and Washington have formed a similar partnership. Reopening is, in fact, a matter not of relaxation but of vigilance. Governor Gavin Newsom, of California, has begun talking about opening schools in July, to make up for lost days, but he also closed the state’s beaches, after crowds of people flocked to them.

Some who argue for reopening sooner rather than later say that doing so will allow for a “controlled spread” of the disease, in which more people can develop a resistance and the population as a whole can achieve “herd immunity.” One problem with this approach is the projected number of hospitalizations and deaths along the way, which is very high. Another is that the idea assumes that those who have had COVID-19 will, indeed, be immune. But, as the World Health Organization recently warned, it isn’t yet clear how effective or enduring any immunity might be. There are viruses, such as measles, for which the immunity is lifelong; for SARS and MERS, which are coronaviruses, immunity seems to fade, on average, in a couple of years. For the four other known human coronaviruses, which cause varieties of the common cold, immunity lasts just months.

Meanwhile, the F.D.A. has allowed companies to market a grab bag of serological tests, meant to detect a prior infection, even though they tend to give high rates of false positives, possibly mistaking antibodies that a person has acquired from fighting off a cold for the remnants of a battle with COVID-19. That is a shaky basis on which, say, to send a health worker back into a nursing home. Without coherent, stringent standards, the field of serological testing will remain in a hazardous state, threatening a cruel replay of the disastrous problems with diagnostic testing.

The discussion around reopening often draws a distinction between “the vulnerable” and everybody else, as if our strength were not defined by our willingness to stand together. Reading Texas’s reopening plan, one would think that only the elderly are vulnerable. Yet one of the risk factors for death from COVID-19 is obesity, which affects a third of the adults in the South and the Midwest. And diabetes is a major factor in the many deaths of people who are relatively young. There is a misperception, too, that only cities are susceptible, in spite of the fact that some rural areas have been devastated. The most dangerous illusion one can have in a pandemic is that it is only happening to other people, someplace else.

The absurdity of some of the reopening measures—tattoo parlors?—raises the possibility that the public may be reluctant to follow the governors’ lead. Businesses may decide to stay closed or to keep their employees working from home. People may decide not to go to restaurants or malls or to take public transportation. But those with fewer financial resources may not have the luxury to choose safer ways of living. Last week, officials in Iowa and Nebraska made it clear that anyone who declines to go back to work will risk losing unemployment benefits. Many low-wage workers—in grocery stores, hospitals, and the meatpacking plants that Trump has ordered to stay open, even as they have become centers of outbreaks—have never stopped showing up. Moreover, as the COVID Tracking Project noted, in South Dakota, a state that is almost ninety per cent white, people of color account for close to seventy per cent of the confirmed cases—a reflection of the demographics of meatpackers, and of wider disparities.

Reopening should be something other than a lopsided reapportionment of risk. Nor can it rely on wishful thinking or luck. It requires hard, deliberate work, with clear prerequisites: testing, contact tracing, leadership, mask-wearing, individual discipline, and a willingness, if cases spike, to change course. It can be done, but we have to get it right. ♦

"['Katherine Dunn', 'Katherine Dun', 'Tony Earle', 'Deborah Treisma']",2020-05-05,The Resident Poet,"At his request, I am hiding in the parking lot. Every time lights show on the road, I jump behind a tree or crouch beside one of the cold parked cars. I don’t really care whether I’m seen or not, but I do plan to emerge mysteriously when he drives up. Impress him with my discretion, my knowledge of the surreptitious. But the rain is ruining the effect. I’m beginning to get angry. Who does he think would see us? Or care? I consider going back to my room and making a sign to hold up at passing cars: “I AM WAITING TO SCREW MR. LUCAS, THE RESIDENT POET!”

My mascara is running into the pouches beneath my eyes. I can feel the thin mud of powder on my forehead and cheeks beginning to slide.

The lights from the dormitories and the dining hall glow on the hill. No shapes around them, only blackness, and the moonless dark on me and around me. Another car turns off the main road. I stand behind a tree until it disappears up the long driveway to the college. I forgot to ask what kind of car he drives.

The spy game palls. I huddle under the tree and wish myself back in bed with a book and an inexhaustible supply of cigarettes. The image of my cozy self in a soft puddle of smoky lamplight grieves me.

I could have picked a less paranoid professor. But would that professor have picked me? Fortunately, the resident poet feels duty bound to fondle the freshmen, and I’m the only dope so far who has been susceptible to his paunch and poetry. And he’s the only dope susceptible to me. Unless he chickens out and I’m left soaking all night. If he’s not here when the moon comes up, I decide, I’m going in.

Light from the road, turning. A puttering of syncopated pistons. An old Volkswagen gasping and shaking into the lot. The headlights beam in odd directions, and eyeglasses shine through the dim windshield. I slide out from under the tree and squelch suavely toward the car. His face, gray and anxious, dips a smile at me. I get in on the passenger side, bringing the wetness in with me. Slam the door. He wheels the car around and rips out of the lot, down the driveway, and onto the road without looking at me.

When I first met him, I thought he looked like Ulysses S. Grant. All that curly black hair and curly black beard, the thick pink lips and square forehead. The more I see of him, the truer the resemblance seems. The light from the street lamps is slashed by the rain and ripples over his face. The spreading veins across his cheeks, the odd pits in the skin of his nose, the watery blue eyes, the secret weakness of his chin. He crops his beard so that it juts, instead of sliding toward his Adam’s apple along with his chin. His worries are bunched in lumps all over his forehead. At a stoplight, he gives me a quick, constipated grin.

“Nobody saw you?” His face turns back to the street, but I can see his eyes sliding at me in jerks, waiting for my answer.

“Only the fire department and your wife’s mother.”

His chuckle is a long time coming. His pudgy knuckles are pale green in the moving light.

“Would you mind crouching down in your seat until we get out of town?”

His apologetic teeth. The rasp in my breath. I drop onto the floor and prop my chin on the seat. Try to keep my wet boots from touching my ass. There are strange drafts down here, whispering through the framework, jets of cold squirting me in the back and the hair.

He looks very large. His stodgy shoes pump and move over the pedals at the end of his reliable wool legs. The gray cloth swags over his belly, droops from his arms.

“Do you think I’m crazy?” he says.

His fat lips. The pleading eyes. He’d rather be home in bed with his soft wife and a bottle of beer. I tip my head so that he can see my smile in the dark beneath the dashboard.

“Of course, you’re a lunatic.”

He is pleased. It’s so important to be crazy if you’re a poet. He reaches into his breast pocket. “I got something for you.”

A package of little cigars.

“Don’t these bother you? Your asthma? I wasn’t going to smoke at all.” I have prepared to be vicious for two days.

“No. I don’t mind cigar smoke. I can smoke these myself. It’s just cigarettes that make me choke.”

In his class, we sit with all the windows open, the rain blowing in. We don’t take off our coats. He always wears the same suit. It looks as though he’s stored potatoes in the pockets for a few seasons. The same plaid flannel shirts over improbable layers of underwear, or maybe that softness is his flesh welling up beneath the cloth. The clashing plaid tie is always just enough askew to allow his wiry chest hair to peep through at the collar.

“Have you eaten dinner? I haven’t. How about a hamburger?”

“Great!” I chirp.

Throw a few volts into the smile, a few more than usual, actually, because of the dark beneath the dashboard. The car wheezes to a stop. He removes the key and looks around, his eyes reflecting light. Then he smiles down at me and slips out. He leans in for a moment before swinging the door closed.

“Keep hidden just a little while longer. A lot of the students come here.”

His anxious face is gone with a flash of spectacles. I lift my head above the level of the window and watch his broken-butt trot across the shining tar. The big neon mouth on the sign prepares to chomp down on a seductively plump olive with an obscenely oriented pimento. He’s left me at the dark end of the parking area. Am I really going to wallow and stroke and gurgle and sigh over this character? Yes. What dull stuff I get into for the sake of excitement. I can see him through the café window as he casts furtive glances at the ragtag collection of customers, muttering his order at the waitress so that no potential blackmailers or squealers can hear him ask for two coffees and two hamburgers and two orders of French fries.

By the time he gets back to the car, I’m giggling. He hands me the lidded coffees. I balance them above the seat as he pulls out.

“I’m sorry about all this. You can get up now.”

My ass is numb and my legs ache. The chill has penetrated to my kidneys and set off a reaction. I pull myself onto the seat and open the coffee. Rest the cups on the gyrating dash. Rip open the hot, greasy paper around the food.

“I hope you like onions.”

“What did you tell your wife?”

Hand him a hamburger, smear a capsule of ketchup on the potatoes. He chomps and chews. “A weekend conference with a publisher.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/the-resident-poet

Experts predicted that Wednesday, April 15th, would be a peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, its epicenter. On that day, a crew of New Yorker writers talked with people all over the city, in many circumstances and walks of life, to form a portrait of a city in crisis. A group station manager for the subway talks about keeping the transit system running for people who rely on it; a respiratory therapist copes with break-time conversations about death and dying; a graduating class of medical students get up the courage to confront the worst crisis in generations; and a new mother talks about giving birth on a day marked by tragedy for so many families. The hour includes contributions from writers including William Finnegan, Helen Rosner, Jia Tolentino, Kelefa Sanneh, and Adam Gopnik, who says, “One never knows whether to applaud the human insistence on continuing with some form of normal life, or look aghast at the human insistence on continuing with some form of normal life. That’s the mystery of the pandemic.”

"['Nathan Heller', 'Nathan Helle', 'Charles Duhig', 'Ian Frazie']",2019-07-29 ,Was the Automotive Era a Terrible Mistake?,"The summer I was eighteen, I visited a parking lot forty-five minutes north of town and got behind the wheel for what I hoped would be the first real rite of my adulthood. I was tall, gangly, excitable. Less than a week earlier, following a brief stretch of test-taking at the Department of Motor Vehicles in San Francisco, I had received my learner’s permit. Learning in those days seemed easy. Tests were easy. Doing—when the matter arose at all—was hard. Behind the wheel, I made a show of adjusting the mirrors, as if preparing for a ten-mile journey in reverse. I surveyed the blank pavement ahead of me and slowly slid the gear-shift from park into drive.

Cars had been my first passion. As a two-year-old, I’d learned to recognize the make of vehicles by the logo near the fender or perched on the hood. I grew to understand the people in my life according to their cars; I learned what sort of person I was from my parents’ two old Hondas, one of which, a used beige Accord, I had gone with them to buy. My father’s lingering bachelor vehicle, a rotting yellow Civic, needed to be choked awake on dewy mornings, and I’d performed that job with relish, pulling out the knob beside the steering wheel, waiting a long moment, and pushing it back. This was the late eighties. Gas prices had fallen, and the roads were knotty with cars from across the world. I no longer remember what, as a small child, I envisaged for my future, but I know that it involved moving at speed behind the wheel.

Now, all those years later, the parking lot was virtually empty of cars, and I felt a flush of reassurance. I was learning in my parents’ highly defatigable ride, a minivan with an all-plastic interior and the turning radius of a dump truck. My teacher was my father, a flawless but not wholly valiant driver, who habitually refused to drive on certain bridges in certain directions, for fear of being, as he would put it, “hypnotized” by trusses passing alongside the road. For reasons lost to time, my little sister was on board, too, in the back. I eased my foot onto the gas; the engine revved for a moment, and the van lurched.

For the first time, I felt the seething power of the thing—not as a conveyance, which is how I had known cars in the past, but as a huge appetitive machine that interacted with the world through its own strength and expressed urges I did not. I was, I realized with a start, embarrassed at the wheel. It felt like being observed during a first attempt at slow dancing; my impulse almost at once was to use the brake. I did, and now it was my father and my sister who lurched.

“Oh, my God,” my sister said.

“Maybe a little bit gentler,” my father noted, sounding oddly placid, maybe hypnotized.

I tried again for forward motion, this time travelling what felt to me like a great distance at great speed. A few parked cars that had seemed safely remote drew very close. I braked again and surveyed my progress over my left shoulder. I’d achieved a commute of about ten feet.

Until then, despite having been in cars all my life, I’d failed to recognize the ease with which an errant movement, the equivalent of knocking into someone on a crowded bus, could bring about an injury or a death. As I jolted around the lot, I imagined myself on the road, in traffic, and felt a tight spasm of panic in my chest. I was eighteen. It had been all I could manage to remain on top of my un-botchable after-school job watering the neighbors’ bonsai trees. By the end of day, the idea of not driving—of not entering a future in which, day to day, I’d risk becoming an accidental killer of children—seemed freeing and bright. I never had a second lesson.

For years, I counted this inability to drive as one of many personal failures. More recently, I’ve wondered whether I performed an accidental kindness for the world. I am one of those Darth Vader pedestrians who loudly tailgate couples moving slowly up the sidewalk, and I’m sure that I would be a twit behind the wheel. Perhaps I was protected from a bad move by my own incompetence—one of those mercies which the universe often bestows on the young (who rarely appreciate the gift). In America today, there are more cars than drivers. Yet our investment in these vehicles has yielded dubious returns. Since 1899, more than 3.6 million people have died in traffic accidents in the United States, and more than eighty million have been injured; pedestrian fatalities have risen in the past few years. The road has emerged as the setting for our most violent illustrations of systemic racism, combustion engines have helped create a climate crisis, and the quest for oil has led our soldiers into war.

Every technology has costs, but lately we’ve had reason to question even cars’ putative benefits. Free men and women on the open road have turned out to be such disastrous drivers that carmakers are developing computers to replace them. When the people of the future look back at our century of auto life, will they regard it as a useful stage of forward motion or as a wrong turn? Is it possible that, a hundred years from now, the age of gassing up and driving will be seen as just a cul-de-sac in transportation history, a trip we never should have taken?

Among the captivating books to land on my desk recently was Dan Albert’s “Are We There Yet?: The American Automobile Past, Present, and Driverless,” which notes that, in the late nineteenth century, electric cars and gasoline cars developed side by side. One assumes that electrics were only notionally in the running at this stage. Surprisingly, Albert reports, gas cars were the B-fleet for years.

Turn-of-the-century electric cars were more maneuverable than their gasoline-powered counterparts. They had faster acceleration, better braking, and powerful torque, which compensated for the heft of their batteries. They set land-speed records—in 1902, an electric car briefly attained an astonishing hundred and two miles per hour—and, unlike internal-combustion vehicles, didn’t sputter out in traffic and need to be cranked up in the middle of the road. True, they had to be recharged every forty miles or so, about the distance from Mount Vernon to Grand Central Terminal and back, but few early motorists were travelling much farther. Electrical power was the moon shot of its age, quiet, futuristic, and the vanguard of human accomplishment. When Albert A. Pope, the head of the Columbia bicycle company, entered the car business, in 1896, he invested in electrics. “You can’t get people to sit over an explosion,” he explained.

Pope declared bankruptcy in 1907. Why did finicky, explosive gas cars win the field? Albert is a car guy by passion and vocation, a former curator of vehicle collections at the Science Museum in London. Today, he identifies himself as “n+1’s car critic,” an assignment that he clearly prosecutes with seriousness and pride. His book is interesting and idiosyncratic, occasionally at the same time, and tracks cars’ changing social and cultural position with an elegiac tone. “The road was once an open-ended adventure, full of wrong turns and serendipitous discoveries,” Albert writes. “Now the phone knows every mile and every minute before we leave the garage.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/was-the-automotive-era-a-terrible-mistake
"['Jonathan Zittrain', 'Jonathan Zittrai', 'Allison J. Pug', 'Kelly Clanc', 'Tad Frien']",2020-05-05,The Hidden Costs of Automated Thinking,"Like many medications, the wakefulness drug modafinil, which is marketed under the trade name Provigil, comes with a small, tightly folded paper pamphlet. For the most part, its contents—lists of instructions and precautions, a diagram of the drug’s molecular structure—make for anodyne reading. The subsection called “Mechanism of Action,” however, contains a sentence that might induce sleeplessness by itself: “The mechanism(s) through which modafinil promotes wakefulness is unknown.”

Provigil isn’t uniquely mysterious. Many drugs receive regulatory approval, and are widely prescribed, even though no one knows exactly how they work. This mystery is built into the process of drug discovery, which often proceeds by trial and error. Each year, any number of new substances are tested in cultured cells or animals; the best and safest of those are tried out in people. In some cases, the success of a drug promptly inspires new research that ends up explaining how it works—but not always. Aspirin was discovered in 1897, and yet no one convincingly explained how it worked until 1995. The same phenomenon exists elsewhere in medicine. Deep-brain stimulation involves the implantation of electrodes in the brains of people who suffer from specific movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease; it’s been in widespread use for more than twenty years, and some think it should be employed for other purposes, including general cognitive enhancement. No one can say how it works.

This approach to discovery—answers first, explanations later—accrues what I call intellectual debt. It’s possible to discover what works without knowing why it works, and then to put that insight to use immediately, assuming that the underlying mechanism will be figured out later. In some cases, we pay off this intellectual debt quickly. But, in others, we let it compound, relying, for decades, on knowledge that’s not fully known.

In the past, intellectual debt has been confined to a few areas amenable to trial-and-error discovery, such as medicine. But that may be changing, as new techniques in artificial intelligence—specifically, machine learning—increase our collective intellectual credit line. Machine-learning systems work by identifying patterns in oceans of data. Using those patterns, they hazard answers to fuzzy, open-ended questions. Provide a neural network with labelled pictures of cats and other, non-feline objects, and it will learn to distinguish cats from everything else; give it access to medical records, and it can attempt to predict a new hospital patient’s likelihood of dying. And yet, most machine-learning systems don’t uncover causal mechanisms. They are statistical-correlation engines. They can’t explain why they think some patients are more likely to die, because they don’t “think” in any colloquial sense of the word—they only answer. As we begin to integrate their insights into our lives, we will, collectively, begin to rack up more and more intellectual debt.

Theory-free advances in pharmaceuticals show us that, in some cases, intellectual debt can be indispensable. Millions of lives have been saved on the basis of interventions that we fundamentally do not understand, and we are the better for it. Few would refuse to take a life-saving drug—or, for that matter, aspirin—simply because no one knows how it works. But the accrual of intellectual debt has downsides. As drugs with unknown mechanisms of action proliferate, the number of tests required to uncover untoward interactions must scale exponentially. (If the principles by which the drugs worked were understood, bad interactions could be predicted in advance.) In practice, therefore, interactions are discovered after new drugs are on the market, contributing to a cycle in which drugs are introduced, then abandoned, with class-action lawsuits in between. In each individual case, accruing the intellectual debt associated with a new drug may be a reasonable idea. But intellectual debts don’t exist in isolation. Answers without theory, found and deployed in different areas, can complicate one another in unpredictable ways.

Intellectual debt accrued through machine learning features risks beyond the ones created through old-style trial and error. Because most machine-learning models cannot offer reasons for their ongoing judgments, there is no way to tell when they’ve misfired if one doesn’t already have an independent judgment about the answers they provide. Misfires can be rare in a well-trained system. But they can also be triggered intentionally by someone who knows just what kind of data to feed into that system.

Consider image recognition. Ten years ago, computers couldn’t easily identify objects in photos. Today, image search engines, like so many of the systems we interact with on a day-to-day basis, are based on extraordinarily capable machine-learning models. Google’s image search relies on a neural network called Inception. In 2017, M.I.T.’s LabSix—a research group of undergraduate and graduate students—succeeded in altering the pixels of a photograph of a cat so that, although it looked like a cat to human eyes, Inception became 99.99-per-cent sure it had been given a photograph of guacamole. (There was, it calculated, a slim chance that the photograph showed broccoli, or mortar.) Inception, of course, can’t explain what features led it to conclude that a cat is a cat; as a result, there’s no easy way to predict how it might fail when presented with specially crafted or corrupted data. Such a system is likely to have unknown gaps in its accuracy that amount to vulnerabilities for a smart and determined attacker.

As knowledge generated by machine-learning systems is put to use, these kinds of gaps may prove consequential. Health-care A.I.s have been successfully trained to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant. And yet—as a team of researchers from Harvard Medical School and M.I.T. showed, in a paper published this year—they can also be tricked into making inaccurate judgments using the same techniques that turn cats into guacamole. (Among other things, attackers might use these vulnerabilities to commit insurance fraud.) Seduced by the predictive power of such systems, we may stand down the human judges whom they promise to replace. But they will remain susceptible to hijacking—and we will have no easy process for validating the answers they continue to produce.

Could we create a balance sheet for intellectual debt—a system for tracking where and how theoryless knowledge is used? Our accounting could reflect the fact that not all intellectual debt is equally problematic. If an A.I. produces new pizza recipes, it may make sense to shut up and enjoy the pizza; by contrast, when we begin using A.I. to make health predictions and recommendations, we’ll want to be fully informed.

Building and maintaining a society-wide intellectual-debt balance sheet would probably require refining our approach to trade secrets and other intellectual property. In cities, building codes ask building owners to publicly disclose their renovation plans. Similarly, we might explore asking libraries or universities to accept, in escrow, otherwise hidden data sets and algorithms that have found a certain measure of public use. That would allow researchers to begin probing the models and underlying data on which we’re coming to depend, and—by building theories—make payments on our intellectual debt before it becomes due in the form of errors and vulnerabilities.

The growing pervasiveness of machine-learning models, and the fact that anyone can create one, promise to make this process of accounting difficult. But it’s vital. Taken in isolation, oracular answers can generate consistently helpful results. But these systems won’t stay in isolation: as A.I.s gather and ingest the world’s data, they’ll produce data of their own—much of which will be taken up by still other systems. Just as drugs with unknown mechanisms of action sometimes interact, so, too, will debt-laden algorithms.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-hidden-costs-of-automated-thinking
"['Sue Halpern', 'Sue Halper']",2020-05-04,How Cyber Weapons Are Changing the Landscape of Modern Warfare,"In the weeks before two Japanese and Norwegian oil tankers were attacked, on June 13th, in the Gulf of Oman—acts which the United States attributes to Iran—American military strategists were planning a cyberattack on critical parts of that country’s digital infrastructure. According to an officer involved, who asked to remain anonymous, as Iran ramped up its attacks on ships carrying oil through the Persian Gulf—four tankers had been mined in May—and the rhetoric of the national-security adviser, John Bolton, became increasingly bellicose, there was a request from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to “spin up cyber teams.” On June 20th, hours after a Global Hawk surveillance drone, costing more than a hundred million dollars, was destroyed over the Strait of Hormuz by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, the United States launched a cyberattack aimed at disabling Iran’s maritime operations. Then, in a notable departure from previous Administrations’ policies, U.S. government officials, through leaks that appear to have been strategic, alerted the world, in broad terms, to what the Americans had done.

During much of the Obama Administration, the United States’s cyber arsenal was strictly classified. As Michael Hayden, a former director of the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., told the filmmaker Alex Gibney in the documentary “Zero Days,” from 2016, “For the longest time, I was in fear that I actually couldn’t say the phrase ‘computer network attack.’ ” This past September, the Department of Defense issued a strategic plan that not only confirmed the existence of cyber weapons but declared its commitment to using them “to advance U.S. interests” and “defend forward.” The cyberattack on Iran in June was a manifestation of this new, more aggressive approach. (A spokesperson from Cyber Command, the military unit that oversees U.S. digital warfare, said, “As a matter of policy and for operational security, we do not discuss cyberspace operations, planning, or intelligence.”)

At Cyber Command, teams are assigned to specific adversaries—Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China, among them—and spend years working alongside the intelligence community to gain access to digital networks. Cyber weapons are stealth ordnance, written in zeros and ones, like all computer code. They can infiltrate whole networks or infect individual computers. They have the capacity to confuse enemy signals, shut down military attacks before they occur, and stymie communication systems, all without the flash and bang of the typical weapons of war. They rely on software vulnerabilities, poor cyber hygiene, and people who inadvertently open attachments infected with malware. According to Eric Rosenbach, the Pentagon’s cyber czar during the Obama Administration, speaking on the Lawfare podcast, offensive cyber activity is “painstaking work” that involves identifying a platform in another country, gaining access, and then remaining undetected, often for years, inside the system. While the cyberattack on Iranian maritime installations appeared to be an immediate response to the destruction of the drone, it was actually a long time in the making. “We didn’t just press a button,” Herbert Lin, a senior research scholar for cyber policy and security at Stanford, explained. “We’d done lots of work in advance to figure out what targets to hit and to maintain access to them. That happened months and years ago.”

Unlike most physical targets, which are stationary, digital targets are wily and dynamic. “A building is not going anywhere,” Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general, told me. “You have its coördinates. If you decide you’re going to take out that building, it’s fairly easy. But say they just upgraded all the computer systems in that building. You’re going to have to go back to the drawing board if you want to launch a cyberattack.” And, of course, an adversary can simply turn off a computer or shut down a network, taking the target with it.

Last year, the Pentagon gave Cyber Command equal status with the nine other combat commands, which include Central Command and Special Operations Command, an indication of the Internet’s growing importance as both a strategic domain and a military asset. Cyber Command, Spalding said, likely keeps a range of options available at any given time, all of which can be “dusted off” as needed. Until then, he said, “it’s all kind of notional.” That appears to be what happened in the weeks before the drone was shot down. “The boat thing happened, and there was a national-security planning meeting, and they wanted specific courses of action,” the cyber official said. “I mean, those things are already on the shelf, so the question was, Did they want the big enchilada that would inflict a lot of damage, or did they want small ones that would just send a little scare?”

As he described it, planning a cyberattack follows strict military protocol, moving up and down the chain of command as the parameters of an attack are determined, and its benefits and costs are assessed. President Obama had to sign off on all cyberattacks, but in August, 2018, Congress passed a military-authorization bill that allowed some cyberattacks to be authorized by the Secretary of Defense. Around the same time, the Trump Administration issued “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13,” a secret directive which reportedly further eased requirements for Presidential approval in certain cyberattacks. According to Brandon Valeriano, the Donald Bren Chair of Armed Politics at the Marine Corps University, under the old policy, there “was too much concern about authorities and legalities, and, by the time everything was signed off on, it was past the time to operate. The idea is that the new policy allows more leeway to rapidly react as situations evolve.” (Because the directive has not been made public, its specific contents are unknown; members of the House Armed Services Committee have repeatedly demanded a copy of the document, but the White House has thus far refused to release it. The spokesperson said that Cyber Command “does not act without Presidential authorization.”)

While the situation was evolving in the narrow shipping lanes between Iran and Oman, in late spring and early summer, private cybersecurity firms reported that Iranian hackers had stepped up their attacks, including what appears to be a sophisticated influence and disinformation campaign, on American institutions. This was to be expected. In 2011, Stuxnet, the joint American-Israeli cyberattack on an Iranian nuclear facility, disabled thousands of centrifuges. In response, the Iranians quickly mobilized their own technical resources to target at least forty-six U.S. financial institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo with cyberattacks carried out over the course of more than five months. They also infiltrated the operating system of a dam in New York State, in 2013; attacked the servers of a casino owned by the prominent Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, in 2014; and held the city of Atlanta hostage with a ransomware attack, in 2018. “Every single day we’re basically under attack at all levels—not just the military but private citizens, businesses, government, academia—everything,” Spalding, the retired Air Force general, told me. “To prevent adversaries from doing this mercilessly, you have to create a deterrent, and the deterrent is the fear of retaliation.” (Stuxnet—which was widely credited with prompting the seven-country Iran nuclear deal of 2015—has never been officially acknowledged by the United States or Israel.)",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-cyber-weapons-are-changing-the-landscape-of-modern-warfare
"['Dhruv Khullar', 'Dhruv Khulla']",2020-05-05,The Essential Workers Filling New York’s Coronavirus Wards,"The diversity of New York is on full display in its hospital rooms. Some days, I organize my rounds not by where patients are located but by what language they speak: Spanish, Chinese, English, Creole. That way, I can keep the same interpreter on the phone as I make my way from room to room. One in five Americans speaks a language other than English at home; half of New Yorkers do.

One morning, I gown up and step inside a patient’s room, the interpreter on speakerphone in my scrubs pocket. The patient is a deliveryman I admitted earlier that week; his breathing has worsened each day, requiring escalating doses of oxygen via nasal cannula, and now a face mask. I must tell him that, should his breathing worsen further, the next step will be intubation.

I speak carefully, in short paragraphs, pausing to allow the interpreter to translate. The man stares at me from behind his mask, waiting to learn what his future holds. Thirty seconds after I stop talking, as the interpreter completes her translation, his dark eyes widen, and slow recognition spreads across his face.

He asks what intubation entails, and I explain. Again a delay; again the unwelcome news starts to register. He asks how long he’ll remain on the ventilator. We can’t know for sure, I say, but I hope it’s not long. Tears escape his eyes and his breathing quickens. I worry that the conversation itself will tip him into extremis. During the coronavirus pandemic, I’ve avoided entering rooms more than once a day, but today I vow to return.

Outside, I rub foam sanitizer into my hands and remove my face shield. I forget that the interpreter is still on the line.

“Will that be all, doctor?” she says, a minute later, from my pocket.

“Yeah, thank you,” I reply. “That was pretty rough, right?”

“Yes,” she says. “There have been a lot of those conversations lately.”

In New York City, social distancing is working. The virus has claimed at least twelve thousand lives, but single-day deaths have declined steadily since April 7th, when nearly five hundred and sixty people died of COVID-19. New cases and hospitalizations have also fallen in recent weeks, even though many hospitals remain nearly full.

But, as this wave of the coronavirus starts to slow, I can’t help but notice that many of the people still getting infected are those who don’t have the luxury of distance—those who, by necessity or by trade, expose themselves and their families to the virus every day. We’re now debating whether it’s safe to reopen the economy, but for essential workers it never closed. Each morning, during the apex of the deadliest pandemic in a century, these men and women have been venturing out into the epicenter of disease, to cook and clean, deliver food and carry mail, drive buses and stock shelves, patrol the streets and tend to the ill. Many have paid with their health—some with their lives.

It’s becoming clear that essential workers experience a disproportionate share of death and disease owing to COVID-19. During one week not long ago, I cared for a police officer, a grocery-store clerk, and a bus driver. During another, my clinical service of fifteen patients included three food deliverymen. (The last time I can recall caring for a delivery worker was more than two years ago: his leg was broken after he was hit by an S.U.V. at a busy Manhattan intersection.)

The burden falls unevenly among racial and ethnic groups: in New York City, people of color comprise three-quarters of the city’s essential workers. Three-fifths of cleaning workers are Latino; more than forty per cent of public-transit workers are black. Latinos comprise twenty-nine per cent of the city’s population, but thirty-four per cent of all cases; black people are twenty-two per cent of the population but represent twenty-eight per cent of COVID-19 deaths. Many factors contribute. Communities of color have higher rates of poverty, housing instability, and chronic disease. They’re more likely to consist of dense or multigenerational households, in which the virus spreads more easily. These communities have experienced frequent, sometimes egregious, bias from the health-care system, which has engendered lasting mistrust and leads some people to forgo needed care.

In a pandemic, just going to work is risky. “All one has to do is stand on a platform and you’ll see that the trains are filled with black and brown and low-income people going into communities to service those who are able to telecommute,” Eric Adams, Brooklyn’s borough president, recently said. (About a hundred of the city’s public-transit workers have died of COVID-19 since the first M.T.A. worker death was reported, on March 26th.) And yet many essential workers have little choice but to stay on the job during the pandemic—either because they can’t afford to take time off or because they’re told that they aren’t allowed to. One study found that fifty-five per cent of retail and food-service workers, many of whom have been declared essential, have no paid sick leave, and fewer than ten per cent of them can take two weeks off—the recommended COVID-19 quarantine period.

The basic process by which doctors collect a medical history has not changed in a century. You start with a patient’s “chief complaint”—the primary reason for seeking medical care. You make your way through the “history of present illness,” exploring the onset, pace, character, and severity of symptoms. (When exactly did that cough start? What color is your phlegm? Does your chest hurt more when breathing deeply or walking quickly?) Then you move to preëxisting conditions, medications, and allergies.

Tucked somewhere down below is the social history. At its best, the social history is how we explore who patients are as individuals—how their jobs and hobbies and lives intersect with their current predicaments. It’s meant to illuminate how nonmedical factors may have contributed to illness, but also to give us a more complete understanding of what’s important to the person we’re caring for. For busy doctors, though, it’s often reduced to a few mechanical questions: Do you smoke? Drink alcohol? Do drugs? The entire social history in a doctor’s note might read, “No toxic habits.”

It’s turning out that, in this pandemic, social history is profoundly important. As we learn more about the epidemiology of the virus, I find myself exploring these details with great interest. Where do you live? How many rooms? How many people are in those rooms? Does your work require you to come in close contact with others? The answers reveal how much risk specific households and families are shouldering.

One of the many new faces in my hospital belongs to Khalid Haynes, a softspoken African-American man in his mid-twenties. COVID-19 has created administrative demands in addition to clinical ones; Haynes is one of many new patient coördinators who have arrived to keep the hospital running. (Other new hires have been helping to build new I.C.U.s, or transfer patients between facilities.) He began his career as a personal trainer, before starting work as a patient coördinator at an integrative-health clinic. There, he answered phones, greeted patients, and verified insurance; as the coronavirus began to spread across the city, his clinic turned to telemedicine, and he began working remotely. In late March, he received a call from his manager saying that he was being dispatched to the hospital as an essential worker. In his new role, he’d help troubleshoot and distribute iPads to doctors, so that their patients could see their families.

Haynes has kind eyes, horn-rimmed glasses, and an easygoing charm. During our first encounter, I rushed past in a pre-caffeine daze, and he stopped me to ask about my day, insisting on a genuine answer. Two weeks after he started at the hospital, his grandmother died of COVID-19. “That gave me a really painful perspective on how important this role is,” he told me. “I couldn’t see my grandmother before she died. I don’t want that to happen to anyone else.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/the-essential-workers-filling-new-yorks-coronavirus-wards
"['Clifford Marks', 'Clifford Mark', 'Trevor Pou', 'Robin Wrigh', 'Jiayang Fa', 'Atul Gawand']",2020-04-28,What We Don’t Know About the Coronavirus,"COVID-19 has been shown to damage multiple organ systems, including the lungs, the heart, the kidneys, and the brain.

We think of COVID-19 as a disease of the respiratory tract. When future generations look back on this pandemic, its iconic symbol will probably be the ventilator. But, although respiratory problems are at the core of the disease, COVID-19 has revealed itself to be more than a straightforward viral pneumonia. Doctors around the world—including in the emergency department where we work, at Mount Sinai Hospital, in Manhattan—have learned the hard way that the coronavirus doesn’t confine its ravages to the lungs. COVID-19 can push kidneys into failure, send the body’s immune system into catastrophic overdrive, and cause blood clots that impede circulation to the lungs, heart, or brain. It’s a disease of remarkable complexity, which even the most experienced doctors are struggling to understand.

On blogs, podcasts, and #medtwitter, members of the medical community have been trading stories and theories about COVID-19’s intricacies. Often, their conversation has followed the methodology of critical-care doctors. Physicians who work in I.C.U.s tend to talk not about symptoms or diseases—chest pain, diabetes—but about organ systems, which can malfunction and interact in complex ways. System by system, a picture of COVID-19 is emerging. Clarifying it may mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people in the months to come.

The shortness of breath that’s most characteristic of COVID-19 is reasonably well understood. It originates in the gossamer air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, where blood and air are separated by such thin membranes that oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass into and out of the bloodstream, respectively. Between them, the lungs have somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred million alveoli. Severe COVID-19 causes many of them to either collapse or fill with fluid. The virus attacks the cells lining the alveoli; our overactive immune systems, in trying to fight the virus, may be damaging them as well. The result is that not enough oxygen gets into the blood.

Doctors trying to solve this problem have two basic tools at their disposal: oxygen and pressure. They can give patients concentrated oxygen beyond the usual twenty-one per cent that is found in normal air. Alternatively, using a CPAP machine or ventilator, they can create a kind of sustained air pressure within the lungs—“positive end-expiratory pressure,” or PEEP—which keeps the alveoli open, and thus more receptive to oxygen, at moments when the lungs would ordinarily be emptier of air. (Imagine breathing in and out while leaning through the window of a moving car: that lungs-full-of-air feeling is PEEP.) Doctors have also been improving oxygenation by “proning” patients—that is, periodically turning them onto their stomachs. Such positioning takes advantage of gravity to match areas of air-filled lung with areas of higher blood flow.

All this makes straightforward mechanical sense. Still, mysteries hover around the certainties. Doctors track the “oxygen saturation” of patients with COVID-19—they monitor the percentage of hemoglobin molecules in the bloodstream that are currently carrying oxygen. Ordinarily, in patients with healthy lungs, an oxygen-saturation level below ninety per cent is cause for grave concern: when vital organs such as the heart and brain become starved for oxygen, the risk of death skyrockets. But doctors are finding, bizarrely, that some COVID-19 patients can remain subjectively comfortable even when their saturation levels fall far below these ranges. This “silent hypoxemia” is frightening for physicians, who associate such low numbers with imminent death. And it’s deeply mystifying, since the numbers seem implausible.

Is silent hypoxemia a sign that, even though a patient feels relatively well, the bottom is about to drop out? Or is the virus somehow interfering with the blood’s hemoglobin, or with the parts of the brain that warn us when we need more oxygen? Theories abound. Meanwhile, silent hypoxemia complicates the decision to intubate. In the early days of COVID-19 treatment, low oxygen saturation that failed to improve was generally seen as an indication that intubation was necessary right away. But in early March reports of comfortable patients with discordantly low saturation rates began spreading rapidly among doctors online. One particularly arresting image, posted on Twitter by a New York City emergency-medicine physician, shows a patient calmly reading on her phone while her overhead monitor reveals a saturation rate of just fifty-four per cent. Until we better understand the physiology behind silent hypoxemia, and why some people experience it and others do not, we will have no choice but to live with the mystery, scrutinizing some patients who have oxygen levels in the seventies and eighties, and whom we might have rushed to intubate in the past.

Within hours of a viral invasion, the body’s immune system swings into action. The “innate” immune system, which recognizes protein structures common to many pathogens, reacts first, by releasing a family of chemical distress signals called cytokines. They spread from the site of the infection, instructing the body to raise its temperature and divert blood flow to the affected area; they also activate other immune-system cells, which begin developing antibodies specifically targeting the invaders. Without cytokines, the immune system would slumber while infections wreak havoc. But the cytokine system has a weakness. Some pathogens can provoke it in a perverse way, so that it goads the immune system as a whole into overdrive. In what’s known as a cytokine storm, fever and inflammation spike out of control. It’s unclear why some patients might experience this phenomenon while others do not.

Faced with a cytokine storm in a patient, a doctor can try to modulate the immune system’s response. The problem is striking the right balance. While some patients may benefit from a degree of medically induced immunosuppression, there are others for whom such an intervention could cause great harm. Some hospitals have begun cautiously administering steroids or drugs that inhibit the cytokine IL-6. But high-quality clinical-trial data about such treatments won’t be ready for a long time. Moreover, even if early results are encouraging, we will still have to distinguish between those patients who will benefit from immunosuppression and those who won’t. In the past, physicians have interpreted elevated blood levels of the protein ferritin as a sign that a cytokine storm is in progress. Some are now using that analysis in the treatment of COVID-19. Only time will tell if they’re right.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/what-we-dont-know-about-covid-19
"['Sue Halpern', 'Sue Halper', 'Dhruv Khulla']",2020-04-27,Can We Track COVID-19 and Protect Privacy at the Same Time?,"Caroline Buckee, a top epidemiologist at Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health, has devoted her professional life to studying malaria and other infectious diseases. As news of a novel coronavirus emerged from China, Buckee realized that her area of expertise—how infectious diseases evolve as they move through vulnerable populations—would be valuable to health-care workers and elected officials as the virus spread across the globe. “The methods and the tools are the same, and epidemiological models are easily adapted,” Buckee told me. “But, for many of us, like me, we work with endemic pathogens. COVID-19 is new. There is so much we don’t know.” Since the most urgent imperative was to “flatten the curve” of infections, it was crucial to know where public-health strategies like stay-at-home orders were working and where they were not. Buckee quickly assembled a consortium of infectious-disease researchers to make the data accessible to policymakers—data that they did not yet have.

At just about the same time, Ian Allen, a former marine and C.I.A. paramilitary officer, cold-called Harvard’s School of Public Health and asked if there was anything that his new company, Camber Systems, could do to help with the pandemic. Soon afterward, Allen was connected with Buckee, the associate director of the School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. Buckee had created the COVID-19 Mobility Data Network, a network of epidemiologists from universities around the world, to try to track the efficacy of social-distancing measures. Allen agreed to provide Buckee with the software to query and scrub data collected by tech companies and use it to track the coronavirus’s spread without violating Americans’ privacy. “I wasn’t really expecting ever to hear back, assuming that Harvard, of all places, would have all the resources they’d ever need,” Allen told me, while standing in a field in rural Virginia as his son shot at tin cans with a BB gun. (Like many parents, Allen has been homeschooling his children during the pandemic; this was geometry class.) “Caroline asked me if we could help aggregate location data. Just aggregating the data and anonymizing it in the right way to protect privacy would take some of the burden off of her.” Allen reached out to a handful of data firms, including Unacast, Kochava, and X-Mode. All agreed to provide their data for free.

Camber Systems, of which Allen is the C.E.O., is a year-old startup that, among other things, hopes to offer federal, state, and local government agencies ways to use commercially harvested location data to improve their operations without violating privacy laws. Shortly before the pandemic, Allen and his business partner, Navin Vembar, a mathematician who served as the chief technology officer of the General Services Administration, were searching for potential clients, talking with officials in Madison, Wisconsin, about using location data to shore up tourism and distribute the city’s public resources equitably. Assisting Buckee’s COVID-19 Mobility Data Network was the kind of project they envisioned when they launched their company with Hangar, a venture-capital firm that funds companies that use technology in the public interest.

By presenting aggregated location data in an accessible and searchable format for epidemiologists studying COVID-19, the project would enable researchers and policymakers to see how members of the public move around their communities. When paired with other metrics, such as the number of new infections or mortality rates, the data would guide policymakers as they grappled with when and where to lift stay-at-home orders. Facebook is also supplying the network with data. According to Buckee, correspondence between the various groups gives researchers confidence in the trends they are seeing. “One data set is not going to show what’s going on,” she said.

Location data are the bread and butter of “ad tech.” They let marketers know you recently shopped for running shoes, are trying to lose weight, and have an abiding affection for kettle corn. Apps on cell phones emit a constant trail of longitude and latitude readings, making it possible to follow consumers through time and space. Location data are often triangulated with other, seemingly innocuous slivers of personal information—so many, in fact, that a number of data brokers claim to have around five thousand data points on almost every American. It’s a lucrative business—by at least one estimate, the data-brokerage industry is worth two hundred billion dollars. Though the data are often anonymized, a number of studies have shown that they can be easily unmasked to reveal identities—names, addresses, phone numbers, and any number of intimacies. As Buckee knew, public-health surveillance, which serves the community at large, has always bumped up against privacy, which protects the individual. But, in the past, public-health surveillance was typically conducted by contract tracing, with health-care workers privately interviewing individuals to determine their health status and trace their movements. It was labor-intensive, painstaking, memory-dependent work, and, because of that, it was inherently limited in scope and often incomplete or inefficient. (At the start of the pandemic, there were only twenty-two hundred contact tracers in the country.)

Digital technologies, which work at scale, instantly provide detailed information culled from security cameras, license-plate readers, biometric scans, drones, G.P.S. devices, cell-phone towers, Internet searches, and commercial transactions. They can be useful for public-health surveillance in the same way that they facilitate all kinds of spying by governments, businesses, and malign actors. South Korea, which reported its first COVID-19 case a month after the United States, has achieved dramatically lower rates of infection and mortality by tracking citizens with the virus via their phones, car G.P.S. systems, credit-card transactions, and public cameras, in addition to a robust disease-testing program. Israel enlisted Shin Bet, its secret police, to repurpose its terrorist-tracking protocols. China programmed government-installed cameras to point at infected people’s doorways to monitor their movements.

As unlikely as it may seem that such privacy-compromising measures will be adopted in the United States, the Trump Administration reportedly summoned tech executives to the White House to discuss sharing data with the government. Not much is known about the meeting. The Administration has classified all its discussions about COVID-19, and it later denounced Politico for reporting that the White House was in talks with tech firms to create a national coronavirus surveillance system. Last week, Gizmodo reported that Palantir, a secretive data-analytics firm owned by the conservative billionaire and the Trump backer Peter Thiel, has a contract from the Trump Administration to build a database to track the spread of the virus. Palantir is best known for its work with the N.S.A. and ICE, where its software is used to track undocumented immigrants. (Other private surveillance companies, most notably the Israeli firm NSO, are also pitching COVID-19 tracing to governments around the world.)

“We’re all too familiar with the historical record of crises, where new powers in the hands of governments and corporations lead to them holding on to them indefinitely,” Adam Schwartz, a lawyer with the digital-rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. Schwartz pointed out that most of the sweeping investigative powers given to the intelligence community after the 9/11 terrorist attack are still in place nearly two decades later. As Senator Maria Cantwell wrote, on April 9th, in her opening remarks for a paper hearing by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on the role of Big Tech during the pandemic, “Rights and data surrendered temporarily during an emergency can become very difficult to get back.”

As difficult as it is now to look ahead, lawmakers like Cantwell and privacy advocates like Schwartz are asking us to think about how much privacy we are willing to sacrifice to combat a rampaging virus. If we accept government data tracking, the surveillance necessary to curtail COVID-19 could become a permanent fixture in our lives. It’s an unknowable trade-off. “In this particular case, if we have technology for minimizing harm, we have a moral obligation to use it,” Marcello Ienca, a bioethicist at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, told me. “But we have to merge it with the best available technology in the areas of cybersecurity and privacy.” To do this right, Ienca added, the public-health experts need to work with privacy advocates.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-we-track-covid-19-and-protect-privacy-at-the-same-time
"['Sheelah Kolhatkar', 'Sheelah Kolhatka', 'John Cassid', 'Nick Paumgarte']",2020-04-24,How Will We Reopen the Economy After the Coronavirus Crisis?,"The daily coronavirus briefings of Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky, used to be sedate affairs. That changed on April 15th, when protesters began gathering regularly outside the window of his briefing room, in the Capitol building, in Frankfort, and attempting to interrupt the proceedings. “Open up Kentucky!” they chanted. “We want to work!” There were horns, whistles, and signs, including one that said “Quarantine is when you restrict the movement of sick people! Tyranny is when you restrict the movement of healthy people!” An activist stood on the Capitol steps and shouted, “We’re free citizens, and we can’t be told we can’t support our families. We can’t be told that we can’t work. How unethical is it of our leadership to say, ‘No, you can’t work’? It’s garbage! If you want to open your business, go open your damn business!”

Beshear, a Democrat, won the governorship by a little more than five thousand votes last November. On the first day of the protests, he paused his briefing and addressed the people outside the window, trying to appeal to rationality. “Folks, that would kill people. That would absolutely kill people,” he said. “My job isn’t to make the popular decision but to make the right decision, and the decision that saves people’s lives.” As of April 23rd, Kentucky has 3,481 confirmed cases and a hundred and ninety-one deaths from COVID-19, which puts it relatively low on the list of affected states. But Beshear’s dilemma is the same as the one facing leaders across the country. Many Americans, understandably, want to return to work. But reopening the economy would likely accelerate the spread of the virus, straining the health system, causing more deaths, and causing further economic damage. In the coming months, policymakers will be forced to navigate the complicated relationship between protecting people’s health and protecting their livelihoods.

There is no clear path for reopening the economy, and various groups have been issuing their own, competing plans. Last Friday, the governor of Minnesota announced that outdoor activities such as hunting and fishing could resume soon and that golf courses and driving ranges could reopen right away. In Texas, retail stores will be permitted to open back up for curbside shopping. But the governor of Maryland announced that restrictions there would not be lifted until there was greater access to testing, improved hospital space and equipment, and an effective contact-tracing system. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom suggested that people visiting restaurants in his state might have to have their temperatures taken before being allowed inside. On April 13th, President Trump suggested that he might force states to reopen their economies but more recently said that he would leave the question up to governors. The White House also released its own set of guidelines for how to move forward, called “Opening Up America Again.” “I think it’ll be really chaotic,” Dean Baker, the co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told me.

Most experts, regardless of political orientation, agree on a few principles about the recovery. The first is that the longer the economy stays in its current state of shutdown, the longer it will take to get it going again, and the more protracted the economic depression that will follow. “The longer we’re shut down, the more businesses we’re going to lose, and those businesses are what’s going to create the labor demand that will soak up our unemployed workers,” Michael Strain, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute, told me. Baker added, “Some workers won’t be able to come back. There will be incredibly complicated accounting messes; all these bills haven’t been paid for two or three months. Just getting a place up and running again takes time.” The second is that the rescue programs that Congress passed in March could mitigate the damage, but only if implemented effectively, and they still won’t go far enough. (The first stage of the program, intended to help small businesses, has already run out of funds.) The third is that widespread and accessible virus testing and effective infection tracing will be needed before most people will feel confident returning to their pre-pandemic ways of life. (The guidelines released by the White House mention testing but do not address how it would become more widely available.)

Most likely, the economy will come back online through what Strain described as a “staged reopening,” with different sectors switching on at different times. “What would that look like inside a city?” Strain said. “Continuing to prevent really large crowds, maybe opening up the smaller businesses first, having fewer people inside a store at one time. Then maybe you open up the restaurants, but people are spread out.” Larger establishments, such as department stores, would follow, with the time line ideally being driven by what can be determined about the virus’s spread through aggressive testing. It is hoped that the highest-capacity venues, such as stadiums and concert halls, could reopen in the summer. Many governors have pledged to work in regional groups to insure that the transition is as smooth as possible (such plans are already under way: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Delaware recently joined together to coördinate reopening plans.) Strain also noted that even a staged reopening will work only if local leaders can be nimble in response to contagion levels. “If we’re able to do this well, what you should see is pumping the gas pedal and then hitting the brakes,” he said. Schools may reopen in September, for example, and then, if the virus spreads too quickly, close again for two weeks in October. Social-distancing rules in restaurants may have to be continually adjusted. “I think we’re likely to see the virus respond to the level of economic activity, and, if the response is more than we would like, we’re going to need to slow things down again,” he said. “But I don’t know if our system of government is up to that.”

One proposed plan, published by several of Strain’s colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute, outlines the possible phases of a staged reopening. The first is the one we are currently in, when the focus is on slowing the spread of COVID-19 by shutting down public spaces and ordering residents to shelter at home; Phase II occurs on a state-by-state basis, “when they are able to safely diagnose, treat, and isolate COVID-19 cases and their contacts.” During this phase, Scott Gottlieb, an A.E.I. fellow, and his co-authors write, “schools and businesses can reopen, and much of normal life can begin to resume.” Physical-distancing measures may still be in place; vulnerable individuals may still want to limit their contact with others; and much more stringent public-hygiene measures should be adopted in public places. The third phase suggests that physical distancing and other restrictions can be removed when widespread disease tracing, treatment, and vaccines become available. (Vaccine tests are under way, but nothing is expected for at least a year.) After that, the report suggests, we should focus on preparing for the next pandemic. The authors write, “After we successfully defeat COVID-19, we must ensure that America is never again unprepared to face a new infectious disease threat.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/how-will-we-reopen-the-economy-after-the-coronavirus-crisis
"['Dhruv Khullar', 'Dhruv Khulla', 'Alessandra Colaiann']",2020-04-23,The Challenges of Post-COVID-19 Care,"Among the patients I care for at the hospital is a young woman recovering from COVID-19. To keep her blood oxygenated, she needs a device called a non-rebreather mask. The mask is connected by a tube to a one-litre translucent bag, which is in turn connected to an oxygen cannister in the wall; when she exhales, one-way valves shunt expired carbon dioxide into the room and prevent her from rebreathing it. It’s considered an advanced oxygen-delivery device, because it supplies more oxygen than a simple nasal cannula; it is also cumbersome and uncomfortable to wear. But the mask, my patient says, isn’t her biggest problem; neither is her cough or shortness of breath. Her biggest problem is her nightmares. She can’t sleep. When she closes her eyes, she’s scared she won’t wake up. If she does fall asleep, she jolts awake, frenzied and sweating, consumed by a sense of doom. She sees spider-like viruses crawling over her. She sees her friends and family dying. She sees herself intubated in an I.C.U. for the rest of time.

For many people infected with the coronavirus, the disease is mild. Asymptomatic infection is thought to be relatively common; here in New York, most people who need to be hospitalized have been discharged within days. But when the infection is bad, it’s really bad. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, COVID-19 patients who need to go on ventilators generally need them for much longer than people with other respiratory problems. For patients with severe emphysema, the average duration of mechanical ventilation is about three days; for those with other acute respiratory distress syndromes, it’s around eight. At our hospital, most of the COVID-19 patients who have needed ventilators have needed them for weeks. Extubation has been no guarantee of liberation: often, we’ve had to reinsert the tube within days, if not hours.

Prolonged intubation creates all sorts of problems. While patients are intubated, they need powerful sedative medications; many also receive paralyzing drugs to keep their reflexes from fighting the ventilator’s tube. (Some must be physically restrained to prevent them from pulling out catheters and tubes in their delirium.) Patients who survive intubation often find themselves profoundly debilitated. They experience weakness, memory loss, anxiety, depression, and hallucinations, and have difficulty sleeping, walking, and talking. A quarter of them can’t push themselves to a seated position; one-third have symptoms of P.T.S.D. A 2013 study of discharged I.C.U. patients, many of whom had been intubated, found that, three months after leaving the I.C.U., forty per cent of them had cognitive test scores one and a half standard deviations below the mean—roughly equivalent to the effect of a moderate traumatic brain injury. A quarter showed cognitive declines comparable to early Alzheimer’s disease. The longer patients were in the I.C.U., the worse the consequences became.

The joy we all feel when patients at our hospital survive acute COVID-19 is followed, quickly, by the acknowledgment that it could be a long time before they fully recover, if they ever do. Many will suffer through months of rehabilitation in unfamiliar facilities, cared for by masked strangers, unable to receive friends or loved ones. Families who just weeks ago had been happy, healthy, and intact now face the prospect of prolonged separation. Many spouses and children will become caregivers, which comes with its own emotional and physical challenges. Roughly two-thirds of family caregivers show depressive symptoms after a loved one’s stay in the I.C.U. Many continue to struggle years later.

Lindsay Lief, a critical-care physician at my hospital, runs a clinic for patients who have left the I.C.U., including those suffering from what’s known as post-I.C.U. syndrome. Lief got the idea for the clinic years ago, after caring for a forty-year-old woman from New Jersey who developed a serious infection, followed by profound septic shock. In the I.C.U., the woman’s kidneys shut down; she needed dialysis; she couldn’t breathe. She was intubated, extubated, intubated, extubated. When, after weeks of treatment, she was finally in stable condition, Lief began thinking about what it would be like for her to leave the hospital and return home. “This lady had such a traumatic I.C.U. course,” she said. “And I’m going to send her back to Jersey with no support—just a few papers about what we did? That seemed crazy.”

When Lief started the clinic, she saw patients by herself, most several weeks out from discharge. Lief would walk them through what had happened in the hospital—for many, it was a blur. She’d screen them for depression, anxiety, and P.T.S.D., and assess how they were managing at home. Were they gaining back the weight they’d lost in the I.C.U.? Had their sleep improved? She’d run through the medications they were taking and stop the ones that were no longer needed. Over time, she added psychologists, therapists, nutritionists, pharmacists, and social workers to her team.

“We try to offer holistic, whole-person care,” Lief told me. “Sometimes patients have already seen twenty doctors. They’ve had their scars, lungs, and eyeballs examined, but no one has asked, ‘How are you doing with all this?’ ” Patients, she learned, feel frustrated by their dependence on others. They can’t return to work; they’re forced to take taxis because they can’t climb the subway stairs. Others have trouble paying bills and keeping track of medical appointments. “Often, what these patients need is not a doctor,” Lief said. “They need physical therapy, occupational therapy, social interaction, case managers, financial planners. They need people to help them get their lives back.”

To contend with the flood of patients who will be extubated in the coming weeks, we’re planning to create a COVID-19 survivors unit—essentially an in-patient version of Lief’s outpatient clinic. The unit will bring together clinicians from various backgrounds: hospitalists, pulmonologists, rehab specialists, psychiatrists, dieticians, therapists. It will develop COVID-19-specific protocols, which we hope will help patients progress to a fuller recovery. Patients will receive daily “pulmonary rehab”—a stepwise approach to reducing oxygen support and slowly building strength and endurance. They’ll learn breathing techniques and get help with gadgets they can use to clear mucus from the lungs. Some will be shown how to cough better. Physical and occupational therapists will help them recover motor skills that may have diminished during their hospitalizations; psychiatrists and nutritionists will help with mood and food. Many patients, because they are too sick, or need oxygen, or because no rehab facility will accept them, will need to spend days or weeks recovering in the hospital. “The best thing we can do is create a home-like environment,” Lief told me. “The whole point is to help them stop being patients and start feeling human again.”

We tend to think of extubation as the point when a patient begins breathing independently. But, in fact, it’s possible to be extubated while still depending on a ventilator to breathe. If the thick intubation tube—inserted into the mouth, pushed through the vocal cords, and resting in the lungs—is left in too long, it can damage surrounding tissue; when that time comes, doctors make a small hole in the front of the neck, just below the thyroid gland, and insert a thin tracheostomy tube directly into the windpipe. This tube allows for a permanent connection to a ventilator. The patient has been extubated, but is no closer to his pre-coronavirus life.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/the-challenges-of-post-covid-19-care
"['Siddhartha Mukherjee', 'Siddhartha Mukherje', 'Jerome Groopma']",2019-07-22 ,The Promise and Price of Cellular Therapies,"It matters that the first patients were identical twins. Nancy and Barbara Lowry were six years old, dark-eyed and dark-haired, with eyebrow-skimming bangs. Sometime in the spring of 1960, Nancy fell ill. Her blood counts began to fall; her pediatricians noted that she was anemic. A biopsy revealed that she had a condition called aplastic anemia, a form of bone-marrow failure.

The marrow produces blood cells, which need regular replenishing, and Nancy’s was rapidly shutting down. The origins of this illness are often mysterious, but in its typical form the spaces where young blood cells are supposed to be formed gradually fill up with globules of white fat. Barbara, just as mysteriously, was completely healthy.

The Lowrys lived in Tacoma, a leafy, rain-slicked city near Seattle. At Seattle’s University of Washington hospital, where Nancy was being treated, the doctors had no clue what to do next. So they called a physician-scientist named E. Donnall Thomas, at the hospital in Cooperstown, New York, asking for help.

In the nineteen-fifties, Thomas had attempted a new kind of therapy, in which he infused a leukemia patient with marrow extracted from the patient’s healthy identical twin. There was fleeting evidence that the donated marrow cells had “engrafted” into the patient’s bones, but the patient had swiftly relapsed. Thomas had tried to refine the transplant protocol on dogs, with some marginal success. Now the Seattle doctors persuaded him to try again in humans. Nancy’s marrow was faltering, but no malignant cells were occupying it. Would the blood stem cells from one twin’s marrow “take” in the other twin?

Thomas flew to Seattle. On August 12, 1960, Barbara was sedated, and her hips and legs were punctured fifty times with a large-bore needle to extract the crimson sludge of her bone marrow. The marrow, diluted in saline, was then dripped into Nancy’s bloodstream. The doctors waited. The cells homed their way into her bones and gradually started to produce normal blood. By the time she was discharged, her marrow had been almost completely reconstituted. Nancy emerged as a living chimera: her blood, in a sense, belonged to her twin.

In 1963, Thomas moved to Seattle for good. Setting up his lab first at the Seattle Public Health Service Hospital and then, a dozen years later, at the newly established Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center—the Hutch, as doctors called it—he was determined to use marrow transplantation in the treatment of other diseases, notably leukemia. Nancy and Barbara Lowry were identical twins, and a noncancerous blood disease in one had been curable by cells from the other, a vanishingly rare occurrence. What if a disease involved malignant blood cells, as with leukemia? And what if the donor wasn’t a twin? The promise of transplantation had been hindered by the fact that our immune systems are inclined to reject matter from other bodies as foreign; only identical twins, with perfectly matched tissues, can sidestep the problem.

Thomas saw a way around this. First, he would try to eradicate the malignant blood cells with doses of chemotherapy and radiation so high that the functioning marrow would be destroyed, purged of both cancerous and normal cells. That would usually be fatal, but the donor marrow would then replace it, generating healthy new cells.

The next problems arose from trying an “allogeneic” transplant (allo, from the Greek word for “other”), using marrow from someone who wasn’t an identical twin. The resultant immune response is the consequence of an ancient system for maintaining the sovereignty of organisms. Sponges on the ocean floor use primitive versions of immune systems to reject cells from other sponges that might attempt to colonize them. Good defenses make good neighbors: in nature, chimerism, the fusion of one being with another, is not a new-age fantasy but an age-old threat.

Other pioneers in organ transplantation had learned that these forces of rejection could be blunted if the donor and the host were reasonably well matched. There were now tests to help predict compatibility and to improve the chances that allogeneic marrow cells would engraft. And various immune-suppressing drugs had been developed to further dampen the host’s resistance.

Thomas, who won a Nobel Prize for these studies, later described them as “early clinical successes.” But for the nurses and the technicians in Seattle who cared for the patients—not to mention the patients themselves—the experience could be harrowing. “Of the hundred patients with leukemia who were transplanted in those early years, eighty-three died within the first several months,” Fred Appelbaum, a former student of Thomas’s, told me. Sometimes the transplanted marrow failed to take, and the patient died from anemia caused by a lack of red blood cells, or from infections caused by the paucity of white blood cells; sometimes the cancer came back. He added, “What kind of person, with that rate of failure, would perform the hundred-and-first transplant?”

The final cataclysm, in this Biblical array of plagues, happened when white blood cells produced by the donor’s marrow mounted a vigorous immune response to the patient’s body. This phenomenon—called graft-versus-host disease—was sometimes a passing storm, and sometimes a chronic condition; either way, it turned the logic of immunology upside down. Typically, when foreign tissue is transplanted into a body, the fear is that the patient might reject it. But in these bone-marrow-graft cases it’s the transplant that rejects the patient. The immune cells of the bone-marrow donor—a mutinous crew forced onto an unfamiliar ship—recognize the body around them as foreign. Virtually every major organ system can fall under attack. In some cases, the disease proved fatal; in others, clinicians found ways to manage it with drugs.

In the late nineteen-seventies, Appelbaum and his colleagues analyzed the results of allogeneic transplants for leukemia, and found yet another surprise: the patients who had experienced graft-versus-host disease in its chronic form were also the ones whose cancers were least likely to relapse. The imported immune cells were effectively targeting residual cancer cells in the host. What Thomas had achieved with Lowry was akin to a regular organ transplant. (In 1954, in Boston, Joseph Murray had performed the first successful kidney transplant, also between twins.) But the phenomenon observed by doctors at the Hutch suggested that marrow grafts represented a very different kind of medical intervention.

From the start, those findings mesmerized the world of cell therapy. They showed that the human immune system—in particular, the T cell, a type of white blood cell that is central to what is known as “adaptive immunity”—could recognize and attack cancer. Which led to a question: Could T cells be trained to reject cancerous cells but not turn against the host? Could they be the basis of a new class of drug?

At this point, a larger question arises: What is a drug, anyway? A therapeutic substance, you might say. But does it have to be a molecule in its pure form, like aspirin or penicillin? Can it be a mixture of active ingredients—like cough syrup? A toxicologist might quarrel with the notion that certain substances are inherently therapeutic: water is a drug at one dose and a poison at another. Most chemotherapies are poisons even at the correct dose. Galen, the Greco-Roman physician of the second century, argued that all human pathology could be conceptualized as imbalances of humors—black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm. Could a humor, drawn from a patient’s body, qualify as a drug?",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/22/the-promise-and-price-of-cellular-therapies
"['Lizzie Widdicombe', 'Lizzie Widdicomb', 'Amy Davidson Sorki', 'Adam Gopni']",2019-06-03 ,Parenting by the Numbers,"Pregnancy! A time of wonder and anticipation. And paranoia. First comes the visit to your doctor, where you receive the (hopefully) happy news. Then comes the Talk, which goes something like: “Remember to take it easy for the next nine months. Pamper yourself. Get lots of sleep. And don’t eat any deli meats, or you could murder your baby.”

O.K., this might not be exactly what the doctor says, but it’s what many women hear. Daily life takes on a frightening new dimension. Is there toxoplasmosis on the cat’s butt? Is the hair salon full of poisonous fumes? Complicating things is the gap between the official recommendations and what people actually do. The handout says stick to “one small cup” of coffee and stay away from alcohol. But we all know that the coffee thing is B.S., and that it’s perfectly fine to have a glass of wine, because . . . they do it in France, right? What about that trending Times article, “Eating Nuts During Pregnancy Tied to Brain Benefits in Baby”? Or the fact that Kourtney Kardashian avoided microwaves after she had a baby?

Navigating this gantlet, when I was pregnant, I called a friend who had recently given birth. She cut me off, saying, “There’s a book you need to read.” The book was by Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University who studies health care. In her day job, she pores over medical journals and government data sets for insights into how we treat diseases such as Huntington’s, diabetes, and H.I.V./AIDS. In 2010, Oster got pregnant. Confronted with the usual mixed messages—her doctor told her that a glass of wine was “probably O.K.”—she went home, logged in to PubMed, a database of medical literature, and downloaded every study on alcohol and caffeine going back to the nineteen-eighties. She then spent several days performing a personal meta-analysis: evaluating the merits of the studies, throwing out the weak ones, and making an assessment of the risks. (Her conclusion: a glass of wine a day in the second or third trimester wasn’t a problem, and she could keep drinking coffee guilt-free.)

Oster’s research expanded into her 2013 book, “Expecting Better,” which became a hit among pregnant women—at least among the subset of pregnant women with the time and resources to devote to issues like caffeine dosage and sushi intake. In the book, Oster recounts the choices that she faced during her pregnancy and tackles such topics as prohibited foods, weight gain, and C-sections, frequently dismantling the received wisdom. Flatteringly, she addresses her reader as a peer. She doesn’t issue opaque decrees, with the implicit condescension of “Trust me, I’m an expert.” She doesn’t slip into cutesy jargon, like the pun-prone authors of the latest edition of “What to Expect When You’re Expecting,” who call pregnant women “Mama” and suggest that you “start every morning with a bump selfie.” Instead, she takes the reader on a tour of the scientific literature, even describing the methodology of specific studies to show how she made each decision. Lauren Kay, the executive editor of the pregnancy and parenting Web site the Bump, explained Oster’s appeal to me in an e-mail: “The whole tone of the book is very pro-Mom, putting the power back in the hands of the pregnant woman. I read it when I was pregnant with my first child, and it left me feeling empowered to ask my OB why or why not. It also reminded me that I was part of the equation, too.”

Despite the plaudits, the book didn’t go over well with many public-health officials, who disagreed especially vehemently with Oster’s conclusions about alcohol. The president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, on Boston’s NPR station, that Oster’s advice was wrong: “We need to err on the side of caution, and the side of caution says that we have not been able to identify any amount of alcohol that is absolutely safe in pregnancy.” But Oster’s fans were undeterred. Amy Schumer called Oster “the non-judgmental girlfriend holding our hand and guiding us through pregnancy and motherhood.”

Last month, Oster published a sequel, “Cribsheet,” subtitled “A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool.” It takes on subjects like cold season, nap schedules, and potty training. As the mother of a sixteen-month-old, I had a host of burning questions: Will she ever willingly wear clothes? Is it wrong to buy those little kids’ leashes? Why does she put her finger in other babies’ mouths and say, “Bite”?

Parenting experts have been around for as long as there have been anxious parents. They have channelled the fears and the aspirations of their times. Eighteenth-century parents adopted Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s ideas about “natural” parenting—cold air is good for a child!—even though he’d left all five of his children at a foundling hospital. Dr. Spock, who had trained in psychoanalysis, gave parenting advice a Freudian spin, and his mantra—“Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do”—soothed addled Cold War parents.

It makes sense that our parenting expert du jour is a data wonk. In some ways, data are to today’s parents what psychoanalysis was to the postwar generation: a hoped-for savior. We try to make sense of a chaotic world by reading Nate Silver’s political forecasts and wearing devices that count our steps. At the same time, Big Data is increasingly sinister. If you’ve been pregnant lately, you’ve undoubtedly had the eerie experience of seeing baby-related ads popping up online before you’ve shared the news with anyone. The information age has turned out to be a breeding ground for misinformation, with “Moneyball” giving way to Twitter bots, viral pseudoscience, and dubious Facebook news feeds.

Oster is here to help you navigate this glut. As a pop-economist, she follows in the tradition of Steven Levitt, of “Freakonomics” fame. Levitt, who has six children, including two who are younger than three, told me that Oster’s first book “is the bible of my circle.” At a time when pregnancy and child rearing have become polarized and moralized—natural births, water births, orgasmic births?—it can be refreshing to hear from someone who sticks to the numbers. “Economists focus on how the world is,” Levitt told me. “A lot of parenting advice is focussed on how the world should be in someone’s mind.”

What did I want from Oster’s books? Until recently, most of life’s outcomes seemed within my control. If I exercised, I could get in shape. (Not that I ever did.) If I worked hard at school, and then at my job, I could earn good grades and promotions. But becoming a parent was different. No matter how many pregnancy apps I downloaded, I couldn’t control when I would get pregnant, or if it would go well. And, after the baby arrived, I seemed to be stuck in crisis mode. The data seemed like a way to get back, if not power, then at least a sense of mastery.

Oster now has two children, Penelope and Finn, who are eight and four. She spends most of her days in her office at Brown, where she is currently researching methodological problems with data on health trends (vitamins, superfoods). Given the subject matter of her books, I thought it best to see her in the domestic sphere. I arrived at her home, in Providence, Rhode Island, at 6:30 a.m. It was still dark outside. Oster was standing at her kitchen counter in working-mom attire: a black business skirt and stockings, with a zip-up hoodie over her blouse to protect it from grubby hands. The place was neat but minimally furnished—an indication, to me, that she wasn’t especially interested in interior decorating. But I knew from her books that she likes to sew, and there were two plates of attractive muffins on the counter. She’d gotten up at 5 a.m. to bake.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/03/parenting-by-the-numbers
"['Elizabeth Kolbert', 'Elizabeth Kolber', 'Eric Klinenber', 'John Mcphe']",2019-04-01 ,Louisiana’s Disappearing Coast,"The New Orleans Lakefront Airport was built by the Louisiana governor Huey P. Long on a tongue of fill that sticks out into Lake Pontchartrain. Its terminal was designed by the same architect Long had used to build a new Louisiana state capitol and a new governor’s mansion, and it was originally named for one of Long’s cronies, Abraham Shushan. Within eighteen months of the airport’s opening, in 1934, Shushan had been indicted for money laundering and Long had been murdered. A few years later, the architect, too, went to prison.

Today, Lakefront Airport is used for small planes, which is how I recently found myself there, aboard a four-seat Piper Warrior. The Piper’s pilot and owner was a lawyer who liked having an excuse to fly. The plane took off to the north, over Lake Pontchartrain, and looped back toward New Orleans. We picked up the Mississippi at English Turn, the sharp bend that brings the river almost full circle. Then we continued to follow the water as it wound its way into Plaquemines Parish.

Plaquemines is where the river meets the sea. On maps, it appears as a thick, muscular arm stretching into the Gulf of Mexico, with the Mississippi running, like a ropy blue vein, down the center. At the very end of the arm, the main channel divides into three, an arrangement that calls to mind fingers or claws, hence the area’s name—the Bird’s Foot.

Seen from the air, the parish has a very different look. If it’s an arm, it’s a horribly emaciated one. For most of its length—more than sixty miles—it’s practically all vein. What little solid land there is clings to the river in two skinny strips.

Flying at an altitude of two thousand feet, I could make out the houses and farms and refineries that fill the strips, though not the people who live or work in them. Beyond was open water or patchy marsh. In many spots, the patches were crisscrossed with channels. Presumably, these had been dug when the land was firmer, to get at the oil underneath. In some places, I could see the outlines of what were once fields and are now rectilinear lakes. Great white clouds, billowing above the plane, were mirrored in the black pools below.

Plaquemines has the distinction—a dubious one, at best—of being among the fastest-disappearing places on Earth. Everyone who lives in the parish—and fewer and fewer people do—can point to some stretch of water that used to have a house or a hunting camp on it. This is true even of teen-agers. A few years ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officially retired thirty-one Plaquemines place-names, including Bay Jacquin and Dry Cypress Bayou, because there was no there there anymore.

And what’s happening to Plaquemines is happening all along the coast. Since the days of Huey Long, Louisiana has shrunk by more than two thousand square miles. If Delaware or Rhode Island had lost that much territory, the U.S. would have only forty-nine states. Every hour and a half, Louisiana sheds another football field’s worth of land. Every few minutes, it drops a tennis court’s worth. On maps, the state may still resemble a boot. Really, though, the bottom of the boot is in tatters, missing not just a sole but also its heel and a good part of its instep.

A variety of factors are driving the “land-loss crisis,” as it’s come to be called. But the essential one is a marvel of engineering. Thousands of miles of levees, flood walls, and revetments have been erected to manage the Mississippi. As the Army Corps of Engineers once boasted, “We harnessed it, straightened it, regularized it, shackled it.” This vast system, built to keep southern Louisiana dry, is the very reason the region is disintegrating, coming apart like an old shoe.

But if control is the problem it must also, by the logic of the Anthropocene, be the solution. And so a huge new public-works project is getting under way—this one aimed not at flood control so much as at controlled flooding. Ten pharaonic structures are planned. The furthest along of these is slated for Plaquemines Parish. It will feature enough concrete and riprap to pave Greenwich Village and, when operating at full capacity, will, by flow, be the twelfth-largest river in the country.

In one form or another, the Mississippi has been winding its way to the Gulf for millions of years. All the while, it has been carrying on its broad back vast loads of sediment—at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, some four hundred million tons annually. “I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river is a strong brown god,” T. S. Eliot wrote. Whenever it overtopped its banks—something it used to do virtually every spring—the river cast its sediment across the plain. Season after season, layer after layer, clay and sand and silt built up. In this way, the “strong brown god” assembled the Louisiana Gulf Coast out of bits and pieces of Illinois and Iowa and Minnesota and Missouri and Arkansas and Kentucky.

Because the Mississippi is always dropping sediment, it is always on the move, seeking new and faster routes to the sea. Its most dramatic leaps are called avulsions. In the last seven thousand years, the river has avulsed six times, and each time it has set about laying down a new bulge of land. Lafourche Parish is what’s left of the lobe laid down during the reign of Charlemagne. Western Terrebonne Parish is the remains of a delta lobe built during the time of the Phoenicians. The city of New Orleans sits on a lobe—the St. Bernard—created around the time of the pyramids. Many still more ancient lobes are now submerged.

The Mississippi’s most recent lobe is the Plaquemines-Balize Delta, otherwise known as Plaquemines Parish. It started to build about fifteen hundred years ago, after the river’s last great leap. The next avulsion is now overdue. Only human invention, in the form of steel and concrete, stands in its way.

Meanwhile, as the Mississippi has pushed lobe after lobe into the sea, the sea has pushed back. The delta’s soft, jello-like soils tend to de-water and compact over time, with the newest layers, which are wetter, losing bulk most rapidly. Where the river delivers enough sand and clay to make up for the lost volume, the land holds its own. Where compaction outpaces accretion, the land begins to subside until, eventually, the Gulf reclaims it. In southern Louisiana, to borrow from Bob Dylan, any place that is “not busy being born is busy dying.”

Such a mutable landscape is a hard one to settle. Nevertheless, Native Americans were probably living in the delta even as it was being created. Their strategy for dealing with the river’s vagaries, as far as archeologists have been able to determine, was one of accommodation. If the Mississippi flooded, they sought higher ground. If it shifted quarters, they did, too.

When the French arrived, they consulted with the tribes living there. In the winter of 1700, the colonists erected a wooden fort on what’s now the east bank of Plaquemines. Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville, the fort’s commander, had been assured by a Bayogoula guide that the fort’s site was a dry one. Whether this represented a purposeful misstatement or just a misunderstanding, “dry” in southern Louisiana being a relative term, the place soon flooded out. A priest who visited the following winter found soldiers wading “mid-leg deep” to get to their cabins. In 1707, the fort was abandoned. “I do not see how settlers can be placed on this river,” Iberville’s brother Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville wrote to the authorities in Paris, explaining the retreat.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/louisianas-disappearing-coast
"['Adam Gopnik', 'Adam Gopni', 'Larissa Macfarquha', 'Tad Frien']",2019-05-20 ,Can We Live Longer but Stay Younger?,"Aging, like bankruptcy in Hemingway’s description, happens two ways, slowly and then all at once. The slow way is the familiar one: decades pass with little sense of internal change, middle age arrives with only a slight slowing down—a name lost, a lumbar ache, a sprinkling of white hairs and eye wrinkles. The fast way happens as a series of lurches: eyes occlude, hearing dwindles, a hand trembles where it hadn’t, a hip breaks—the usually hale and hearty doctor’s murmur in the yearly checkup, There are some signs here that concern me.

To get a sense of what it would be like to have the slow process become the fast process, you can go to the AgeLab, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, and put on agnes (for Age Gain Now Empathy System). agnes, or the “sudden aging” suit, as Joseph Coughlin, the founder and director of the AgeLab describes it, includes yellow glasses, which convey a sense of the yellowing of the ocular lens that comes with age; a boxer’s neck harness, which mimics the diminished mobility of the cervical spine; bands around the elbows, wrists, and knees to simulate stiffness; boots with foam padding to produce a loss of tactile feedback; and special gloves to “reduce tactile acuity while adding resistance to finger movements.”

Slowly pulling on the aging suit and then standing up—it looks a bit like one of the spacesuits that the Russian cosmonauts wore—you’re at first conscious merely of a little extra weight, a little loss of feeling, a small encumbrance or two at the extremities. Soon, though, it’s actively infuriating. The suit bends you. It slows you. You come to realize what makes it a powerful instrument of emotional empathy: every small task becomes effortful. “Reach up to the top shelf and pick up that mug,” Coughlin orders, and doing so requires more attention than you expected. You reach for the mug instead of just getting it. Your emotional cast, as focussed task piles on focussed task, becomes one of annoyance; you acquire the same set-mouthed, unhappy, watchful look you see on certain elderly people on the subway. The concentration that each act requires disrupts the flow of life, which you suddenly become aware is the happiness of life, the ceaseless flow of simple action and responses, choices all made simultaneously and mostly without effort. Happiness is absorption, and absorption is the opposite of willful attention.

The annoyance, after a half hour or so in the suit, tips over into anger: Damn, what’s wrong with the world? (Never: What’s wrong with me?) The suit makes us aware not so much of the physical difficulties of old age, which can be manageable, but of the mental state disconcertingly associated with it—the price of age being perpetual aggravation. The theme and action and motive of King Lear suddenly become perfectly clear. You become enraged at your youngest daughter’s reticence because you have had to struggle to unroll the map of your kingdom.

The AgeLab is designed to alleviate this progression. It exists to encourage and incubate new technologies and products and services for an ever-larger market of aging people. (“Every eight seconds, a baby boomer turns seventy-three,” Coughlin observes.) Coughlin, who is in his late fifties, is the image of an old-fashioned American engineer-entrepreneur; he is bald in the old-fashioned, tonsured, Thurber-husband way, wears a bow tie and heavy red-framed glasses, and, walking a visitor through the lab, suggests a cross between Mr. Peabody and Q, from the Bond films, showing you the latest gadgets. His talk is crisply aphoristic and irrigated with an easy flow of statistics: each proposition has its instantly associated number.

“Where science is ambiguous, politics begins,” he says. “In the designation of some states, an older driver is fifty, in some eighty—we don’t even know what an older driver is. That ambiguity is an itch I wanted to scratch. Over the past century, we’ve created the greatest gift in the history of humanity—thirty extra years of life—and we don’t know what to do with it! Now that we’re living longer, how do we plan for what we’re going to do?”

Having picked the mug up, the suit wearer finds that setting the mug down gently on a nearby table is also a bit of a challenge. So is following Coughlin from room to room as he narrates all that the AgeLab has learned.

“Here’s a useful model for you,” he says. “From zero to twenty-one is about eight thousand days. From twenty-one to midlife crisis is eight thousand days. From mid-forties to sixty-five—eight thousand days. Nowadays, if you make it to sixty-five you have a fifty-per-cent chance you’ll make it to eighty-five. Another eight thousand days! That’s no longer a trip to Disney and wait for the grandchildren to visit and die of the virus you get on a cruise. We’re talking about rethinking, redefining one-third of adult life! The greatest achievement in the history of humankind—and all we can say is that it’s going to make Medicare go broke? Why don’t we take that one-third and create new stories, new rituals, new mythologies for people as they age?”

The agnes suit is one of many instruments and appliances—or “cool toys,” as they are more technically known—that can be found in the AgeLab’s glass-walled halls and cubicled corridors, ready to entertain visiting writers, and to instruct visiting entrepreneurs. There is the driving simulator, specially fitted to track the driver’s eye movements as they flit back and forth from the dashboard to the horizon. (“With its new technologies, like navigation systems, the automotive industry is asking people to change fifty years of driving habits in ten minutes without instruction,” Coughlin says.) There is Paro, a robotic baby seal, from Japan, which bleats and moves its head, and is designed to act as a comfort to aging people, particularly Alzheimer’s patients struggling with the “sundown” moment at day’s end, when confusion and restlessness become acute. (“It’s a seal, rather than a dog or a cat, because people have great experiences with dogs and cats, and even Alzheimer’s patients can spot the eerie non-resemblance,” Coughlin says. “Having no experience of seals, we accept Paro as he is.”) There are mobile robotic nurses made for elderly care, and broad red upholstered chairs made for elderly rears. There are large research displays showing photographs of drivers, their faces embedded with sensors, and the varieties of “Glance Classification” that can, when analyzed, lead to “Crash Avoidance.” (“The ratio between confident decisions and correct confident decisions can be a story of life or death on the highway,” Coughlin explains.) And there are displays of word clouds associated with aging, showing the significant difference between the terms with which women imagine their post-career lives (Freedom, Time, Family) and those which men use (Retirement, Relax, Hobbies).

The work of the AgeLab is shaped by a paradox. Having been established to engineer and promote new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged, the AgeLab swiftly discovered that engineering and promoting new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged is a good way of going out of business. Old people will not buy anything that reminds them that they are old. They are a market that cannot be marketed to. In effect, to accept help in getting out of the suit is to accept that we’re in the suit for life. We would rather suffer because we’re old than accept that we’re old and suffer less.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/can-we-live-longer-but-stay-younger
"['Kerry Elson', 'Kerry Elso', 'Jessica Delfin', 'Sara Lautma', 'Ysabel Yate', 'Ali Kelley']",2020-05-02,How to Relax with a Candle While Thoroughly Following Candle-Safety Protocol,"Are you ready to totally relax with a candle? No? Let’s try it anyway. Cuddle up with a flame-retardant blanket and take a tentative seat because it’s candle relaxation time! Here are steps for getting started:

Write a letter to your niece, just in case she decides to visit and finds only a pile of ash. You could say something like “I was trying to relax with one of my candles. Hope you’re well. Please take care of my gem collection.”

Survey the many candles your friends have given you, spread out on your kitchen table, coated in dust. Rearrange them a little bit. Now you’re one step closer to lighting your first candle, all by yourself!

Pick up a candle and try reading the label. Unfortunately, all it says is “Gardenia and orange blossom. Good luck and try your best. Sincerely, California Candles.”

Get renters’ insurance. This is a good idea in general, actually. Tell everyone you encounter to get renters’ insurance, because you never know what might happen. Send your friends text messages about renters’ insurance. Write a LinkedIn post about it, and then create a Snapchat story about renters’ insurance for the young people. Also, make a TikTok video. Don’t forget to write a book. Great job! You’ve continued to delay lighting your candle.

Think about how you would light a candle, if you were to light one. Snapping your fingers is, unfortunately, not an option. Locate the lighter you bought in high school to look cool. Spend twenty minutes trying to get it to ignite. Acknowledge that it’s a really old lighter and deserves to retire. Visit a hardware store and look for matches. Go ahead and buy the big box of matches! Once you figure out how to light a candle, you will probably be lighting them all the time.

When you get home, clear everything from the kitchen table. Put away all the newspapers, the wooden salt and pepper grinders, the shopping bags, and your gems. Put your chosen candle in the middle of the table and place the matchbox next to it.

Load the candle into the candle holster. If you don’t have a candle holster, you can also use a candle harness. Both of these are simple contraptions that you can make with rubber bands, twist ties, duct tape, and magnets.

Secure the candle holster or harness to the table so that the candle absolutely cannot tip over, even if you were to skip pebbles in the candle’s direction.

Build a brick fortress around the candle. If the candle does tip over somehow, despite your precautions, the bricks will trap the flames, keep you safe, and protect your gems. Make sure to leave an opening at the top of the fortress so that oxygen can reach the candle and the fire can keep burning. Remember, your goal is to light a flame so that you can look at it, think about eternity, and begin your hundred-per-cent, no-holds-barred relaxation experience.

Light the match. No, you have to do it because no one else is here. Do it quickly. Now reach over the fortress walls, hold the flame to the wick, and light that wick. Blow out the match. Done! Wipe your sweaty hands on your shirt.

Ease into your chair, gently place your hands in your lap, and sit.

No, you can’t look at your phone. Just sit there with your feet flat on the floor, preferably away from any part of the table, for extra safety. Imagine you are that tiny flame, gently surging and striving to get out of your seat. Nope, sit back down.

Count to thirty. You lit that candle and you’re sitting across from it. You did it! Feel proud that you conquered your fear of small fires and lit your first candle on your own. Take a photo of your candle and post it on Instagram.

Receive a call from your mom, who saw your Instagram post. Listen to her say, “I see that you are relaxing with a candle. Did you know that a thousand and forty-six people died last year because they lit a candle, the candle fell over, and then they caught on fire? You can make your own decisions. That is all I wanted to say.”

Blow out the candle. Feel your shoulder muscles un-tense. Take a deep breath. At last, you can truly relax.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/how-to-relax-with-a-candle-while-thoroughly-following-candle-safety-protocol
"['Françoise Mouly', 'Françoise Moul']",2020-05-05,Christoph Mueller’s “Shelter in Place”,"The coronavirus has hit different countries in different ways, but billions of people worldwide are now living with some kind of restriction on public life. This week’s cover, by Christoph Mueller, an artist based in Germany, portrays a now common experience: seeing life, and the bloom of spring, through a window. We talked to Mueller recently about the image.

Europe has been in quarantine for more than a month. Have you still been able to enjoy strolls in nature? And, if so, how has the experience shifted?

My wife, Leonie, and I live close to the Dutch border, and our favorite getaway is a small heathland nature reserve in the Netherlands. It’s an incredibly beautiful place that has an almost spiritual effect on me. Unfortunately, nonessential people are not allowed to cross the borders at the moment, so we’ve switched to taking our strolls through small local parks. They’re nice, but I do miss those Dutch pines. Fortunately, we had a chance to collect some seeds during our last visit to the heathlands, and we’re now growing a pine forest in the living room of our apartment.

Has sheltering in place made you more or less aware of what’s going on outside your window?

Much more aware—and I mean that quite literally. I’ve developed a habit of looking out the window right after I get up in the morning: I step into the living room, greet Wembley and Schlomi, our two cockatiels, and stare outside the window for a while, almost like I am searching for some sort of confirmation, for signs of normality, some real-life feedback that lets me know that we’ll be O.K. for another day. After that, I check on our baby pines and make coffee.

Does your approach shift when you set out to tell a story in one image, like this cover, versus a comic strip?

I don’t think I’ve ever thought about that. Usually, I start with the specs of what I’m aiming for, do my research, and keep thinking about it until I arrive at some sort of emotional starting point. Then the image or images just sort of work their way through my hand onto the paper. I try to not overthink the underlying mechanics too much.",newyorker,http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2020-05-11
"['Adam Kirsch', 'Adam Kirsc', 'Judith Thurma', 'Alex Ros']",2020-05-05,Søren Kierkegaard’s Struggle with Himself,"Imagine an educated, affluent European in his late twenties, seemingly one of fortune’s favored, who suffers from crippling feelings of despair and guilt. For no apparent reason, he breaks up with the woman everyone thought he was going to marry—not because he loves someone else but out of a sudden conviction that he is incapable of marriage and can only make her miserable. He abandons the career for which he has been studying for ten years and holes up in his apartment, where a kind of graphomania compels him to stay up all night writing at a frantic pace. His activity is so relentless that, in a few short years, he has accumulated many volumes’ worth of manuscripts.

If this happened today—say, in Denmark, the standard example of a rational modern society—the man would sooner or later end up in a psychiatrist’s office, where he would probably be given a diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder. He would start seeing a therapist and might be prescribed medication. The goal would be to get him back to normal, as the world defines “normal”: able to take pleasure in life, to form relationships, to meet his obligations as a family member, friend, and citizen. The man would seek professional help, because, in the twenty-first century, he would recognize his propensities as symptoms—evidence of a psychological problem.

But when Søren Kierkegaard underwent these experiences in the Denmark of the eighteen-forties they had a different meaning. “At times, there is such a noise in my head that it is as though my cranium were being lifted up, it is exactly like when the hobgoblins lift a mountain up a little and then hold a ball and make merry inside,” he wrote in his journal in February, 1838, when he was twenty-four. But Kierkegaard had learned from Romantic literature that wild emotion was a sign of genius, especially when it was painful. “Real depression, like the ‘vapors,’ is found only in the highest circles, in the former case understood in a spiritual sense,” he wrote two months later. He considered his “melancholy” not a disease but a “close confidant . . . the most faithful mistress I have known.”

Side by side with this fashionable style of feeling, Kierkegaard inherited from his ancestors a rigorously introspective Protestantism. His father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard, had grown up poor in the countryside, moved to Copenhagen to become a merchant, and ended up as one of the city’s richest men. Michael Pedersen raised his seven children, of whom Søren was the youngest, under strict religious discipline, instilling a sense of fear and guilt that never left them. “Oh, how frightful it is when for a moment I think of the dark background of my life, right from the earliest days!” Kierkegaard recalled. “The anxiety with which my father filled my soul, his own frightful melancholy.”

For Kierkegaard, unhappiness became not a condition but a vocation. In a new biography, “Philosopher of the Heart” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), the British scholar Clare Carlisle shows that this calling consumed his life. After leaving school, at the age of seventeen, in 1830, he enrolled as a theology student at the University of Copenhagen, in order to prepare for a career in the church. But it took him ten years to complete his degree, and he never became a pastor or had any other kind of job. He never got married or had children. Other than a few visits to Berlin, then the capital of philosophy, and one trip to Sweden, Kierkegaard never left Denmark. He took no interest in politics. In 1848, the liberal revolutions sweeping Europe reached Denmark, as protests forced the king to promise a new constitution and parliament; but Kierkegaard was indifferent. “So the king flees—and so there is a republic,” he wrote in his journal that year. “Piffle.”

What he did instead was write. Until his death, in 1855, at the age of forty-two, Kierkegaard lived off his inheritance and produced a stream of unclassifiable books—hybrids of philosophy, autobiography, fiction, and sermon. Advancing deeper and deeper into the experience of suffering, he emerged with a profoundly new way of thinking about human existence. The dark exigency of Kierkegaard’s books, which he sometimes published two or even four at a time, is plain from their titles: “Fear and Trembling,” “The Concept of Anxiety,” “The Sickness Unto Death.”

In that last book, which appeared in 1849, Kierkegaard offers an uncompromising diagnosis of the human condition. “There is not a single human being who does not despair at least a little, in whose innermost being there does not dwell an uneasiness, an unquiet, a discordance, an anxiety in the face of an unknown something,” he writes. If you don’t think you are in despair, you are lying to yourself, which is an even worse form of despair. Only by acknowledging our condition, he says, can we begin to understand that the true name of despair is sin, defiance of God. We are freed from it only when we accept that “a human self is under an obligation to obey God—in its every secret desire and thought.”

This understanding of sin and redemption wasn’t Kierkegaard’s invention. Something like it was preached in Denmark’s Lutheran churches every Sunday. What made his work explosive was his insistence that those very churches had become the chief obstacles to genuine Christian belief. Nineteenth-century Europeans took for granted that they were Christians simply because they were living in “Christendom,” in countries where there were “just as many Christians as there are people,” he wrote. But a Christian, for Kierkegaard, isn’t something you are born; it is something you have to become through terrific inner effort. His “authorship,” as he called it, was meant as an alarm bell to wake the modern world from its spiritual slumber.

Kierkegaard published his books at his own expense, and they initially had a tiny readership: the most popular, “Either/Or,” didn’t sell out its first edition of five hundred and twenty-five copies for three years. Nevertheless, he became a local celebrity, thanks mainly to his eccentricities and his penchant for public feuds. The editor of one Copenhagen paper, the Corsair, observed that, in “Kierkegaard’s entire personal appearance and manner, there was something that verged on the comic.” When the Corsair portrayed him in a series of mocking caricatures, in 1846, he became even more notorious. “Every kitchen boy feels justified in almost insulting me . . . young students titter and grin and are happy to see a prominent person trampled on,” he complained.

When he died—probably of tuberculosis, though the diagnosis remains unclear—Kierkegaard had few if any readers outside Denmark. That didn’t begin to change until he found an influential champion in the Danish literary critic Georg Brandes, who, in 1877, wrote the first book about Kierkegaard and brought him to the attention of a wider European audience. (Later, Brandes did the same for Nietzsche.) The first English translations of Kierkegaard appeared in the nineteen-thirties, and it wasn’t until the sixties, more than a century after his death, that the translators Howard and Edna Hong began to produce a complete English edition of his works.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/soren-kierkegaards-struggle-with-himself
"['Anthony Lane', 'Anthony Lan']",2020-05-05,Streaming Releases Test the Waters of a Changed Industry,"In the olden days, which, according to historians, ended a few months ago, people used to do the strangest things. They exchanged what were known as “hugs,” presumably a unit of currency, or else “handshakes,” which, judging by the name, may well have been a strain of palsy. “Going out for a drink” entailed gathering at some form of communal well, an obvious source of infection. There was also something called “making out.” Ethnological research has identified this as ritualistic playacting, often terminating in humiliation. No activity from that far-off period, however, seems as inexplicable as this: humans went to the movies.

Details are scarce, and memories are hazy, including my own. But I seem to recall that we sat in a blacked-out room, in rows, and frequently in discomfort. We did so of our own volition, and paid for the privilege, even though screenings began at an appointed hour and—imagine this!—the content had been determined, in advance, on our behalf. Interactivity stood at zero. We could neither quicken nor freeze the action, and those wishing to follow a narrative in its entirety were forced to develop ferocious bladder control. Drinks and foodstuffs were allowed, but only if purchased on the premises and guaranteed to promote active dental decay. Why we tolerated these outrageous restrictions on our personal liberty, and why some of us persisted in venturing out to the cinema rather than staying at home to view a product of our choosing, while snacking on crap from our own fridge, is a puzzle that may never be solved. Perhaps our minds were unsound.

Now, of course, that option no longer exists. Movie theatres are closed across America, especially in the larger and denser cities. Even if you stumble upon a venue that has remained open, stop and think. In all honesty, you should no more watch a new release in the company of coughing strangers than you should visit your grandma and give her a birthday hug. And, anyway, what is there to watch?

One of the first signs that COVID-19 would play havoc with our moviegoing habits came with the news that 007 was running scared. The world première of the new James Bond film, bearing the deeply unfortunate title “No Time to Die,” was meant to take place at the Royal Albert Hall, in London, on March 31st. Oh, to be in England, now that Bond was there! The plan was for the movie to open in the United States on April 10th, and the publicity machine had been pumping away for months. The trailers were out; the talk shows were booked; the Aston Martin was having a final wax. Then the blow fell. “No Time to Die” will now be released in November—a relief for Daniel Craig, who can throw his tux back in the wardrobe, put on a sweater, and get out the Scrabble board, but a wrenching loss for the rest of us. The chance to revel gaily in the latest Bond production, and then to lament that it wasn’t as good as the last one, or the one before that, or the one with the Japanese volcano, comes along every four or five years, and is connected to the great circle of life. Without 007, how shall we endure the spring?

As with Bond, so with “Mulan.” Disney and other studios have delayed the explosion of their major films. Marvel has shunted “Black Widow” to November 6th, and another of its offerings, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” all the way to May, 2021. I’m not sure I can wait that long. “A Quiet Place Part II” has tiptoed softly to September, and other follow-ups have taken to their heels; somehow, we must get through this year without fresh installments of “Peter Rabbit” and “Fast & Furious.” Maybe those two should cut their losses and merge into one mega-sequel, with Vin Diesel as Mr. McGregor.

Procrastination, though, is not the only game in town. There has also been brinkmanship, with the studios eying each other and wondering: Who will be the first to blink? Who will think, Screw it—let’s forget about a motion-picture event, scrap the launch, and switch to a streamed release? Prophets of a gloomy bent believe that history is curving in this direction anyway: that cinemas are fated to fall into disuse, with tumbleweed rolling in the aisles, and that the future of film belongs online, where the new Spielberg, say, or the new Bong Joon-ho, will have to hold its own against outtakes from “Friends” and videos of cats wearing hats. If this argument is correct, the coronavirus has merely hastened the inevitable, and we should honor, not pity, the movie that has paid the ultimate price, forgoing the majesty of the large screen for the sake of a digital download. Such a sacrifice will never be forgotten. That movie is “Trolls World Tour.”

The first “Trolls” movie came out in 2016. It made three hundred and forty-seven million dollars. If, owing to some tragic oversight, you failed to see it, you should know that it was a candy-colored, song-stuffed, sparkle-strewn, computer-animated film that hymned the virtues of dancing, hugging, and finding your happy place. For those of us who assumed that a troll was some gnarly bastard from Norse legend, or a costive hermit harassing celebrities on his laptop, these rebooted Trolls, inexorably genial, came as a surprise. They made the Cabbage Patch Kids look like the Trojan Women.

The new film repeats the prescription, with a spoonful of scares to help the sugar go down. The dainty-hearted Queen Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) learns that Barb (Rachel Bloom), who rules the Rock Trolls, wants to eradicate all other kinds of music, not least the meaningless pop that lends both value and depth to Poppy’s existence. With the aid of her pal Branch (Justin Timberlake), Poppy embarks on a mission to save Trollkind, and to slather us with a message of creamy togetherness. All yours to rent, for just under twenty dollars.

But will you rent it? The rationale is clear enough. With families trapped inside by COVID-19, and children out of school and starting to climb the walls, a hyperactive new movie ought to be just the ticket. Also, twenty bucks is less than you’d pay at the cinema for yourself, your kids, and your silo-size Cokes. Yet the sum feels extortionate when you’re shelling out at home, perhaps because it carries a sweaty whiff of boxing bouts on pay-per-view. You half expect Tyson Fury, and you get Queen Poppy. In short, “Trolls World Tour” is a test case. To date, having earned almost a hundred million dollars online, this proud herald of the streaming age is well on the way to finding its happy place.

Thus far, of all the films that were made with meaty budgets and destined for a wide release, “Trolls World Tour” alone has traded the multiplex for a slot on your TV, or your annoyingly cracked phone. Smaller independent movies, though, are already making the jump, as if more confident of recouping their costs. Take “True History of the Kelly Gang,” adapted from Peter Carey’s novel of the same title and directed by Justin Kurzel. Set and shot in Australia, it stars George MacKay (who played the lone hero in “1917”) as Ned Kelly and features Russell Crowe, impenetrably bearded, in a minor role. The total budget, I reckon, might just about have covered the special effects in “Black Widow,” not counting Scarlett Johansson’s boots.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/streaming-releases-test-the-waters-of-a-changed-industry
"['Zach Helfand', 'Zach Helfan', 'John Cassid', 'Charles Bethe']",2020-05-05,The New York Renters Who Can’t Pay May,"Two rent payments ago, Donald Trump announced what he termed some “really positive things” for millions of people who were nervous about evictions during the economic shutdown. “Landlords are going to take it easy!” he said. This was not rhetoric: Trump International Hotel, in Washington, D.C., soon asked for rent relief from its own landlord, the federal government, which has yet to announce a decision on whether to grant it. (Evictions continued apace at the real-estate firm owned by Jared Kushner.) Despite the news, rent was still due on April 1st for most American renters, and nearly a third of them couldn’t pay. More were expected to fall off the books for May.

“I have seven hundred and seventy-three dollars in my bank account,” Winsome Pendergrass, a Jamaican-born domestic worker, said at the end of last month. “My rent is nine hundred and fifty-eight dollars and sixty-five cents. I paid in April, but now I can’t. I call it Can’t-Pay May.”

Pendergrass, who is sixty-two, sat on a sofa in the two-and-a-half-bedroom apartment in Brownsville that she shares with her daughter, her granddaughter, and a lot of plants. She is trying to turn missed rent payments into a movement. She belongs to New York Communities for Change, a group that has organized a rent strike among its five thousand members. “We try to encourage our members: Have a conversation with your landlord,” she said. “But many landlords are pushing papers under their doors saying, ‘Your responsibility is to pay.’ ”

New York State has banned evictions until mid-June, and a bill proposed in the City Council seeks to extend the grace period to April, 2021, in the five boroughs, but renters will have to make up missed payments. Pendergrass and her group have called on Trump and Governor Andrew Cuomo to cancel rents and mortgages permanently for the duration of the stay-at-home order.

Pendergrass was getting ready for a rent-strike meeting, held on Zoom, for renters across the city. She wore red lipstick and earrings in the shape of leaves. Around dinnertime, video feeds started popping up on her screen. Fifty-eight people attended the last meeting. This time, there were a hundred and eighty-eight.

People shared their stories. Peggy Perkins (1 BR, $1,336, Hempstead, mold problems) said she’d been homeless, with three children, before finally finding financial stability. She’d just registered a name for a beauty parlor she planned to open: Luxurious LaBelle Hair and Spa. She was applying for a loan when the coronavirus hit. No more haircuts, no more income. She tried talking to her landlord, but he wouldn’t negotiate. (He said he needs the money to pay his employees, such as the building’s superintendent.)

Another woman, Donnette (1½ BR, $1,700, Canarsie), had been working as a home health aide but lost her job on April 12th, when her client, who was ninety-eight, died from the virus. Donnette stayed with the woman at her nursing home, because her family wasn’t allowed in. “I refused to leave her,” she said. “It was a choice. It was no longer employment, but it was duty.” Donnette said she could get by for a few months, if she zeroed out her savings. She didn’t expect to receive a stimulus check, because she is an undocumented immigrant, from Jamaica. “I’m trying to do the math, and I can’t make sense of it,” she said.

“She’s not a lazy person,” Pendergrass said of Donnette, after the meeting. “As they say, a Jamaican’s always got three jobs. And is going to school. But the hammer is over her head.” Pendergrass is now a U.S. citizen. She thought her own three-job days were over, but she figures that, without assistance, she’ll have to start working extended hours, seven days a week, to keep her apartment. Recently, she called her life-insurance company to ask about taking money out.

A man in an oversized gray shirt began to speak. He was nervous about the strike. “All the people I know are very scared,” he said, in Spanish. “We’re not going to pay rent for two or three months? O.K., that’s fine, but what about after? We’re going to be in debt.”

Pendergrass jumped in. If they couldn’t pay, she said, they were better off not paying together. “We are just forcing Albany to address renters,” she said. “We are the sufferers.”

People kept talking and listening, and, inside their little Zoom squares, they went about their evening routines. A woman fried tortillas. A man wearing a gold chain hugged a Teddy bear. A woman brushed a girl’s hair. On the walls were portraits of Jesus, graduation photos, and finger paintings. The sun went down and lamps turned on. The apartments were neat and messy and nice and dingy, but they were all, for the moment, home. ♦

"['The Editors', 'The Editor']",2020-05-05,"Pam McCarthy, Champion of Change","Of the many things that we’ve missed in these bewildering weeks of homebound distancing, one is the ability to mark properly the joyful passages of life: births, graduations, weddings, anniversaries. A FaceTime toast or a Zoom-ed congratulations hardly feels sufficient, but, for now, in-person festivities must be deferred for safer, sunnier days. Here at The New Yorker, we had plans to celebrate the astonishing career of our dear friend and colleague Pamela Maffei McCarthy, who has been the magazine’s deputy editor since 1995, and who decided not long ago that the time had come to spend her days doing something new. It wasn’t easy for any of us to accept this news—no one is more respected or adored at One World Trade Center. And yet no one is more deserving of a next chapter. This is Pam’s last issue, and, while we’re keeping the champagne on ice for a little longer, we want to thank and celebrate her here.

In the earliest years of The New Yorker, Harold Ross, its founding editor, always said he was looking for a “Jesus”—someone who could keep his venture calm and steady, fending off crisis, bringing the good news. He never quite found that savior. In Pam McCarthy, The New Yorker finally got what Ross was searching for: here was someone who would find, shepherd, and protect every variety of talent, a diplomat who could quiet troubled waters, a businessperson who could multiply loaves and fishes. In no small measure, today’s New Yorker would not exist without her and the extraordinary people she found, put into place, and promoted. The building started the moment she arrived; now she leaves the magazine transformed, expanded, and healthy. She did it not only with editorial acuity and business savvy but with immense depth of character, kindness, and generosity.

Pam McCarthy started her career at Esquire, where, first as a proofreader and later as executive editor, she learned every skill that magazines demand, on and off the page. She learned how to make things sing and how to make things run. As Tina Brown’s managing editor at Vanity Fair, she became an essential figure in that title’s rebirth and flourishing. In “The Vanity Fair Diaries: 1983-1992,” Brown describes her as “miraculous,” arriving on the scene and, in no time at all, taking everything in hand: editorial debates, fact-checking disputes, restive egos, production snarls, budgetary headaches, legal quandaries.

When Brown succeeded Robert Gottlieb as the editor of The New Yorker, she brought Pam with her to help revitalize its pages with new writers and artists. The New Yorker entered the modern age gradually––and then, it seemed, all at once, adding a Web site, then a fuller Web site, podcasts, video, newsletters, a radio show. At each step, Pam championed change while making sure that our editorial soul remained true and our business prospects solid. And, even as she shouldered the countless details required to make The New Yorker sail straight, Pam, often on weekends, provided other editors with editorial counsel. Invariably, her suggestions were about fairness, discipline, and tone. She has deep confidence in the power of facts, and she is wary of the cheap shot, the flash of hyperbole, the rickety insinuation. “She protected our business—and that was a huge thing,” as one of us put it. “But her editorial protection was the thing I valued the most.”

Pam McCarthy made sure that we could achieve our greatest ambitions while managing to be a fair-minded, decent, and financially sustainable workplace. Filling a role that once seemed impossible, she has proved one of the most important and influential people to walk through the doors of The New Yorker since the place opened, in midtown, ninety-five years ago. We’ve long ceased to marvel at her ability to create calm from the stuff of crisis. Working miracles, as Ross knew, was always part of the job description. ♦",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/pam-mccarthy-champion-of-change

"['Helen Rosner', 'Helen Rosne']",2020-05-05,The Chefs Behind Contra and Wildair Reincarnate,"The other day, at around 6:45 p.m., an iPad lit up at Contrair, perhaps New York’s only brand-new restaurant. On it was takeout order 63627: one jerk chicken, one crab congee, one lamb birria. Contrair is run by Jeremiah Stone and Fabián von Hauske Valtierra, the chefs behind the Lower East Side tasting-menu spot Contra and Wildair, a natural-wine bar next door—well-loved restaurants that nail that rare hat trick of being impeccably cool, winningly laid-back, and culinarily thrilling. But at the beginning of April, with their dining rooms closed because of the coronavirus, and artful small plates far from people’s minds, Stone and von Hauske Valtierra decided that their gastronomic future lay, at least temporarily, in stews, grills, and braises, packaged to go. (Contrair’s portmanteau name doubles as a punning bit of gallows humor: “You might ask ‘Are you guys closed?’ ” Stone said, “and we can be, like, ‘Au Contrair! ’ ”)

Countless restaurants in New York have shifted, of late, to takeout and delivery, and many have changed their menus—but few have taken on entirely new identities. To Stone and von Hauske Valtierra, reincarnating as Contrair was an aesthetic decision as much as a practical one. “I ordered some takeout from a place that’s quite expensive, and it just looked sad,” Stone said. Rustic cooking travels better, he found. He ran a quality-control experiment, sending deliveries to friends (and to von Hauske Valtierra, who had spent the early weeks of the social-distancing era housebound with bronchitis); he’d take a “before” photo, and ask them to send him an “after.”

The worldly menu includes, from left to right, jerk chicken, azimuth tabouli, miso kale salad with grilled beets, golden-crab congee, and rice pudding. Photograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New Yorker

In the morning, four days a week, Stone and von Hauske Valtierra prep lunches for medical workers; in the afternoon, they turn their attention to Contrair. For order 63627, Stone placed a chicken leg—which had cured in salt for a day, then marinated in jerk spices for another—on the grill, where its skin would become crisp and dark around the sweet, smoky meat; it would be plated in a compostable clamshell with collards, squash, and pigeon peas. Another cook filled a paper bowl with rice, purple cabbage, chickpeas, cilantro, and thin slices of red onion, an eventual home for the velvet-tender lamb birria (which arrives separately, in its dark, savory broth), then filled a quart container with golden ladlefuls of congee, packed alongside fried wonton wrappers tossed with Old Bay seasoning.

Even in the best of times, restaurants run on razor-thin margins; right now, between revenue from Contrair and income from their hospital contract (paid for, philanthropically, by Verizon), Stone and von Hauske Valtierra barely break even. “We’re not squandering any resources,” Stone said. “André Soltner told me that if you crack twelve eggs, the amount you leave behind is basically an extra egg, so you should do this”—he swiped his thumb inside each cracked shell, scooping out any lingering whites. Rice left over from the previous day’s birria is repurposed for the congee; scallion ends, scraps from making congee, are charred and added to the marinade for the next day’s birria.

By 7:10, order 63627 was neatly bundled, the food packaged up with a rum cocktail of Stone’s invention, made with beet syrup and orange bitters; two bottles of wine (like many desperate restaurants, they’re selling off their cellar at near-cost prices); and two of von Hauske Valtierra’s marvellous dirt cups, cloudlike hazelnut pudding layered with praline and chocolate, garnished jauntily with Haribo gummies purchased from the still open bodega down the block.

At 7:15, a customer arrived to pick up her order. She stepped just inside the front door of the erstwhile Contra dining room, where three tables had been repurposed as a makeshift barricade. A wireless doorbell cued a staffer to slide the bagged order across the polished wood. Outside, Orchard Street was gloomy with evening shadows; the sidewalks, usually crowded with bons vivants waiting for tables, were empty. As she left, the customer sent brief arcs of light and snippets of sound onto the street. Then everything was quiet and dark again. (Entrées $14-$19.) ♦

Her long fingers reach for the sky, paused somewhere in the sign of the cross or summoning the Holy Ghost or calling on heaven’s angels to descend. For all that’s modern about this affliction and the trappings of the Rock Church drive-in service, the woman could almost be Mary at the foot of the crucifixion crying out in pain for her dead son, or Mary Magdalene outside the empty tomb, surprised by joy and raising her hands in bewilderment.
