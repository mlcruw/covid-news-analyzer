['David Smith'],2020-05-05,"Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000","Pence says federal agencies could take over response in coming weeks as Trump acknowledges ‘some people will be affected badly’

Donald Trump is preparing to wind down the White House coronavirus taskforce even as the US death toll has topped 70,000 and experts warn that the worst is yet to come.

Mike Pence, the vice-president and taskforce chair, said on Tuesday that coordination of the pandemic response could be transferred back to federal agencies in late May or early June.

But in the wake of a leaked internal White House report suggesting that the daily US death toll will climb to 3,000 per day by June, the move is likely to fuel concerns that Trump has all but abandoned a public health strategy in favour of economic imperatives.

“I’m not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,” Trump said during a trip to Arizona – a battleground state in the 2020 presidential election – on Tuesday. “But we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.”

In an interview with David Muir of ABC News on Tuesday evening, Trump was asked directly: “Do you believe it’s the reality we’re facing, that lives will be lost to reopen the country?”

The president said: “It’s possible there will be some because you won’t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is, but at the same time we’re going to practise social distancing, we’re going to be washing hands, we’re going to be doing a lot of the things that we’ve learned to do over the last period of time. And we have to get our country back.”

A prolonged shutdown, Trump added, came with its own costs in terms of increased drug use and suicide.

Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate, tweeted: “It appears the plan is, shamefully, to have no plan. Americans will suffer. We must replace this administration in November.”

David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama, added on Twitter: “If you can’t shut down the virus, shut down the taskforce.”

Pence was responding on Tuesday to questions about a New York Times report that said officials in the Trump administration were telling the 22 taskforce members and their staff to expect the group to be phased out within weeks.

“I think we’re starting to look at the Memorial Day [25 May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner,” the vice-president said, according to a pool report.

Pence insisted that “it really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country” and promised to keep the response coordinator, Deborah Birx, “around every bit as long as we need to”.

Birx herself said: “We’ll still keep a close eye on the data because we have very good data now. It took us a while to build that capacity. And we’ll make sure that, you know, we’re watching that at a federal level.”

But there was also immediate confusion. Even as Pence spoke, Anthony Fauci, a leading taskforce member, was denying the Times’s report. “That’s not true,” the infectious disease expert told CBS News. “I’ve been in every taskforce meeting, and that’s not what they are doing.”

The taskforce was created in late January and Pence was named as chairman in late February. It met frequently to address the rapidly spreading pandemic and then explained its work in nightly press briefings dominated by Trump that sometimes lasted more than two hours.

But the president was accused of using the platform to score political points, with Republican allies eventually warning that the briefings were damaging him at the polls.

After a briefing in which Trump floated the idea of treating the virus with disinfectant injections, the events were soon killed off. There has now been no briefing for more than a week and the taskforce is meeting less frequently.

Its demise would be the latest sign that the White House is pivoting towards the first phase of Trump’s plan to reopen the country after many states ordered people to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus. The president has urged supporters to “liberate” states from pandemic restrictions and signalled approval for armed protesters who have defied his own social distancing guidelines.

On Sunday, Trump held a Fox News virtual town hall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and was joined by Pence and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, putting an emphasis on the economy.

Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host whom Trump follows closely, applauded the winding up of the taskforce. “For too long it seemed like unelected doctors were making policy,” she tweeted. “Economic toll was disastrous.”

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, denied that health concerns were being neglected: “Reporting on the task force is being misconstrued to suggest the White House is no longer involving medical experts,” she tweeted. “This is totally false. President Trump will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening.”

But to critics, the timing is awry. On Monday, researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation almost doubled its previous US mortality model to more than 134,000 from 72,400 on 29 April. The change reflected “rising mobility in most US states” with an easing of business closures and stay-at-home orders expected in 31 states by 11 May, the institute said.

Fauci warned in a CNN interview on Monday that there would be a “rebound” of new coronavirus cases in the US if the country rushes towards a “premature” reopening of society and business. “How many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be some form of normality sooner rather than later?” he asked.

Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said any attempt to sideline Birx and Fauci was doomed. “He might try to marginalise them but the press isn’t going to try to marginalise them.

“They are the people with the data and with the expertise and nobody with data and expertise is going to be marginalised. It’s going to be the politicians who don’t listen to the scientists who are going to get marginalised.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/trump-coronavirus-taskforce-pence-us-death-toll

Donald Trump used his first cross-country trip since the pandemic began to visit an Arizona plant manufacturing medical masks, seeking to demonstrate America’s readiness to reopen the economy even as public health experts warned it was too soon.

His visit to the battleground state on Tuesday came as the White House signalled a desire to wind down the coronavirus taskforce in the coming weeks despite a continued threat from the virus.

“I’m not saying anything is perfect,” Trump told reporters in Arizona. “Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.”

During a tour of the Honeywell facility in Phoenix, which shifted from manufacturing aircraft engines to producing N95 respirator masks in response to the pandemic, Trump wore safety glasses but no mask. A sign at the entrance urged visitors to wear masks at all times, but a White House official said the company had informed them in advance that a mask was not required.

The visit is meant to underscore the administration’s efforts to nudge a cautious nation, still grappling with economic and public health disasters inflicted by the virus, to return to a more normal way of life. Trump has cheered moves by some governors to reopen their economies, despite a failure to meet guidelines for lifting safety restrictions issued by the White House and concern from public health officials that states are acting too quickly.

Despite Trump’s optimism, wide majorities of Americans oppose the reopening of businesses and restaurants. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll published on Tuesday found that 74% of Americans said they were opposed to reopening dine-in restaurants and nail salons in their states, while more than eight in 10 Americans said movie theaters should not be allowed to reopen in their states.

In Arizona, Trump praised the “phenomenal” work of the coronavirus taskforce, led by the vice-president, Mike Pence, but said it was time to focus on the next “phase”.

Trump was greeted on the tarmac in Phoenix by Arizona’s governor, Doug Ducey, a Republican who has been more cautious than some fellow GOP governors about reopening the state. This week he extended the state’s stay-at-home-order until 15 May with exceptions allowing salons, barbershops, businesses and restaurants to open in the coming days if they meet certain safety conditions.

While the number of infections in Arizona is declining, the Navajo Nation that crosses the northern part of the state remains one of the worst-affected areas in the country. As of Monday, 2,474 residents of the Navajo Nation have tested positive and 73 have died.

Before Trump’s visit, the treasury department announced that it would begin distributing $4.8bn in coronavirus relief allocated for Native American tribes, aid the tribal governments had to sue to obtain. Trump pledged $600m to help the Navajo Nation fight the pandemic during a roundtable with tribal leaders.

Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, said Trump had worsened the public health crisis by refusing to reopen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act amid the pandemic, which Ducey recommended.

“President Trump will try to paper over his administration’s failed response to the Covid-19 pandemic when he travels today to Arizona,” he said in a statement, “but nothing can cover up how he failed to prepare our country for this pandemic and his slow response.”

A political battleground in Arizona

Some of Trump’s most raucous rallies have been in Arizona, where he has a devoted base. But he has also alienated the state’s independent and moderate voters, while a growing Hispanic electorate and newcomers from states like California and Washington have also accelerated the state’s political diversity.

In 2016, he won the state by 3.5 percentage points, a much smaller margin than past Republican presidential candidates. Two years later, the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema beat Martha McSally in a Senate race to succeed the retiring Arizona senator Jeff Flake. McSally was then appointed to fill the seat of the late Arizona senator John McCain, and she is now locked in a fierce contest with the Democrat Mark Kelly to retain it.

The seat has been held by a Republican since Barry Goldwater was first elected to the Senate in 1968. But the race is now considered a “toss-up” by the non-partisan Cook Political report and recent polling shows McSally trailing Kelly.

“This year really could be a tipping point for Arizona politics,” said Chip Scutari, a political consultant in Phoenix. “And I’m sure President Trump and his team want to solidify Arizona in the win column but it’s really up for grabs.”

Scutari called Trump’s visit a “pseudo-campaign rally”; indeed, when the president finished speaking at the Honeywell facility the Rolling Stones’s You Can’t Always Get What You Want – a Trump rally staple – began to play.

Democrats are increasingly bullish on their prospects, buoyed by polls that show Biden leading in the state.

Felecia Rotellini, the chair of the Arizona Democratic party, called Trump’s visit to the state a “sign of desperation”.

“The Covid-19 crisis and the complete lack of empathy and competence that the president has shown in his handling of this has created even a greater sinking ship that is now called his re-election campaign,” Rotellini said.

The brief trip to Phoenix marks the beginning of what Trump hopes will be more frequent outings after being locked down in Washington for weeks, and as polling numbers show his support eroding in battleground states. The president has said he plans to travel soon to Ohio, New York and North Dakota for a Fourth of July fireworks display at Mount Rushmore. Though eager to get back on the campaign trail, Trump acknowledged in a town hall with Fox News on Sunday that his signature rallies were unlikely to return for several more months, at least.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-arizona-coronavirus-reopening

The Trump administration is poised to break up the White House coronavirus taskforce, the public face of the US response to the virus, even as experts warn that the worst is yet to come.

Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000 Read more

Here is what we know so far about the taskforce and where the US stands in its response to Covid-19.

What is the coronavirus taskforce?

Days after public health officials announced the first confirmed case of Covid-19 on US soil on 21 January, the White House announced that it had formed a taskforce that would lead the federal government’s response to the pandemic. The group, it said, would work together to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus in the US and keep the public informed about important public health and travel guidance.

By March, as the US reported thousands of new cases of Covid-19 every day, the taskforce gave daily press briefings, ostensibly to update Americans about the public health emergency.

But at the end of April, the briefings stopped. The last press conference was held on 24 April. According to reports, Trump’s advisers said his daily appearances were hurting his chance of re-election in November, especially after he suggested – with no evidence – that disinfectant could fight the virus in human bodies.

Who is on the taskforce?

Headed by Mike Pence, the taskforce is made up of members of Trump’s cabinet, including Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, and Steve Mnuchin, secretary of the treasury. There are also representatives from different departments, such as transportation and defense, and various advisers to the president.

Trump appointed two well-respected epidemiologists, Drs Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, to the taskforce. Both, though especially Fauci, have been widely regarded as the sober voices centered on public health, in contrast with the political figures on the taskforce.

What effect is Covid-19 having on public health in the US?

Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and released on Tuesday showed that the number of coronavirus deaths in the US had passed 70,000 – far more than any other country, and over a quarter of all coronavirus deaths in the world. As of Tuesday afternoon, the US had nearly 1.2m confirmed cases, one-third of the worldwide total.

The virus has had a devastating effect in communities across the US as hospital systems have become overwhelmed and struggled to get proper protective equipment and ventilators to help patients with the most serious cases.

A report thought to be from the White House (though the White House has denied ownership) said daily coronavirus deaths could reach 3,000 in the US by 1 June. The US is currently seeing between 1,000 and 2,000 deaths and between 20,000 and 30,000 new cases a day.

What effect has Covid-19 had on the US economy?

A majority of states issued stay-at-home orders, allowing only essential workers to go to work and keep their businesses open. This has resulted in a wave of unemployment throughout the US: more than 22 million people have filed for unemployment since the crisis began, a number likely to rise as states work through the backlog of applications.

Industries such as restaurants and travel have been decimated by shutdown orders with uncertainty over when, if ever, business will return to normal. Congress has passed a series of spending bills, the main one being a $2.2tn stimulus package in March, to try to mitigate the harm the virus has had on industries, hospitals and local governments.

As the economic fallout worsened, Trump has encouraged states to reopen, insisting that it is safe while also acknowledging the death toll is set to rise. Twenty-three states are beginning to reopen despite the warnings of the risks to public safety.

Meanwhile critics have accused Trump of effectively abandoning a public health strategy for the pandemic and showing “clear willingness to trade lives for the Dow Jones”.

Why is the White House ending the coronavirus taskforce?

Pence insisted that “it really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country”, despite data on the continuing public health risk.

Recently there has been some tension in messaging about the virus from key members of the group.

Fauci has cautioned that the US needs to have enough testing capacity to reopen safely, and is not yet at that stage. Fauci said the US will need to double its current level of testing within several weeks.

“I don’t think there’s a chance that this virus is just going to disappear,” he told National Geographic. “It’s going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge.”

But acknowledging that the US is still behind on testing does not chime with Trump’s messaging.

A leaked internal White House report predicts the daily death toll from the virus will reach about 3,000 on 1 June, almost double the current tally of about 1,750, the New York Times revealed on Monday.

Yet at the same time, Trump has scrapped daily coronavirus task force briefings and marginalized his medical experts in favour of economic officials flooding the airwaves to urge states to reopen for business – even amid rising infection rates.

On Tuesday morning, before boarding Air Force One to visit a medical mask-making facility in Arizona for his first long trip since late March when the outbreak escalated in the US, Trump weighed a predicted surge in deaths against economic revival.

“There is no great win, one way or the other, but I will tell you where there is a win, we are going to build a country, I did it once, two months ago we had the best economy in the history of the world, but we are going to do it again and that’s what we’re starting … it’s going to happen pretty fast.”

The top US public health expert on the White House coronavirus task force, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in a CNN interview the previous evening that there will be a “rebound” of new coronavirus cases in the US if the country rushes towards a “premature” reopening of society and business.

“How many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be some form of normality sooner rather than later?” he asked.

And on Tuesday morning New York governor Andrew Cuomo warned against what he called a life or death “trade-off” when planning how and when to lift restrictions.

“The faster we reopen the lower the economic costs, but the higher the human costs because the more lives lost. That, my friends, is the decision we are really making,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing.

Critics are now sharply questioning the Trump administration approach to what Fauci called “a very difficult choice” that weighs a death toll against economic catastrophe.

“They’ve decided in a very utilitarian kind of way that the political damage from a collapsed economy is greater than the political damage from losing as many as 90,000 more Americans just in June,” said Rick Wilson, a former Republican strategist. “We’re witnessing the full-scale application of a kind of grisly realpolitik that is a clear willingness to trade lives for the Dow Jones.”

In a sign of the shift, the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie told CNN that increased deaths could be worth it if the economy reopens. “Of course, everybody wants to save every life they can – but the question is, towards what end, ultimately?” said Christie, a Republican who led Donald Trump’s presidential transition team in 2016. He added: “Are there ways that we can … thread the needle here to allow that there are going to be deaths, and there are going to be deaths no matter what?”

When Trump declared a national emergency on 13 March, hopes rose that, for all the early downplaying and missed testing opportunities, the federal government was finally ready to attack the crisis with full force.

Trump quickly branded himself a “wartime president” and, on 31 March, somberly braced Americans for a “very, very painful two weeks” ahead. His daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefings earned comparisons with campaign rallies, sometimes running for more than two hours, but also featured respected experts, Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, armed with graphics and science.

On 23 April, however, Trump pontificated about injecting disinfectant into coronavirus patients, prompting worldwide disbelief and derision. The briefings would never be the same again and over the past week have been replaced by set-piece events touting an economic comeback.

On Sunday, tellingly, when Trump held a Fox News virtual town hall entitled “America Together: Returning to Work” at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, he was accompanied not by Birx and Fauci but Vice-President Mike Pence and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.

The president has been egged on by Fox News hosts who question whether the virus is any worse than the common flu, doubt the value of physical distancing and contend that the economic shutdown, which has cost at least 30m jobs, shows the cure is worse than the problem.

On Saturday, a Washington Post report suggested Trump had been encouraged to pivot from the health crisis to the economic fightback by an internal White House analysis that suggested the daily death toll would peak in mid-April then fall away significantly. His “decision-making has been guided largely by his re-election prospects”, the Post added.

But death toll predictions from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a model favored by the White House, were raised on Monday from 72,000 to 134,000 by the start of August because, it said, states are relaxing physical distancing too soon.

Now, critics say, Trump seems ready to shrug at the losses as collateral damage, paying greater heed to his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, than Birx or Fauci.

Wilson, author of Everything Trump Touches Dies, warned: “They may end up making the situation so bad with a second wave in the summer and a third wave in the fall that we end up with a much worse set of economic challenges than if we’d taken our bitter medicine and stayed shut down until we were through the early part of this crisis.”

The grim news remains inescapable but the administration hopes its economic message will offer at least some counter-programming.

Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, said: “Almost by necessity, they are changing their strategy. They are pinning all of their hopes on getting the economy reopened, using their economic spokespeople and hoping that the American public has a high toleration for the death count moving up. It sounds terrible to say and even worse to do.

“I think you won’t be seeing much from the scientists any more – the news is that bad – and they’re just going to turn a blind eye to the fact that what they’re doing is going to kill more people, because ultimately the way the president makes decisions is what’s good for his re-election.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-economic-recovery

['Michael Sainato'],2020-05-05,"Amazon is cracking down on protesters and organizing, workers say","Amazon’s revenues topped $33m an hour in the first three months of the year as the coronavirus pandemic locked down large parts of the world. The sales boost has handed Amazon the biggest dilemma of its 25-year life: how to deal with a growing chorus of critics within the company. So far its reaction has only made matters worse.

Last week an Amazon vice-president, Tim Bray, resigned in protest at what he called the company’s “chickenshit” decision to fire colleagues in the company’s warehouse division who had highlighted safety issues. “Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” wrote Bray.

Bray is just the latest, most highly paid, Amazon employee to speak out. Other critics have not had the luxury of resigning and some of those who remain say the company is actively trying to silence them.

The pushback on critics comes as both Democrats and Republicans are calling for investigations into Amazon’s dominance. The company may be winning the sales war during the pandemic but the aftermath looks set to be a different story.

John Hopkins has worked at Amazon DSF4 distribution center in San Leandro, California, for about six months. During the pandemic, Hopkins started distributing pamphlets with information about union organizing to co-workers and posting them on bulletin boards in the warehouse in response to safety concerns he has had about how Amazon has protected workers from coronavirus.

“No matter where I put them in the building they turn up missing shortly thereafter,” said Hopkins. “This is 100% about stifling the seeds of a union before it can grow roots.”

On 1 May, the same day Bray resigned, Hopkins filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Amazon over the consistent removal of the pamphlets, while other flyers, such as postings for third-party contractor Amazon delivery jobs are permitted. Hopkins said his inquiries about posting the flyers to human resources have received no response.

Hopkins clocked out of his shift at midnight on 1 May in solidarity with the sick-out protest held by Amazon workers around the US, but stayed in the break room after his shift to hand out pamphlets and talk to co-workers about organizing. When management asked him to leave, he did so after arguing it was within his rights to speak to workers about advocating for better working conditions.

“I explained that since I hadn’t yet received a response from HR regarding my pamphlets, I felt that this was the only way that I had left to coordinate with my colleagues. I asked if they would set a time to meet with me about my concerns, or let me know when I could expect a response from HR and they refused to engage but just told me that I had to leave,” said Hopkins.

When he returned to work on 2 May, he found out he was suspended “for violating a new policy that says we can only be on site for 15 minutes before or after our shift ends”, he said.

At least six Amazon workers who have participated in protests or vocally advocated for improvements to worker safety and conditions have been fired during the pandemic, and several other workers have reported facing disciplinary write-ups from Amazon after protesting.

On 10 April, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa were fired from their corporate roles at Amazon after their group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, organized a virtual event for warehouse workers to speak with tech workers about working conditions and Amazon’s response to the pandemic.

“Amazon has been trying for quite some time to get rid of Maren and I. We felt very strongly about continuing to speak up because of how high the stakes are,” said Cunningham, a user experience designer who worked at Amazon since 2013. “This is a time where we have to deeply care about one another. We’re both in the climate crisis and a global pandemic and if we can’t stand with each other now, then when do we?”

Cunningham and Costa, a principal user experience designer who worked at Amazon since 2002, have been among the most visible workers pushing Amazon to take action and enact meaningful policies to combat the climate crisis. They have previously faced threats of termination for speaking to the media.

“There seems to be a pattern of censoring, silencing and firing, across the nation, around the world, with Amazon choosing to silence workers who are standing up for safety, basic human rights instead of taking criticism as an opportunity to do better,” said Costa.

At Amazon warehouses, Chris Smalls and Gerald Bryson at JFK8 in Staten Island, New York, were terminated shortly after participating in protests outside the warehouse over working conditions and lack of safety protections as coronavirus cases continued to rise at Amazon warehouses around the US. Bashir Mohamed, an employee for three years at Amazon’s MSP1 warehouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was also fired after he was advocating for better protections and cleaning during the pandemic.

In leaked memos Amazon’s general counsel, David Zapolsky, called Smalls “not smart, or articulate” and argued the media’s focus on him would leave Amazon “in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how we’re trying to protect workers”. The company later apologized for the comments about Zapolsky, saying they were “personal and emotional” and born of frustration.

It is not only Amazon’s management who are frustrated. Courtney Bowden, 30, worked at an Amazon warehouse in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, for over two years before she was terminated on 30 March after being suspended for trying to provide a co-worker with a 24-hour dispatch hotline to report concerns with the shuttle service to the warehouse. She was previously vocal with management in asking for better safety protections for workers, such as adding more time clocks to promote social distancing, and paid time off for part-time workers.

“I had to file a charge with the NLRB because this whole incident stems from me trying to give somebody a telephone number for the shuttle bus company,” said Bowden. “Anybody who is outspoken about labor or safety issues, Amazon is retaliating against a lot of people at the moment. I was recently outspoken on two different occasions during the coronavirus and they chose to retaliate against me.”

An Amazon spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: “We respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so, but these rights do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, wellbeing or safety of their colleagues.” They added: “With over 1,000 sites around the world, and so many measures and precautions rapidly rolled out over the past several weeks across safety, pay, benefits and operational processes, there may be instances where we don’t get it perfect, but can assure you that’s just what they’ll be – exceptions.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/05/amazon-protests-union-organizing-cracking-down-workers
['John Mulholland'],2020-05-05,"On Giving Tuesday, stand with journalism that stands with science | John Mulholland","Relaying accurate information, in the normal course of events, is vital. Scrutinising government, in the normal course of events, is also vital. But these are not normal times. And our ability to carry out the functions of a news organisation is reliant on the financial resources that evidence-based reporting requires.

However, the Guardian, alongside many businesses, has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. Like many other news organisations, we are facing an unprecedented collapse in advertising revenues that further imperil the industry’s sustainability.

We rely to an ever-greater extent on our readers both for the moral force to continue doing journalism at a time like this and for the financial strength to facilitate that reporting.

And there has never been a greater need for that reporting. At a time when science and reason should be steering public policy, we see conjecture and instinct driving the US’s response. From touting untested hydroxychloroquine to suggesting ingesting bleach, the White House has ventilated anti-science. Drs Birx and Fauci have been all but silenced. Meanwhile, anti-vaxxers are storming state capitols and infiltrating the lockdown protests.

Science is fighting hard to be heard but the drumbeat of economic interests is drowning it out. The Guardian, however, will continue to give science a voice so that the US public can make informed decisions based on data, not dogma. Even as coronavirus cases rise across much of the country, the president has become the cheerleader-in-chief for reopening the states. Logic dictates we do otherwise but logic and reason are in short supply. And these decisions matter. It is critical that news organisations properly invigilate government policy and show how it shapes peoples’ lives – and their deaths. Without reader support, our ability to do so will be limited.

At a time like this, an independent news organisation that fights for data over dogma, and fact over fake, is essential

In our coverage to date, we have highlighted how this pandemic is disproportionately impacting people of color – both their health and economic wellbeing. African Americans have been dying in record numbers because they often live in polluted environments, have less access to healthcare and have more underlying conditions due to toxic stress. In economic terms, black and Hispanic Americans have been the hardest hit. This gives the lie to the so-called “booming economy”, which was already under-serving millions and millions of Americans. Race is never far from the surface of the country’s inequalities. With this pandemic, it is front and center.

And in our special project Lost on the Frontline, we have been determined to record the lives and deaths of frontline workers. Many of these workers are immigrants – even as this administration uses the pandemic to further its war on legal and illegal immigration.

As an outside news organisation headquartered in the UK, we can bring a different perspective to some of the more bizarre behaviors evident throughout the pandemic. In any other country, men armed with semi-automatic weapons storming government buildings would be referred to as “armed militias” or “extremists”. But here they are encouraged by the president. As Rashida Tlaib, the congresswoman from Michigan, said at the weekend: “Black people get executed by police for just existing, while white people dressed like militia members carrying assault weapons are allowed to threaten state legislators and staff.”

As we said, these are not normal times. And at a time like this, an independent news organisation that fights for data over dogma, and fact over fake, is not just optional. It is essential.

['Jonathan Watts'],2020-05-05,One billion people will live in insufferable heat within 50 years – study,"The human cost of the climate crisis will hit harder, wider and sooner than previously believed, according to a study that shows a billion people will either be displaced or forced to endure insufferable heat for every additional 1C rise in the global temperature.

In a worst-case scenario of accelerating emissions, areas currently home to a third of the world’s population will be as hot as the hottest parts of the Sahara within 50 years, the paper warns. Even in the most optimistic outlook, 1.2 billion people will fall outside the comfortable “climate niche” in which humans have thrived for at least 6,000 years.

The authors of the study said they were “floored” and “blown away” by the findings because they had not expected our species to be so vulnerable.

“The numbers are flabbergasting. I literally did a double take when I first saw them, ” Tim Lenton, of Exeter University, said. “I’ve previously studied climate tipping points, which are usually considered apocalyptic. But this hit home harder. This puts the threat in very human terms.”

There will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6,000 years

Instead of looking at climate change as a problem of physics or economics, the paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examines how it affects the human habitat.

The vast majority of humanity has always lived in regions where the average annual temperatures are around 6C (43F) to 28C (82F), which is ideal for human health and food production. But this sweet spot is shifting and shrinking as a result of manmade global heating, which drops more people into what the authors describe as “near unliveable” extremes.

Humanity is particularly sensitive because we are concentrated on land – which is warming faster than the oceans – and because most future population growth will be in already hot regions of Africa and Asia. As a result of these demographic factors, the average human will experience a temperature increase of 7.5C when global temperatures reach 3C, which is forecast towards the end of this century.

At that level, about 30% of the world’s population would live in extreme heat – defined as an average temperature of 29C (84F). These conditions are extremely rare outside the most scorched parts of the Sahara, but with global heating of 3C they are projected to envelop 1.2 billion people in India, 485 million in Nigeria and more than 100 million in each of Pakistan, Indonesia and Sudan.

This would add enormously to migration pressures and pose challenges to food production systems.

“I think it is fair to say that average temperatures over 29C are unliveable. You’d have to move or adapt. But there are limits to adaptation. If you have enough money and energy, you can use air conditioning and fly in food and then you might be OK. But that is not the case for most people,” said one of the lead authors of the study, Prof Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University.

An ecologist by training, Scheffer said the study started as a thought-experiment. He had previously studied the climate distribution of rainforests and savanna and wondered what the result would be if he applied the same methodology to humans. “We know that most creatures’ habitats are limited by temperature. For example, penguins are only found in cold water and corals only in warm water. But we did not expect humans to be so sensitive. We think of ourselves as very adaptable because we use clothes, heating and air conditioning. But, in fact, the vast majority of people live – and have always lived – inside a climate niche that is now moving as never before.”

We were blown away by the magnitude,” he said. “There will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6,000 years.”

The authors said their findings should spur policymakers to accelerate emission cuts and work together to cope with migration because each degree of warming that can be avoided will save a billion people from falling out of humanity’s climate niche.

“Clearly we will need a global approach to safeguard our children against the potentially enormous social tensions the projected change could invoke,” another of the authors, Xu Chi of Nanjing University, said.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/one-billion-people-will-live-in-insufferable-heat-within-50-years-study
['Patrick Greenfield'],2020-05-05,Conservation in crisis: ecotourism collapse threatens communities and wildlife,"From Kenya to the Seychelles, coronavirus has dealt a devastating blow to efforts to protect endangered wildlife

From the vast plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya to the delicate corals of the Aldabra atoll in the Seychelles, conservation work to protect some of the world’s most important ecosystems is facing crisis following a collapse in ecotourism during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Organisations that depend on visitors to fund projects for critically endangered species and rare habitats could be forced to close, according to wildlife NGOs, after border closures and worldwide travel restrictions abruptly halted millions of pounds of income from tourism.

Throughout the pandemic, scientists have repeatedly urged humanity to reset its relationship with nature or suffer worse outbreaks. But the economic consequences of the Covid-19 lockdown have raised fears of a surge in poaching, illegal fishing and deforestation in life-sustaining ecosystems, with tens of thousands of jobs in the ecotourism sector at risk around the world.

“It’s right that the global focus now is on protecting human lives in this devastating pandemic. However, in the places we work, we are already witnessing its economic impact, particularly in areas where communities rely heavily on ecotourism for their livelihoods,” said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF UK.

In Cambodia, three critically endangered giant ibis were killed for meat in early April following the collapse of the local tourism industry, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. In central Africa, measures to shield mountain gorillas from the virus have resulted in a slump in vital visitor revenue. Twelve rangers who guarded Virunga national park, where the gorillas live, were killed in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo last month.

“It could be years before these places can fully recover, increasing the risk that people come to rely on other activities to make a living, putting unsustainable pressure on natural resources,” Bartlett said. “Additionally it is currently much harder to monitor land grabbing and illegal poaching.”

While the poaching of rhinos, big cats and critically endangered species has continued during lockdown, a recent Wildlife Justice Commission report found the illegal wildlife trade had been severely disrupted by movement and travel restrictions.

But conservationists fear an explosion of illegal hunting if organisations are forced to lay off wildlife rangers and suspend surveillance programmes. Black rhinos in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, have been evacuated after at least six were killed by poachers in March.

Dickson Kaelo, chief executive officer at Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, said all bookings for this year’s key activities such as the wildebeest migration in the Masai Mara had been cancelled, prompting difficult choices about staff in Kenya’s conservancies.

“While elephant poaching may not escalate owing to the current suppression of international travel and negative sentiments against animal products in south-east Asia, demand for bushmeat will go up if there is nobody to monitor activities within the conservancies,” he said.

“Poaching for bushmeat already existed on a small scale even before the coronavirus outbreak. With more Kenyans out of work, bushmeat will be more appealing than meat sold by the licensed butcher. If the rangers have no salaries, how will they effectively monitor human activities in and out of the conservancies?”

Wildlife conservation in Kenya had already suffered a series of setbacks following a devastating locust invasion and a viral outbreak among livestock in the the Greater Mara conservation area. Kaelo said coronavirus will compound the effects on community-led wildlife conservation.

“Members of these communities may lose faith in wildlife conservation if there is no money forthcoming. In addition, people who live around these wildlife havens and looked forward to selling artefacts to tourists may resort to other income-generating activities such as farming, fuelling the never-ending human-wildlife conflicts as animals invade and destroy their new farms,” he said.

In Colombia, the big cat conservation organisation Panthera has recorded a spike in big cat poaching, with two jaguars, an ocelot and a puma killed in recent weeks. The organisation has experienced delays in funding during the pandemic.

While rangers are forced to stay at home, Dr Esteban Payán, director of the jaguar programme in the region, said he was concerned about illegal land grabbing and intentional wildfires.

“My worst fear post-pandemic is that once we go out, we’re going to find hectares and hectares of fenced-out new farmland where you don’t know who they are or what is happening. There’s rampant deforestation in Colombia right now in the Amazon.

“That worries me more than increased poaching. Why? Because of the scale, size and speed of deforestation and fires. That just destroys the habitat. And with the habitat, there go the jaguars. You might not see a bloody animal on the ground with a bullet in it but it’s worse because they’re either homeless and burned, burned alive or they don’t have any prey.”

Global Fishing Watch has recorded a substantial drop in fishing around the world, with fishing hours down nearly 10% from 11 March to the end of April compared with the past two years. But the drop in ecotourism has affected conservation of the world’s most precious marine ecosystems.

Dr Fanny Douvere, Unesco’s marine programme coordinator for 50 world heritage sites, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Galápagos Islands and the West Norwegian Fjords, warned of the consequences of the downturn.

“We need to be particularly worried about those sites that are heavily dependent on tourism revenues to finance some of their operations. In the Seychelles, for example, Aldabra atoll is not sure how it’s going to continue with its monitoring because it’s entirely financed by revenues from tourism,” she said.

“As soon as tourism revenues fall apart, a lot of sites cannot continue their conservation, or at least part of it.”

['Jack Losh'],2020-05-05,Conservation in crisis: why Covid-19 could push mountain gorillas back to the brink,"Once a step away from extinction, their survival was a rare success story. But groundbreaking gorilla conservation is now in peril

As he clambers down the forested ravine, soil slipping beneath his boots, Dr Fred Nizeyimana knows they are close. “I can smell them,” he says, just before the mountain gorillas come into view high in the canopy, plucking leaves and chomping on the vegetation. An adult female slides down a tree, a flash of black fur and elongated limb. More follow, with infants and juveniles in tow. A grunting silverback descends to join its family, the branches buckling beneath approximately 180kg (400lb) of iconic primate.

Then Nizeyimana, a specialist vet offering hands-on care in the wild, spots a remarkable scene. Ambling up the steep, wooded slope, another gorilla family has emerged from the valley floor. The first group look on, then head deeper into the primeval jungle of Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable national park – one of Africa’s most ancient habitats and home to almost half of the world’s mountain gorillas.

Such a close and well-populated encounter with one of humankind’s nearest relatives (witnessed before the Covid-19 pandemic) would have been inconceivable during the dark days of the early 1980s, when it was estimated that there were only 250 mountain gorillas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) Virunga national park, and around 100 thought to be in Bwindi. That all-time low prompted fears they would vanish by the end of the 20th century. Even in early 2018, the conservation status of these gorillas put them one step away from extinction.

Now, thanks to a far-reaching initiative, a recent census has revealed the number of known mountain gorillas has increased to 1,063 – taking them off the red list of critically endangered species. Amid climate chaos and unbridled habitat destruction, this is a momentous achievement, albeit one that could now be reversed by the coronavirus pandemic.

Coronavirus poses lethal threat to great apes, experts warn Read more

Experts who led the revival put their success down to engaging local communities, securing government support and promoting transnational collaboration, a three-pronged strategy that could offer beleaguered areas worldwide a roadmap to recovery.

Not any one country could have, on its own, been responsible for the recovery Anna Behm Masozera, IGCP

“When done well, this can be a phenomenal success,” says Dr Timothy Tear, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Africa programme, which has been involved in the decades-long campaign to save the mountain gorilla. “We need to be recognising there are many more opportunities to do things like this in other countries.”

Environmentalists stress the importance of giving local communities a stake in the survival of the local area, ensuring they profit from ecotourism and other money-making activities that provide alternatives to hunting and resource exploitation. These income streams can fuel a country’s economic vitality, winning state support by helping to assert the animals’ worth to policymakers in capitals far from wilderness areas.

“The revenue that mountain gorillas produce is a major reason why governments are valuing this resource,” says Tear.

Permits to visit gorillas for one hour start at $600 (£479) per person in Uganda, rising to $1,500 in Rwanda. These sums are eye-watering, but crucial. Worldwide, up to $400bn a year is needed to conserve healthy ecosystems, a Credit Suisse report estimates, a long way from the $52bn actually raised.

Mountain gorilla habitats span Rwanda, Uganda and the war-wracked DRC, so partnerships unconstrained by political frontiers are essential. Such “conservation diplomacy” played out in 2015 when the three countries signed a treaty committing to coordinate the conservation of the region.

“Not any one country could have, on its own, been responsible for the recovery,” says Anna Behm Masozera, director of the IGCP, a regional coalition of environmental groups.

If this continues, it’s definitely going to reverse the achievements. There’s no doubt about it Bashir Hangi, Uganda Wildlife Authority

But serious threats remain, from irresponsible development to climate change – and now Covid-19.

Our simian ancestors share about 98% of human DNA and can catch respiratory diseases from people, with deadly consequences. Leading scientists warned last month that Covid-19 poses an “existential threat” to primates and that, for mountain gorillas in particular, the introduction of a new, highly-infectious disease could be a “potential extinction-level event”. In response, rangers in Bwindi are now required to wear face masks, use hand sanitiser and keep their distance from the apes.

The suspension of ecotourism during the coronavirus pandemic has also meant the main source of revenue for gorilla conservation has been lost and there are fears some of those in surrounding communities who depend on tourists could turn to poaching out of desperation. “We are worried,” says Bashir Hangi, a spokesman for the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the state body that manages Bwindi and nine other national parks. “If this continues, it’s definitely going to reverse the achievements. There’s no doubt about it.”

Back from the brink

Ever since a young military officer named Oscar von Beringe discovered mountain gorillas (then promptly shot two of them) in 1902, these magnificent mammals have endured persecution. Disease, hunting and habitat destruction have blighted their two populations, split between Bwindi in Uganda and the Virunga range of extinct volcanoes that straddle DRC, Rwanda and Uganda.

It was in 1979 that conservation groups first started collaborating to protect the dwindling population, founding the Mountain Gorilla Project to run tourism and education initiatives to change local attitudes. But gorilla numbers continued to drop, whether they were dying in traps intended for antelope, or being killed in retaliation for raiding crops. Grisly trinkets made from their hands and heads were sold in tourist markets.

The legendary primatologist Dian Fossey began using uncompromising methods to pull these critically-endangered creatures back from the brink, from repelling herders by spray-painting cattle to directly confronting poachers, many of whom were impoverished locals with few options.

In 1985, a few weeks before her 54th birthday, Fossey was murdered in Rwanda. Her killers were never found. Shortly before her murder, Fossey had said she feared there would be no mountain gorillas left within 15 years.

But a census one year after her death revealed the opposite; numbers were increasing. “There was a glimmer of success,” says Behm Masozera, the IGCP’s director. “In order to sustain that success, a more cohesive programme was built around it.”

This resulted in the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) – a coalition of nonprofits comprising Conservation International, Fauna & Flora International and WWF that was more formalised than the Mountain Gorilla Project, with a remit across DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. This long-term alliance, argues one member, should be replicated elsewhere. “This is entirely the way we need to be working,” says Cath Lawson, regional conservation manager for Africa at WWF-UK, “to have that transformational change for wildlife like mountain gorillas to thrive.”

In 2003, despite DRC’s protracted conflict and the earlier horrors of the Rwandan genocide, sustained efforts had increased Virunga’s population to 380. An additional 320 in the cloud forests of Bwindi brought the total population to 700 individuals. The upward trajectory continued, propelled by 2015’s intergovernmental treaty. Snares, fashioned from ropes or wires that cut deep into gorilla flesh, began to disappear.

By November 2018 the number of known mountain gorillas reached 1,063. But there is no room for complacency. “Yes, this demonstrates what we can achieve,” says Lawson. “But it’s not a done deal.”

Ecotourism has played a central role in this conservation triumph, alongside a scheme that splits the revenue with nearby communities, adapting earlier divisive models of “fortress conservation” into something more inclusive and equitable.

Undeniably, though, coercive methods to protect wildlife have devastated traditional life for Batwa “pygmies”, a forest-dependent indigenous minority who were evicted in their thousands from Bwindi and other Ugandan parks as protection activities ramped up in the early 1990s and continue to suffer today.

Yet other local communities hail the Bwindi project – and its pragmatic fusion of wealth creation with environmentalism – as a genuine gain.

The Change A Life Bwindi charity trains former poachers in beekeeping, mothers in basket weaving, and teenage girls unable to afford school in tailoring. These income-generating activities emphasise the advantages of living near a thriving gorilla population to which cash-rich westerners are drawn daily.

“We see Bwindi as a good thing,” says Hilda Ariho, a 30-year-old community leader. “It brings tourists here and without it we’d be poorer. It’s helping a lot of women.”

Back inside the park, after Nizeyimana spots the two gorilla families, a group of tourists have one hour to absorb the scene, whether by taking a slew of selfies or observing in quiet contemplation.

The tourists depart and the silverback reclines, watching over his relatives in a mountainous landscape that for approximately 25,000 years has woven itself into an awe-inspiring tangle of vines, trunks and creepers across the Albertine Rift valley.

Conservationists are hoping that these mountain gorillas continue to thrive and that the latest threat, Covid-19, can be beaten.

"['Alastair Gee', 'Dani Anguiano']",2020-05-05,"We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back | Alastair Gee, Dani Anguiano","About 12,000 years ago, human domestication of the natural world began in earnest with the intentional cultivation of wild plants and animals. Fast forward to today and our dominion over the planet appears complete, as 7.8 billion of us multiply across its surface and our reach extends from the deep-sea beds, which are being mined, to the heavens, where we are, according to Donald Trump, dispatching a space force.

Yet as has been made clear by a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticated. Indeed, our interference with the natural world is making them more liable to flare up into tragedy. We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back.

'It sounded evil': inside the eerie moment California’s deadliest wildfire began Read more

Covid-19 appears to have emerged in a Wuhan seafood and wild animal market, yet some scientists argue that its true origin story lies in the disruption of ecosystems. Genetic testing indicates that the virus probably came from bats, and at some point may have been transmitted via an intermediate species such as the pangolin, the most trafficked animal in the world. Although pangolins were not – officially – listed as traded at the market, it was certainly host to other wild animals such as wolf pups, crocodiles and civets.

“Wild animals carry their own unique viruses,” David Quammen, the author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, told Yale Environment 360. “When we go into a tropical forest with its great diversity, and we start cutting down trees, and capturing animals, or killing animals for food” – or sending them to markets where they can mix with farm animals and humans – “then we offer those viruses the opportunity to become our viruses, to jump into us and find a new host, a much more abundant host”.

The risk of diseases spreading from animals to humans is in fact greatest when the animals concerned are endangered and in decline owing to trafficking and habitat destruction, a recent study found. The climate crisis and human population growth are “disease amplifiers”, according to the World Health Organization.

We know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, biodiversity destruction, political instability

Wildfires similarly show how our remaking of the natural world has had disastrous consequences. In our new book Fire in Paradise, which is based on our extensive reporting for the Guardian and published today, we document the destruction of an entire California city in 2018 by a fire of unprecedented severity in modern times. Claiming 85 lives, it is the deadliest ever wildfire in the state.

Wildfires are native to the western US in the same way that monsoons or hurricanes are native to other places. Yet a century of efforts to stamp them out and protect human lives and property in California has left the state’s forests and grasslands unnaturally dense with flammable vegetation that would otherwise have burned off in semi-regular but low-intensity burns. To make matters worse, global heating is rendering California’s wild places ever drier.

Paradise’s residents knew of the sword that hung over their heads. The town had an evacuation plan and an emergency robocall system. In the summer of 2018, a horrifying and awe-inspiring fire tornado 1,000ft wide had laid waste to an area just 80 miles away. “It’s not a matter of if,” one longtime resident, Iris Natividad, told us. “It’s a matter of when.”

Even so, no one imagined how bad it would be on that morning in early November, when a spark from a PG&E transmission tower ignited the brush that surrounded it, at one point consuming nearly 400 American football fields’ worth of vegetation a minute on its sprint into Paradise. Flames that burned as hot as a crematorium melted cars and blowtorched thousands of homes. The fire trapped people in town and caught many unaware.

Paradise suffered total devastation, and the images of neighborhoods reduced to nothing but piles of ash shocked the world.

We’d say this was the new normal – except that actually “it would be a mistake to assume that the region has reached any semblance of a stable plateau”, three wildfire scientists wrote for the Guardian only a few months before the Paradise fire. We know there will continue to be huge fires. We also know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, biodiversity destruction, political instability, and expanded ranges for mosquitoes and ticks.

Yet one optimistic lesson from the Covid-19 tragedy is that we can act. We will heed the calls to stay home, and we will condemn the economy in the process, if it means saving lives. And we will do it overnight.

On our part-domesticated, still-wild planet, in the geologic era that bears our name, we’ve learned that we do indeed possess the willpower to prevent another pandemic, and another Paradise.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/we-created-the-anthropocene-and-the-anthropocene-is-biting-back

The ad riffs on former president Ronald Reagan’s classic 1984 re-election ad, Morning in America, a one-minute commercial where young Americans get married, buy a home and raise the flag.

Bioluminescent waves dazzle surfers in California: 'Never seen anything like it'

Mother nature has provided a radical gift to nighttime beach-goers in southern California, in the form of bioluminescent waves that crash and froth with an otherworldly light.

California eases Covid-19 restrictions, allowing some businesses to reopen Read more

The event occurs every few years along the coast of southern California, though locals say this year’s sea sparkle is especially vibrant, possibly related to historic rains that soaked the region and generated algal bloom.

For some, this year’s light show was especially meaningful, coming just as beaches began to reopen after an almost month-long closure due to coronavirus.

Dale Huntington, a 37-year-old pastor at a church in south-eastern San Diego, got up at 3am after beaches reopened to surf the iridescent waves.

“I’ve been surfing for 20 years now, and I’ve never seen anything like it”, Huntington said.

The neon waves owe their color to blooming microscopic plants called phytoplankton. By day, the organisms collect on the water’s surface to give the water a reddish-brown hue, known as the red tide. By night, the algae put on a light show, dazzling most brightly in turbulent waters.

One photographer off the coast of Newport Beach, where crowds in recent weeks have protested against closures, recorded a dolphin jetting through bioluminescence like a sea spectre.

The phosphorescent display has captured the attention of locals in southern California, with many emerging from shelter-in-place restrictions to catch a glimpse of the surreal scenery.

One San Diegan, who lives in a neighborhood along the coast, implored local officials to restrict access to the beach, complaining that the red tide has drawn large crowds comparable to a “Fourth of July on steroids”.

For surfers like Huntington, the spectacle has provided joy and relief amid the challenges of the pandemic. “My favorite part was paddling out – it was almost like there was a glow stick around your hand,” he described. “My board left a bioluminescent wake. There were a few of us out there and we were giggling, grown men shouting ‘this is so cool’ and splashing around like kids in the bathtub.”

Swimming, surfing, kayaking and paddleboarding are allowed under San Diego’s recently amended shelter-in-place restrictions.

Red tides, which stretch from Baja California up the coast to Los Angeles, have been observed since the early 1900s and can last from a few days to a couple of months. Scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, who study the phenomenon, say the glow shows are most lively at least two hours after sunset.

Scientists don’t know exactly how long this year’s red tide will last, but for Huntington, this year’s light show was doubly welcome.

A federal judge has reinstated New York’s June Democratic presidential primary, siding with Andrew Yang, the former candidate, who sued the state in federal court and called the recent decision to cancel the contest “authoritarian and illegal”.

The judge ruled Tuesday that the state had wrongfully removed the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Yang and eight other former presidential candidates from the ballot.

The decision came after two Democrats on the state’s election commission cancelled the presidential primary last week, relying on a new budget provision allowing them to remove presidential candidates who suspended their campaigns. The move outraged Sanders supporters and other progressives who said New York, a Democratic bastion, was actively disenfranchising voters.

“It goes against what the party stands for,” said Heather Key, who volunteered for the Sanders campaign. “They’re always on the case about gerrymandering and cheating with the GOP. And yet here they are controlling whether we can vote for the president for our choosing.”

The US district judge Analisa Torres wrote that the state had deprived voters of their constitutional guarantee of freedom of association. New York voters, she said, weren’t just voting for a presidential candidate, but also for delegates who could influence the direction of the Democratic National Convention in August. (Sanders and Biden announced an agreement last month to let Sanders keep hundreds of delegates, and make sure the senator is represented at the Democratic national convention.)

“The removal of presidential contenders from the primary ballot not only deprived those candidates of the chance to garner votes for the Democratic party’s nomination…it deprived Democratic voters of the opportunity to elect delegates who could push their point of view in that forum.”

Election officials had argued that holding a largely symbolic presidential primary would be costly and put people’s health at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. In Wisconsin and Florida, poll workers and voters tested positive for Covid-19 after election day. “[T]he holding of a presidential primary could strain the system to the point of buckling,” Robert Brehm, the co-executive director of the New York State Board of Elections, wrote in a court filing.

But Torres noted that the state was encouraging voters to vote by mail and doubted that cancelling the presidential primary entirely would significantly stop the spread of Covid-19. (A spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections declined to comment on the ruling, saying lawyers were reviewing it.)

Before Tuesday’s decision, Sanders supporters said the cancellation amounted to a stunning episode of voter suppression from Democrats at a time when the party is making expanding voting rights a core part of its platform. “It’s an insult to us,” said Habiba Choudhary, who had been canvassing for the senator.

But New York has long placed severe restrictions on voting, despite its reputation as one of the most progressive states in the US. The state had one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the 2016 election.

Biden is unlikely to lose New York and its 29 electoral college votes in November. But not giving Sanders supporters the chance to cast even a symbolic vote for him would have left his supporters unmotivated to commit to organizing for Biden, said Melanie D’Arrigo, who is running in a Democratic congressional primary in June.

“Will those voters knock doors, will those voters make calls, will those voters advocate on behalf of Joe Biden? I don’t know,” she said.

Some voters, such as Key, had also considered not voting in the general election at all.

It’s possible the back and forth of the election commission could still cause confusion. The cancellation would have meant that 35 of New York’s 62 counties will have a reduction in the number of voters who have primaries, and seven counties wouldn’t have had a primary at all. Campaigns have been relying on text messaging and email campaigns to keep people informed.

“It’s uncanny how many people think the next election is in November now,” said Jabari Brisport, a Democrat who is running in a primary for a state senate seat in Brooklyn.

There’s more at stake than the presidential primary in New York. New York has become home to a wave of progressive politicians, most notable Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Brisport said botching the primary would make it harder to replicate that success.

“A lot of progressive challengers like myself see this a direct attempt to protect incumbents,” he said of the previously cancelled presidential primary.

With just a few months until the Democratic conventions, Rachel Himes, an organizer with the Democratic Socialists of America who canvassed for Sanders, said New York voters deserve to have their voices heard.

“The principle of democracy is such that even when it seems like the election is a foregone conclusion, everyone should be able to vote,” said Himes. “People don’t have investment in the process, and why would they?”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/new-york-presidential-primary-cancelled-judge
[],2020-05-05,Trump administration drafts pact for mining on the moon,"The Trump administration is drafting a legal blueprint for mining on the moon under a new US-sponsored international agreement called the Artemis Accords, according to people familiar with the proposed pact.

The agreement would be the latest effort to cultivate allies around Nasa’s plan to put humans and space stations on the moon within the next decade, and comes as the civilian space agency plays a growing role in implementing American foreign policy. The draft pact has not been formally shared with US allies yet.

The Trump administration and other spacefaring countries see the moon as a key strategic asset in outer space. The moon also has value for long-term scientific research that could enable future missions to Mars – activities that fall under a regime of international space law widely viewed as outdated.

The Artemis Accords, named after the Nasa’s new Artemis moon program, propose “safety zones” that would surround future moon bases to prevent damage or interference from rival countries or companies operating in close proximity.

The pact also aims to provide a framework under international law for companies to own the resources they mine, the sources said.

In the coming weeks, US officials plan to formally negotiate the accords with space partners such as Canada, Japan, and European countries, as well as the United Arab Emirates, opening talks with countries the Trump administration sees as having “like-minded” interests in lunar mining.

Russia, a major partner with Nasa on the International Space Station, will not be an early partner in these accords, the sources said, as the Pentagon increasingly views Moscow as hostile for making “threatening” satellite maneuvers toward US spy satellites in Earth orbit.

The United States is a member of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and sees the “safety zones” as an implementation of one of its highly debated articles. It states that celestial bodies and the moon are “not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”

“This isn’t some territorial claim,” said one source, who requested anonymity to discuss the agreement. The safety zones, whose size would vary depending on the operation, would allow for coordination between space actors without technically claiming territory as sovereign, he said.

“The idea is if you are going to be coming near someone’s operations, and they’ve declared safety zones around it, then you need to reach out to them in advance, consult and figure out how you can do that safely for everyone.”

The Artemis Accords are part of the Trump administration’s plan to forgo the treaty process at the United Nations and instead reach agreement with “like-minded nations”, partly because a treaty process would take too long and working with non-spacefaring states would be unproductive, a senior administration official told Reuters.

As countries increasingly treat space as a new military domain, the US-led agreement is also emblematic of Nasa’s growing role as a tool of American diplomacy and is expected to stoke controversy among Washington’s space rivals such as China.

“Nasa’s all about science and technology and discovery, which are critically important, but I think less salient is the idea that Nasa is a tool of diplomacy,” Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said Tuesday.

Nasa is investing tens of billions of dollars into the Artemis program, which calls for putting humans on the moon by 2024 and building up a “sustainable presence” on the lunar south pole thereafter, with private companies mining lunar rocks and subsurface water that can be converted to rocket fuel.

The United States enacted a law in 2015 granting companies the property rights to resources they mine in outer space, but no such laws exist in the international community.

Joanne Gabrynowicz, editor-in-chief emerita of the Journal of Space Law, said an international agreement must come before staking out “some kind of exclusive area for science or for whatever reason”.

“It is not anything any nation can do unilaterally and still have it be legal,” she said.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/05/trump-mining-moon-us-artemis-accords

The coronavirus pandemic has cost Walt Disney $1.4bn in the last three months as the virus shut down its theme parks around the world and halted film and TV productions, the company announced on Tuesday.

The world’s largest media company said its operating income for the three months ending 28 March had fallen 37% to $2.4bn after it was forced to close parks, cancel cruises and delay future productions.

Disney felt the impact of the pandemic earlier than many US companies. It closed its parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong in January and its outpost in Japan in February before closing resorts in the US and Europe a month later.

The company estimates it lost $1bn over the three months in its parks, experiences and products segment, mostly due to revenue lost because of closures.

Disney+, the company’s new streaming service, however, has benefitted from the global quarantines imposed to slow the virus. Disney+ had 33.5 million paid subscribers by the end of March and passed the 50 million mark in April as more people stayed home and signed up.

On a call with financial analysts, the chief executive, Bob Chapek, said the company is “seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some sense of normalcy in China” and would reopen its Shanghai Disneyland park on 11 May with a phased approach.

Chapek said Disney would put new procedures in place at its parks once they reopen, including limiting guest capacity, temperature checks and masks.

Disney’s stock hit at an all-time high before the pandemic. In 2019, a record seven Disney movies brought in more than $1bn each including Avengers: Endgame, Frozen II and The Lion King.

['Robert Tait'],2020-05-05,Prague revamp reveals Jewish gravestones used to pave streets,"Dozens of paving stones made from Jewish headstones have been found during redevelopment work in Prague’s tourist district, confirming speculation that the former communist regime raided synagogues and graveyards for building materials.

Tuesday’s discovery came in the opening phase of a £10.6m facelift project in the city’s landmark Wenceslas Square, scene of the some of the Czech Republic’s most dramatic historic events and a frequent site of political protest.

Rabbi Chaim Kočí, a senior official with the Prague rabbinate, witnessed workers unearthing cobblestones whose undersides revealed Hebrew lettering, the star of David and deceased dates. Other stones were blank but had polished surfaces that indicated they had also been taken from cemeteries.

Jewish leaders hailed the unearthing as proof of long-held suspicions that the communist authorities – who ruled the former Czechoslovakia for more than four decades during the cold war – had taken stonework from Jewish burial sites for a much-vaunted pedestrianisation of Wenceslas Square during the 1980s.

The flagship project was showcased during a walkabout tour by the-then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987.

Suspicions that some of its stonework may have been from a cemetery were first raised by the director of Prague’s Jewish museum, Leo Pavlat, who recalled finding two paving stones with headstone markings when work on the original scheme was taking place. His comments prompted Prague city council to agree to allow the Jewish community to inspect the site once the latest redevelopment started.

“We feel this is a victory for us because until now this was just a rumour. Maybe there were Jewish stones here, but nobody knew,” said Kočí, who had been at Wenceslas Square since early morning to witness the stones being dug up. “It’s important because it’s a matter of truth.

“We are making something right for the historical record. These are stones from the graves of people who were dead for maybe 100 years and now they are lying here. It’s not nice.”

The names of the dead are unidentifiable because the headstones have been broken to form cobblestones. One person appears to have died in 1877, when Prague was part of the Habsburg empire, while the most recent death is shown to have happened in the 1970s, during the height of communism.

The stones appear to have been taken from different cemeteries.

Community leaders plan to gather them to form a memorial at Prague’s old Jewish cemetery in the city’s Žižkov district, part of which was desecrated during the communist era to build a public park and subsequently to construct a massive television tower.

Synagogues and cemeteries were allowed to fall into disrepair under an officially sanctioned hostile policy towards religious institutions in general and Judaism in particular, making them vulnerable to looting.

František Bányai, the chairman of Prague’s Jewish community, said the discovery made him angry at the communist regime.

“More Jewish synagogues were destroyed in the area of the current Czech Republic during communist times than under the Nazis,” he said. “It was because of their special approach to religion. Anti-Judaism was official policy and all the Jewish committees were supervised and managed by control of the secret police. To be Jewish was negative from any point of view – but it was the same for the Christian church.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/prague-revamp-reveals-jewish-gravestones-used-to-pave-streets
['Julia Carrie Wong'],2020-05-05,California sues Uber and Lyft for misclassifying drivers as contractors,"California is suing Uber and Lyft, alleging they misclassified their drivers as independent contractors under the state’s new labor law, in the most significant challenge to the ride-hailing companies’ employment model to date.

Xavier Becerra, the state’s attorney general, announced the lawsuit Tuesday during a news conference. The labor law, known as AB5 and considered the nation’s strictest test, took effect on 1 January and makes it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors instead of employees who are entitled to minimum wage and benefits such as workers compensation and unemployment benefits – a key exclusion that has come to the fore during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Uber and Lyft claim their drivers aren’t engaged in the companies’ core mission and cannot qualify for benefits,” said Becerra. “These companies will take the workers’ labor, but they won’t accept the worker protections. California has ground rules with rights and protections for workers and their employers. We intend to make sure that Uber and Lyft play by the rules.”

The dispute over the employment status of Uber and Lyft drivers is as old as the companies themselves. Over the years, gig economy companies have attracted – and largely fought off or settled – a host of class-action lawsuits over employee classification. But an enforcement lawsuit by the state, which will not have the same incentive to settle as a private plaintiff’s attorney, represents an “unprecedented” escalation that is much more likely to bring about meaningful change, said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California Hastings who researches the gig economy.

“These companies should have never been allowed to proliferate using the business model they were using, and it was the state of California that first legalized and allowed this, so that it’s the state of California that is finally stepping in and saying that these are employees is so gratifying,” Dubal said in an interview.

California represents Uber and Lyft’s largest source of revenue. The companies, as well as Doordash, have invested $30m apiece in a ballot initiative campaign to exclude their drivers from the law while giving new benefits such as health care coverage. The initiative is likely to qualify for the November ballot.

The ballot initiative campaign was the subject of a scathing reference in the legal complaint filed by the state, which lambasted the companies for launching “an aggressive public relations campaign in the hopes of enshrining their ability to mistreat their workers” in the middle of “a once-in-a-century pandemic”.

A federal judge in February denied Uber and Postmates’ request for a preliminary injunction that would have exempted them from the law. But separately, a federal judge in January indefinitely blocked the law from applying to more than 70,000 independent truckers, deciding that it is preempted by federal rules on interstate commerce.

The state legislature is also considering amending the law, though lawmakers are split whether to broaden or narrow it as other groups – such as freelance writers and photographers – contend they have been hurt by it through unintended consequences.

The state’s lawsuit alleges that Uber and Lyft haven’t paid enough payroll taxes as a result of the misclassification. The suit seeks restitution for unpaid wages owed to drivers, civil penalties and a permanent ruling that would prohibit the companies from misclassifying drivers in the future.

“We are looking forward to working with the attorney general and mayors across the state to bring all the benefits of California’s innovation economy to as many workers as possible, especially during this time when the creation of good jobs with access to affordable healthcare and other benefits is more important than ever,” Lyft said in a statement.

“At a time when California’s economy is in crisis with four million people out of work, we need to make it easier, not harder, for people to quickly start earning,” a spokesman for Uber said in a statement. “We will contest this action in court, while at the same time pushing to raise the standard of independent work for drivers in California, including with guaranteed minimum earnings and new benefits.”

['Joan E Greve'],2020-05-05,Ousted US government scientist files whistleblower complaint over Covid-19 concerns,"Rick Bright says he was reassigned to lesser role because he resisted pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine

A US government scientist has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was ousted from his position after raising concerns that the Trump administration wanted to “flood” coronavirus hotspots like New York and New Jersey with a malaria drug that Donald Trump was pushing despite scant scientific evidence it helped.

Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, filed the complaint on Tuesday with the Office of Special Counsel, a government agency responsible for whistleblower complaints. He alleges he was reassigned to a lesser role because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug favored by the president.

Bright also said the Trump administration rejected his warnings on Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Bright said he “acted with urgency” to address the growing spread of Covid-19 after the World Health Organization issued a warning in January.

He said he “encountered resistance from HHS leadership, including health and human services secretary [Alex] Azar, who appeared intent on downplaying this catastrophic event”.

Bright alleges in the complaint that political appointees at the Department of Health and Human Services had tried to promote hydroxychloroquine “as a panacea”. The officials also “demanded that New York and New Jersey be ‘flooded’ with these drugs, which were imported from factories in Pakistan and India that had not been inspected by the FDA”, the complaint says.

But Bright opposed broad use of the drug. He felt an urgent need to tell the public that there wasn’t enough scientific evidence to support using the drugs for Covid-19 patients, the complaint states.

In a statement issued late last month, Bright said: “While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.”

Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration warned doctors against prescribing the drug except in hospitals and research studies. In an alert, regulators flagged reports of sometimes fatal heart-related side-effects among coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine or the related drug chloroquine.

The decades-old drugs, also prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause a number of side-effects, including heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.

['Julian Borger'],2020-05-05,Trump loyalist set to become national intelligence director on second attempt,"A Trump loyalist nominated as director of national intelligence (DNI) looked set to sail through Senate confirmation hearings on Tuesday, only nine months after being forced to withdraw for having exaggerated his security experience.

John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman who fiercely defended the president in last year’s impeachment hearings, told the Senate intelligence committee that he would speak truth to power if confirmed as DNI.

Ratcliffe was reminded by Democratic senators that his two predecessors had been forced from their posts because the findings of the intelligence community irritated Donald Trump, and that the spy agencies were currently under pressure to provide evidence for Trump’s claim that the coronavirus outbreak started in a Chinese laboratory.

“Regardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I will provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,” Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks at his confirmation hearing, held under social distancing rules, with most of the senators and staff wearing masks. “Above all, my fidelity and loyalty will always be to the constitution and rule of law, and my actions as DNI will reflect that commitment.”

However Ratcliffe, a fiercely partisan congressman, dodged questions on which Trump has broken with his own intelligence briefers, such as whether there has been any progress towards North Korean disarmament (there has not) and whether Iran was in compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal when Trump pulled the US out of the agreement (it was).

Ratcliffe said that if confirmed, he would focus on the impact of coronavirus, questions about its origins in China and US competition with Beijing.

“I view China as the greatest threat actor right now,” he said. “Look with respect to Covid-19 and the role China plays; the race to 5G; cybersecurity issues: all roads lead to China,” he told the panel.

Ratcliffe withdrew his first nomination five days after Trump first named him as a candidate – to widespread surprise – last July, after it was found he had grossly overstated his national security experience.

He had falsely claimed on his website to have “arrested over 300 illegal immigrants in a single day” and had “put terrorists in prison” although he had not tried a terrorism case in his time as a US attorney.

“I don’t see what has changed since last summer … when the president decided not to proceed with your nomination over concerns about your inexperience, partisanship and past statements that seemed to embellish your record,” the ranking Democrat on committee, Senator Mark Warner, said on Tuesday.

However the committee chair, Senator Richard Burr, and the other Republicans on the panel, indicated they would back Ratcliffe’s nomination and quickly put it to a vote in the full Senate, despite a legal requirement that the DNI “shall have extensive national security expertise”.

“The Democrats in the committee and the Senate seem strongly opposed, but Ratcliffe seems likely to secure confirmation, probably on a party-line vote,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor.

Tobias suggested that Ratcliffe’s promises to be objective may have assuaged doubters on the committee, or that Burr’s standing and independence may have been weakened after he was found to have sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks in mid-February, a few days after publishing a commentary for Fox News claiming that the US was “better prepared than ever before” to confront the virus.

Katrina Mulligan, a former official who worked for more than 10 years in the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI), suggested another factor that has changed since last summer could be that the Senate is eager to replace the current acting DNI, Richard Grenell, another partisan with even less experience than Ratcliffe and who is not answerable to Congress because he is not confirmed in the role.

Mulligan added that US intelligence officials may be resigned to Ratcliffe getting the top job for similar reasons.

“The morale at ODNI is so low right now and people are so fearful, that I think that there is a real sense that it could be worse,” she said. “There’s this sense that at least he can form coherent sentences, and at least he has a modicum of experience which the current acting DNI really did not.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/john-ratcliffe-us-senate-national-intelligence

Time is humanity’s ultimate organizing principle, and many, myself included, have longed for a neat finale during this pandemic – a day we can patiently wait for, when this will all be over.

At first, political authorities in many countries spoke of societal lockdown in terms of weeks – a challenge, yes, but a manageable one; there are even those who treated it as a rather novel adventure. More recently, as understanding of the pandemic develops, that metric is shifting, discouragingly, to months – even years.

Therapy under lockdown: 'I’m just as terrified as my patients are' Read more

Last week, Chris Whitty, the UK chief medical adviser, said that social distancing would have to continue at least all year, while Canadians have been told to expect limits on travel and gatherings for likely around a year and a half. Donald Trump recently admitted that America’s pandemic guidelines – which he initially claimed would be null by Easter – would likely remain into summer and, enigmatically, “beyond that”. Some regions are considering how to gradually reopen their economies, yet the experiences of Asian countries where infections surged as restrictions eased serve as cautionary tales. Dozens of experts have attested there will be no quick return to our previous lives.

Now that we are no longer at the beginning of this pandemic but in the seemingly interminable middle, the more relevant question to ask is not “when will this end?” but “how can we cope with this dragging on?”

One healthy thing you can do is to pre-emptively curb disappointment by readjusting your horizons, says Dr Amelia Aldao, a psychologist specializing in anxiety. Some of us may still have our hopes fixed to an event in the future – a July wedding we half-expect to attend, or a September getaway we think might just work out - and that can be problematic, says Aldao. “The way things are shaping up, there’s a lot of uncertainty – what’s going to be open? Is there going to be a second wave [of outbreaks]?” We just don’t know.

Looking forward to plans can be psychologically beneficial, keeping us engaged in life. But given the current circumstances, “Either focus on the right here, right now, the immediate days and weeks – we all have a lot of control over the next week,” says Aldao, “Or try focusing on the more distant future – maybe a year or more from now.”

Aldao’s advice dovetails with the wisdom of the US navy vice admiral James Stockdale. Stockdale, who spent seven years as a prisoner of the Vietnam war, is renowned for his articulation of what is now called “Stockdale’s paradox,” a “hope for the best, prepare for the worst” ethos captured by his quote: “You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end … with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.”

An advocate of steely pragmatism in the face of adversity, Stockdale observed that his cellmates – “the optimists” who believed they would be free by Christmas, then, when that didn’t happen, by Easter, and so on – became demoralized and “died of a broken heart”.

While our circumstances are distinctly unlike Stockdale’s, his wisdom regarding how to cope with uncertainty still resonates: we cannot afford to spend the entirety of this pandemic expecting normalcy to manifest just around the bend – doing so only compounds our pain.

So, aside from cancelling our plans and relinquishing faith in a clear-cut end date, how do we really confront the most brutal facts of our current reality, without getting bogged down by the sheer glumness of it all? It may sound counter-intuitive, but according to the psychologist and self-awareness researcher Dr Tasha Eurich, we can start by planning ahead for worst-case scenarios.

“We’re not going to be able to control the uncontrollable, but we can make a contingency plan,” says Eurich. “For example: if we’re all locked up in our houses until there’s a vaccine, the question should be, ‘Using everything I can control, how can I create a livable new reality, knowing that it won’t last forever, but knowing that my plan for a four-week isolation is going to be a lot different than for one that’s 12 months long?’”

We’re not going to be able to control the uncontrollable, but we can make a contingency plan Dr Tasha Eurich

You don’t want to get stuck ruminating on your fears, “but you have to figure out what could happen so you can control what you can, without it becoming a source of constant sadness,” she says. Make a plan for tangible circumstances, like what you will do if you or someone you live with gets sick, if your business cannot reopen, if a natural disaster occurs while you’re in lockdown – then put it aside and try not to worry about it.

You can also shift your focus inward. “Imagine you’re sitting with your grandkids in 50 years and they ask you, ‘What was it like during the pandemic?’” says Eurich. “Ask yourself, ‘What are the things in my life I want to use this as an opportunity to get clearer on, and how can I reframe my situation with that longer lens to figure out what I should be focused on right now?’”

If you find yourself worrying, Eurich suggests assessing your wellbeing in the moment – and appreciating what you do have. “To me, hope for the future can be replaced by hope for the present – gratitude,” she says.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/coronavirus-uncertainty-how-to-prepare

At least 256,239 people are known to have died since the outbreak began, while there have been at least 3,651,010 confirmed infections, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The figures are likely to vastly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic because they are reliant on official and media reports and do not include, for example, the many people presumed to have been infected but not tested.

['Ian Sample'],2020-05-05,Genetics in focus after coronavirus deaths of siblings and twins,"Amid the steady stream of stories on the lives lost to coronavirus are cases that stand out as remarkable. In the past month, at least two pairs of twins have died in Britain and two pairs of brothers, all within hours or days of each other. But do the deaths point to genetic factors that make some more likely than others to succumb to the disease?

Most scientists believe that genes play a role in how people respond to infections. A person’s genetic makeup may influence the receptors that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells. How resilient the person is to the infection, their general health, and how the immune system reacts will also have some genetic component.

A team led by Prof Tim Spector, head of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, has reported that Covid-19 symptoms appear to be 50% genetic. But Spector said more work is needed to understand which genes are involved and what difference they make to the course of the disease. “We don’t know if there are genes linked to the receptors or genes linked to how the infection presents,” he said.

Identical twins Katy and Emma Davis, aged 37, died at Southampton general hospital last month. The sisters, who lived together, had underlying health problems and had been ill for some time before they contracted the virus. Another pair of twins, Eleanor Andrews and her sister Eileen, aged 66, died earlier this month. They too lived together and had underlying health conditions.

Two brothers from Newport, Ghulam Abbas, 59, and Raza Abbas, 54, died within hours of each other at Royal Gwent hospital. Another pair of brothers from Luton, Olume Ivowi, 46, and Isi Ivowi, 38, died within days of each other.

“These deaths alert people to the fact that this could be genetic, but when people live together they share an environment as well,” Spector said. The upshot is that twins who live together are more likely to have similar lifestyles and behaviours, from diet and exercise habits to how quickly they seek medical care. Twins are not generally less healthy than the wider population.

Twin deaths made headlines long before the coronavirus struck. When Julian and Adrian Riester died on the same day in Florida in 2011, a cousin of the twin Franciscan monks said it was “confirmation that God favoured them”. But Spector sees the hand of cold statistics at work. “When you look formally at this, you see that twins rarely die at the same time,” he said. “There are billions of people on the planet. One in 70 is a twin and one in 200 is an identical twin.”

Marcus Munafo, professor of biological psychiatry at Bristol University, said reports of twin deaths must be interpreted with caution. Twin deaths are unusual, which makes them newsworthy, but coverage can distort our perceptions. “Salience bias refers to the fact that we tend to focus on information that stands out more, even if it’s not particularly relevant. So we need to be careful not to read too much into events that might stand out for reasons that are not actually related to the issue we’re interested in,” he said.

“When twins or siblings tragically die with Covid-19 that captures our attention, but that doesn’t mean there’s any particular reason to think twins or siblings are at greater risk.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/genetics-in-focus-after-coronavirus-deaths-of-siblings-and-twins
['Hannah Devlin'],2020-05-03,'Happy hypoxia': unusual coronavirus effect baffles doctors,"It is a mystery that has left doctors questioning the basic tenets of biology: Covid-19 patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death.

The phenomenon, known by some as “happy hypoxia” (some prefer the term “silent”) is raising questions about exactly how the virus attacks the lungs and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients.

A healthy person would be expected to have an oxygen saturation of at least 95%. But doctors are reporting patients attending A&E with oxygen percentage levels in the 80s or 70s, with some drastic cases below 50%.

“It’s intriguing to see so many people coming in, quite how hypoxic they are,” said Dr Jonathan Bannard-Smith, a consultant in critical care and anaesthesia at Manchester Royal Infirmary. “We’re seeing oxygen saturations that are very low and they’re unaware of that. We wouldn’t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It’s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.”

Dr Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that while other lung conditions could cause severe hypoxia, these patients would normally appear extremely ill. “With pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn’t be sat up in bed talking to you,” he said. “We just don’t understand it. We don’t know if it’s causing organ damage that we’re not able to detect. We don’t understand if the body’s compensating.”

Charlesworth had a personal experience of the issue while suffering from Covid-19 in March. After becoming unwell with a cough and fever, he spent 48 hours in bed, during which there were signs he was hypoxic, he said. “I was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious. Looking back I probably should’ve come into hospital. I’m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky. But I was probably hypoxic and my brain probably wasn’t working very well.”

He recovered after a few days in bed, but he and others are conscious that not all cases have positive outcomes.

An anaesthetist at a London hospital, who spoke anonymously, recalled one patient who attended A&E saying she felt cold. “When we put the stats probe on her, her saturation was 30% on air,” he said. “We obviously thought that was wrong, as usually patients are likely to have hypoxic cardiac arrests.” But when a blood sample was taken, her blood was very dark and had oxygen levels equivalent to those seen in people acclimatised to high altitudes. The patient was placed on a ventilator and survived for about a week before dying. “I have had a few patients like this,” the doctor said. “Sadly, their outcomes tend to be bad in my experience.”

Conventional medical wisdom is that as oxygen supplies fall, the heart, brain and other vital organs are placed at risk – and the effect is thought to be cumulative. Typically patients would lose consciousness below an oxygen saturation of 75%.

However, it is not the fall in oxygen levels itself that leaves people feeling breathless. Instead, the body senses the rising levels of carbon dioxide that typically occur simultaneously as the lungs are unable to clear gas as efficiently. But in some Covid-19 patients, this response does not appear to be kicking in.

“I don’t think any of us expect that what we’re seeing can be explained by one process,” said Bannard-Smith.

Swelling and inflammation in the lungs is likely to make it difficult for oxygen to enter the bloodstream. There is also emerging evidence that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting. The vessels in the lungs that collect oxygen and transfer it into the wider bloodstream are so tiny they can become blocked with the smallest of clots.

Several clinical trials are looking at whether blood thinners could prevent or treat complications of Covid-19, including respiratory problems and low blood oxygen.

Some have suggested that, since people are often oblivious to falling oxygen levels, those with Covid-19 symptoms or a positive test result should be given pulse oximeters, a simple device that clips on to the finger and can be used to detect oxygen levels at home. However, as yet there is no evidence that early detection of hypoxia would help avoid severe outcomes and Charlesworth said the practicalities would be difficult.

“Transportation of the devices would put more people on the road,” he said. “Then there are issues around people buying them on the internet and whether they [have proper safety certificates] … If you’re at the point of needing your oxygen levels monitored that’s the time to go to hospital.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/happy-hypoxia-unusual-coronavirus-effect-baffles-doctors

An air force vet turned nurse, a 'fireball' prankster: the US health workers who died from Covid-19

America’s healthcare workers are dying. In some states, medical staff account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. From doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics, those most at risk have already helped save thousands of lives.

Not all these medical professionals survive their encounters with patients. Hospitals are overwhelmed, workers lack protective equipment and some staff suffer from underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to this pernicious virus.

Health authorities in the US have no consistent way of tallying the deaths of healthcare workers. As of 14 April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 deaths among health workers – but our reporting shows that is likely a vast undercount.

Lost on the frontline is a collaboration between the Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to document the lives of healthcare workers in the US who die from Covid-19, and to understand why so many are falling victim to the pandemic.

These are some of the first tragic cases. We are creating a database and will investigate and record new cases as this project unfolds.

Lisa Ewald, 53

An animal lover who loved comic book conventions, she died alone at home

Occupation: Registered nurse

Place of work: Henry Ford hospital in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 1 April 2020

Lisa Ewald was a nurse to many living things, human and otherwise.

When her neighbor Alexis Fernandez’s border collie had a stomach blockage, Ewald hooked the dog up to an IV four times a day. “She was this dedicated nurse who nursed my dog back to health,” said Fernandez.

Ewald also loved gardening, aerospace and comic book conventions.

Ewald told Fernandez that a patient she had treated later tested positive for Covid-19, and that she was not wearing a mask at the time. Two days after seeing the patient, she got sick. After delays in accessing a test, she learned on 30 March that she was infected with the coronavirus.

A hospital spokesperson acknowledged that staff who treat coronavirus patients have a higher risk of exposure, but said there was “no way to confirm” how a staff person contracted the virus.

On 31 March, Ewald didn’t answer when Fernandez texted her. The next day, Fernandez and a hospital nurse went to her home to check on her and found her unresponsive on the couch.

“I said: ‘Aren’t you going to go take her pulse or anything?’” Fernandez said. “The nurse just said: ‘She’s gone.’”

An ardent EMT who seemed to have nine lives

Occupation: Emergency medical technician

Place of work: Atlantic health system in Mountainside and Warren, New Jersey

Date of death: 13 April 2020

Scott Geiger wasn’t always enthusiastic about school, but at 16 he brought home a tome the size of two phone books. It was a manual for emergency medical technicians, and he devoured it, said his younger brother, Ben.

Scott was certified as an EMT at 17. He never married or had kids, but did not seem to miss those things.

“He was so focused on being an EMT and helping people in their most vulnerable and desperate moments,” Ben said. “That’s really what made him feel good.”

Geiger loved playing pool each week with friends. He was a loyal New York Jets football fan, content to joke about their follies and watch them lose. He was quiet. And he seemed to have nine lives, his brother said, surviving hospitalizations for epilepsy as a child and blood cancer as an adult.

When the coronavirus began to tear a path through northern New Jersey, he faced his work with resolve. He downplayed his symptoms when he first fell ill, in late March, but wound up spending 17 days on a ventilator before he died. The family has had to mourn separately, with the brothers’ father, who lived with Scott, in quarantine, and their mother confined to her room in a nursing home that has Covid-19 cases.

Date of death: 27 March 2020

Theresa Lococo spent most of her life at the hospital, working as a pediatric nurse for almost 48 years.

“There wasn’t a day that goes by she wouldn’t come home and tell me about her patients,” said her daughter, Lisa Lococo. “She had to be forced to take her vacation days.”

New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, publicly saluted her lifelong service to New Yorkers, saying: “She gave her life helping others.”

Theresa had dogs – “sometimes too many”, Lisa said – and lived with her son, Anthony, in the home she owned for decades. She loved cooking and watching cooking shows, reading and following soap operas.

Theresa wasn’t tested for Covid-19. But Kings county hospital, in Brooklyn, was hit hard by the coronavirus.

Days before dying, she described nausea. Friends recalled a cough. Her supervisor encouraged her to stay home, her daughter said.

Lisa called her mother on 27 March, just as Anthony was dialing 911 for help.

“She always put others first,” Lisa said. “She always put herself last.”

Date of death: 9 April 2020

Tom Luna was a joker, a lively and outgoing man who thrived on the fast-paced and varied action of the emergency room. He also adored his three daughters, something clear to all who knew him.

“Tom was a fantastic emergency nurse. He was well-liked and loved by his peers,” a spokesperson for the Trinitas emergency department said in a statement. “His greatest love was for his wife and daughters, who he was very proud of.”

His oldest daughter, Gabrielle, 25, followed his path to become an ER nurse. When Tom fell ill with the coronavirus, he was admitted at the hospital where she works. At the end of her 12-hour night shifts, she made sure he had breakfast and helped him change his clothes. She propped a family photo next to his bed.

Tom’s wife, Kit, also a nurse, said that when some of his symptoms appeared to let up, they talked about him recovering at home. He was a planner, she said, and was already talking about their next family vacation, maybe to Spain.

After Michael Marceaux retired from the air force, he went back to school. In 2018 he launched a new career as an emergency room nurse.

“Everyone who worked with him said he was so happy,” said Drake Marceaux, one of his four sons. “He was willing to go above and beyond for patients.”

As coronavirus spread throughout Louisiana, Michael developed a cough and fever. Soon after he tested positive for Covid-19.

“He didn’t seem too worried,” Drake said. “He just wanted to make sure not to give it to other people.”

A spokesperson for Christus Health said Marceaux would be missed for his “positive attitude, even after a hard shift. His laughter brought joy to others.” The spokesperson declined to answer questions about workplace safety conditions.

Drake said he wanted his father to be remembered for how much he was loved.

His funeral was live-streamed on Facebook. “At one point, there were 2,000 viewers watching his service,” Drake said. “As much as he didn’t want attention, it gravitated toward him.”

In late March, Dr Francis “Frankie” Molinari told his sister Lisa he was “down for the count”, with chills, fever and trouble breathing.

“Frankie, you know what you have,” she recalled telling him.

Two days later, he collapsed at home and was rushed to Clara Maass medical center. Colleagues stayed by his side as he succumbed to Covid-19.

“We take solace in the fact that he was cared for by colleagues and friends who deeply loved and respected him,” his sister Janice wrote in a blog. “He died a hero among heroes.”

Frankie, a New Jersey native who was married with an adult daughter, was the oldest of four siblings. His sisters described him as an optimist who loved music, fishing and telling tall tales: he went to medical school in Bologna, Italy, and he liked to say he had played pinochle with the pope.

“A friend had once described us as four different legs of the same table,” Janice wrote. “Now I’m stuck on the fact that we are only a three-legged table. Less beautiful, less sturdy. Broken.”

He practiced medicine for over four decades, caring for generations of patients in the same family. His family suspects he contracted the coronavirus at his private practice.

Whenever she traveled to her hometown of Tagudin in the Philippines, Celia Lardizabal Marcos showered family with gifts and delighted in planning weekend outings for everyone, said her eldest son, Donald.

And when she returned home to California, she brought presents for her sons. “She always thought of how her family could be happy,” he said.

Trained as a nurse in her home country, Marcos emigrated to the United States in 2001 and settled in Los Angeles. Three years later, she became a telemetry charge nurse, a specialist who tracks patients’ vital signs using hi-tech equipment.

On 3 April, she was one of three nurses who responded after a suspected coronavirus patient went into cardiac arrest. Wearing a surgical mask, she intubated the patient. Three days later, she had a headache, body aches and difficulty breathing.

Her symptoms worsened, and she was admitted on 15 April to the hospital where she had worked for 16 years. Two days later, she went into cardiac arrest and died.

Her sons say they plan to honor her wishes to be cremated and buried in Tagudin, alongside her parents.

Celia Yap-Banago was a 5-ft-tall “fireball”, said one co-worker. She had moved to the US from the Philippines in 1970 and worked for nearly 40 years for the HCA Midwest Health system. Her family said she was planning for retirement.

Her son Josh said she showed her love through practical jokes. “You knew she loved you if she was yelling at you or if she was pranking you,” he said.

“She was very outspoken,” said Charlene Carter, a fellow nurse. “But I later learned that’s a really good quality to have, as a nurse, so you can advocate for your patients and advocate for yourself.”

In March, Yap-Banago treated a patient who later tested positive for Covid-19. Carter said Yap-Banago was not given personal protective equipment because she was not working in an area designed for coronavirus patients. She spent her final days in isolation to protect others.

A spokesperson for HCA Midwest Health said that medical staff received adequate personal protective equipment in line with CDC guidelines.

Josh said she spoke with reverence of her patients and their families. “She was always focused on the family as a whole, and that the family was taken care of, not just the patient in the bed,” he said.

Date of death: 31 March 2020

When Israel Tolentino Jr arrived for his EMT shift one morning in March, he seemed fine. Then he got a headache, and then a fever. He was sent home, said Vito Cicchetti, a director at Saint Clare’s Health.

Izzy, as he was called, was an EMT who fulfilled his dream to become a firefighter. In 2018, the former marine took a job with the Passaic fire department but continued to take shifts at Saint Clare’s.

He was husband to Maria Vazquez, whom he’d met at church, according to nj.com. They had two young children.

Tolentino and his partner worked brutal, 12-hour shifts during the pandemic. They were dispatched to one emergency after another, each typically lasting under an hour but requiring nearly as long to decontaminate their gear and truck.

Izzy died in hospital care. The coronavirus tore through his EMT team. Most eventually recovered. But his friend and co-worker Kevin Leiva also died.

Cicchetti said he missed Izzy’s unflappable, cheerful presence. “No matter how mad you were, he’d come up with a smile and you’d be chuckling to yourself,” he said.

Cicchetti hasn’t replaced either man. “I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet,” he said.

Rose Taldon was just 5ft tall. But when she bellowed their names out the window, her kids ran right home.

“She didn’t take any crap,” said her daughter, Teadris Pope.

Taldon and her husband raised three children on the same street where she grew up, in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood. Strong-willed and commanding respect, she earned a nursing degree while working in public transit for 23 years. Though she could be stern, she was quick to play-fight and tickle her eight grandkids, Pope said.

Taldon was generous: even as she lay in a hospital in April, exhausted from the coronavirus, she arranged to pay bills for an out-of-work friend, her daughter said.

It’s unclear whether Taldon caught the virus at her hospital, which was designated for non-Covid patients. Hospital officials said three patients and 22 staff had tested positive.

At 2am on Easter morning, a doctor offered to go into Taldon’s hospital room and connect Pope to her mother on a video call, since she couldn’t visit in person.

“I just talked until I had no words,” Pope said. “I was just telling her, ‘We’re so proud of you. You worked so hard raising us … You’ve gone through a hell of a fight.’”

An hour later, her mother was gone.

Date of death: 7 April 2020

When Kevin Leiva died of Covid-19 in early April, it was a second crushing loss to his close-knit team of EMT workers. Their colleague, Israel Tolentino Jr, had died one week before.

“People were scared that everyone was going to die from it,” said Vito Cicchetti, a director at Saint Clare’s Health, where the men worked. “After Izzy died, we all started getting scared for Kevin.”

Leiva, according to an obituary, “was always worried about his crew”. He was proud of his work and said: “Becoming an EMT was an act of God.”

He met his wife, Marina, online while they were in high school. He loved spending time at their home, playing guitar and tending to his tegu lizards, AJ and Blue.

As Covid-19 spread, the station’s three ambulances each handled up to 15 dispatches a shift, roughly twice as many as usual. EMTs often responded to calls continuously, stopping only to clean their personal protective equipment and disinfect the ambulance.

Leiva “always had a joke” that helped to defuse stressful situations and bring his co-workers together, Cicchetti said.

Bill Birmingham Jr remembers the year his father took on a new career. The whole family studied, even acting out scenes to ensure Billy Birmingham Sr, a minister, was ready for his emergency medical technician exam.

“He put his all into it,” the son recalled.

Billy Birmingham passed the test. And from the late 1990s on, he served as an EMT and a minister.

His family rallied again when he pursued a doctorate in pastoral theology, which he earned in 2005. During nearly four decades as a minister, he opened two churches.

“He had a heart for other people,” his son said. “Whatever he could do for other people, he would do it.”

As a fire department EMT, he was exposed to the coronavirus. The cough came in March.

“‘I’m just tired.’ That’s what he kept saying,” his son said. His dad went to the hospital twice. The first time he told the staff about his symptoms and underlying health conditions, then they sent him home.

The second time he arrived in an ambulance. Just over two weeks later, as he lay dying, hospital staff set up a video chat so his family could see him one last time.

John Schoffstall grew up around firehouses, and it was at his own firehouse in Terre Haute, Indiana, that he was exposed to the coronavirus.

A paramedic and firefighter with the Terre Haute fire department for almost 12 years, Schoffstall died on 12 April at age 41. Glen Hall, the deputy chief, said the department has been responding every day to calls from patients showing symptoms of Covid-19, although investigations by the county health department and his own department determined Schoffstall contracted the virus from another firefighter. Four other firefighters became mildly ill.

Jennifer Schoffstall, his wife of 18 years, said her husband went to the hospital on 28 March.

“His breathing was so bad in the ER, they just decided to keep him,” she said. “He regressed from there.”

Place of work: University of Miami and Jackson health systems, Miami, Florida

Date of death: 8 April 2020

“Somos felices.” That was Dr Luis Caldera-Nieves’ signature sign-off after a cesarean section or at the end of a difficult shift. “We’re happy,” he meant, and often, when he was around, it was true.

Caldera-Nieves, a popular OB-GYN, trained scores of doctors and helped bring thousands of babies into the world in his 25 years at the University of Miami and Jackson health systems.

Born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, he worked at an air force base before joining UM, said Dr Jaime Santiago, a longtime co-worker. Caldera-Nieves was so devoted to his patients that he often gave them his private phone number – and his wife’s, Santiago said.

Because he was so jovial, he earned the nickname “the Puerto Rican Santa Claus”, Santiago said.

“He was truly loved and admired by everyone who worked with him, and will be remembered for his humor and never-ending positive energy,” said Dr Jean-Marie Stephan, who trained under Caldera-Nieves.

In a statement, UM and Jackson confirmed Caldera-Nieves died from complications of Covid-19 and said they “grieve the loss of our esteemed and beloved colleague.” He is survived by his wife and six adult children.

Capt Franklin Williams, 57

‘It’s a nightmare’

Occupation: Firefighter and medical first responder

Place of work: Detroit fire department in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 8 April 2020

Capt Franklin Williams stood at the altar on his wedding day and pretended to hunt for the ring. He patted his chest, then his pockets and looked up at his soon-to-be wife with a “million-dollar smile”.

He was always clowning and “so silly”, said Shanita Williams, his wife, recalling how he always tried to make her laugh. Williams died from complications of the novel coronavirus on 8 April – one month before the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary.

Williams had been on an emergency call with a verified Covid-19 patient before falling ill, according to the Detroit fire department chief, Robert Distelrath. Crews are equipped with personal protective equipment including a gown, N95 mask and gloves, he said.

But it’s easy for a mask to slip – “when you’re giving [chest] compressions, your mask isn’t staying in place all the time,” said Thomas Gehart, president of the Detroit Fire Fighters Association.

When Williams fell sick on 24 March, he moved to his home’s guest bedroom to avoid infecting his wife. He never returned to work.

“I’m thankful and thank God for having him in my life,” Shanita said, adding that she keeps thinking, “it’s a nightmare and I’m going to wake up. But it’s not.”

Aleyamma John, 65

‘We’re failing miserably without her’

Occupation: Registered nurse

Place of work: Queens hospital center in Queens, New York

Date of death: 5 April 2020

Aleyamma John’s family wanted her to retire. Her husband, John, an MTA transit worker, had stopped working a few years earlier. He and their son Ginu urged her to follow suit. “We told her, ‘I’m sure dad wants to see the world with you – you need to give him that opportunity,’” Ginu said.

She demurred. “I think she found fulfillment in being able to serve,” Ginu said. “She was able to hold people’s hands, you know, even when they were deteriorating and be there for them.” She began her career as a nurse in India 45 years ago; she and her husband emigrated to the United Arab Emirates, where their two sons were born, and moved to New York in 2002.

Ginu said his mother, a devout Christian, found joy in tending to her vegetable garden and doting on her two grandchildren. She cooked dishes from her native India and filled the Long Island home she shared with John, Ginu and Ginu’s family with flowers.

In March, as Queens hospital center began to swell with Covid-19 patients, Aleyamma sent her family of a photo of herself and colleagues wearing surgical hats and masks, but not enough personal protective equipment. Days later she developed a fever and tested positive for the virus. Johnny, Ginu and Ginu’s wife, Elsa, a nurse practitioner, also became ill.

When Aleyamma’s breathing became labored, her family made the difficult decision to call 911. It would be the last time they saw her. “We’re 17 days in, and I feel like we’re failing miserably without her,” Ginu said.

Mike Field, 59

A 9/11 first responder, he answered the call during the pandemic

Occupation: Volunteer emergency medical technician

Place of work: Village of Valley Stream, New York

Date of death: 8 April 2020

Mike Field had a strong sense of civic duty. An emergency medical technician, he was a first responder with the New York fire department (FDNY) on 9/11. He was also a member of his community’s all-volunteer fire department since 1987.

After he retired from FDNY in 2002, he took a job making and posting street signs with his local public works department. He continued to volunteer with Valley Stream’s fire department and mentored the junior fire department. When he wasn’t responding to emergencies or training future emergency technicians he led a Boy Scout troop and volunteered for animal causes.

“Here’s somebody who cares about the community and cares about its people,” said Valley Stream’s mayor, Ed Fare, who had known Mike since the seventh grade.

Stacey Field, his wife, said he found his calling early, after his own father experienced a heart attack. “When the fire department EMTs came and helped his dad, he decided that’s what he wanted to do,” she said.

Their three sons – Steven, 26; Richie, 22; and Jason, 19 – have followed in their father’s footsteps. Steven and Richie are EMTs in New York; Jason plans on training to become one as well. All three volunteer at the same fire station their father did.

In late March, Mike and fellow volunteer responders were called to an emergency involving a patient showing symptoms of Covid-19. Field died on 8 April.

She was just starting on a path to becoming a nurse

Occupation: Nursing assistant

Place of Work: Extended Care hospital of Riverside, California

Date of Death: 5 April 2020

Valeria Viveros was “barely blooming”, developing the skills and ambition to pursue a nursing career, said Gustavo Urrea, her uncle. Working at Extended Care hospital of Riverside was her first job.

Viveros, born in California to Mexican immigrants, grew attached to her patients at the nursing home, bringing them homemade ceviche, Urrea said. About a month ago, as he watched her cook, play and joke with her grandmother, he noticed how much her social skills had grown.

When she would say “Hi, tío,” in her playful, sweet, high-pitched voice, “it was like the best therapy you could have,” Urrea recalled. Viveros, who lived with her parents and two siblings, was enrolled in classes at a community college.

Viveros began to feel sick on 30 March, went to a nearby hospital and was sent home with Tylenol, Urrea said. By 4 April, she was too weak to get out of bed on her own. She left in an ambulance and never came back.

“We’re all destroyed,” he said. “I can’t even believe it.”

On 5 April, county health officials reported a coronavirus outbreak had sickened 30 patients and some staff at the nursing home where she worked. Trent Evans, general counsel for Extended Care, said staffers were heartbroken by her death.

Viveros was “head over heels in love with the residents that she served”, he said. “She was always there for them.”

She remembered the small – but meaningful – details about those in her care

Occupation: Nursing assistant and medication aide

Place of Work: Signature HealthCARE at Summit Manor, Columbia, Kentucky

Date of Death: 13 April 2020

Pamela Hughes lived her entire life in rural Columbia, Kentucky, but longed for wide, sandy beaches. For vacation, Hughes and her daughter, Brie, 26, eagerly drove 14 hours to Daytona Beach, Florida, or Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Hughes worked at Summit Manor, a nursing home in Columbia, for 32 years. She knew which residents preferred chocolate milk or applesauce with their medication; she remembered their favorite outfits and colors. Hughes’s usually shy demeanor vanished each December when she and co-worker Angie McAllister built a float for the town’s Christmas parade competition.

“We built 10 floats over 10 years,” McAllister said. “We got second place every year.”

Even after several residents tested positive for the coronavirus, Hughes dismissed her worsening cough as allergies or bronchitis. The nursing home was short on help and she wanted to serve her patients, Brie said.

Days later, the public health department suggested her mother get tested. She tested positive, and her health worsened – food tasted bitter, her fever soared, her hearing dulled. On 10 April, Hughes was taken by ambulance to a hospital, then by helicopter to Jewish hospital in Louisville. Barred from visiting, Brie said goodbye over FaceTime.

James House, 40

An eager student, he wanted to become a physician assistant

Occupation: Registered nurse

Place of work: Omni Continuing Care in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 31 March 2020

James House had a voracious appetite for learning about and a fascination with the human body.

His sister, Catrisha House-Phelps, traces it back to childhood visits to a dialysis center where their father received treatments. “That was what tugged at his heart,” she said. “He just always wanted to know ‘why’.”

House-Phelps said her brother adored his five children, treasured his anatomy and physiology books, and got a kick out of the residents he cared for at Omni Continuing Care. “He thought they were family; he just said they were funny people,” she said. He had hoped to go back to school to become a physician assistant.

House came down with what he thought was the flu in mid-March. His sister said he tried to get tested for Covid-19 but was turned away because he was not showing textbook symptoms and had no underlying health issues. On 31 March, after resting at home for over a week, House returned to work. Hours later, he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.

He texted his sister with updates on his condition. “I’m about to be intubated now,” he wrote. It was the last message he sent her.

Occupation: Radiology clerk

Place of work: Woodhull medical center in Brooklyn, New York

Date of death: 7 April 2020

After more than 30 years at one of New York City’s busy public hospitals, Thomas Soto loved his job but was looking forward to retiring, said his son, Jesse Soto, who lived with him. Thomas looked forward to visits with his four-year-old grandson.

“They did everything together,” said Jesse. He often shared meals with the little boy and took him to a local toy store.

At Thomas’s busy station near the emergency room, he greeted patients and took down their information.

“Everybody saw him before their X-rays,” Jesse, 29, said. “He smiled all day, made jokes. He was a kind man.”

As Covid-19 patients began to overwhelm Woodhull and other emergency rooms across the city, Jesse said that at first, his father didn’t have any protective gear. (The hospital did not respond to requests for comment.)

He eventually got a mask. But he soon grew sick, developing a high fever, body aches and a cough. After a week, Soto said, “he couldn’t take it any more”.

He was admitted at Woodhull and died two days later.

Occupation: Registered nurse

Place of work: Long Island community hospital in East Patchogue, New York

Date of death: 7 April 2020

In 2004, Ali Dennis Guillermo, his wife, Romielyn, and their daughter uprooted their lives in the Philippines and moved to New York.

Everything fell into place. The former nursing instructor landed a job at Long Island community hospital, often working in intensive care or the emergency room. He enjoyed the intensity of ER work, his wife said.

As years passed, the couple had two sons and settled into a close-knit Filipino community on Long Island.

He was devoted to his three children.

“He was such a lovely and good father,” Romielyn said.

As Covid-19 emerged, he was assigned to patients who were transitioning out of intensive care. Many of the nurses on his floor had gotten sick, and “everybody was scared,” Romielyn said.

In late March, he began to feel achy, with a fever that soared to 102F (38.9C). Within days, his blood oxygen level plummeted.

His nails turned blue, an effect of low blood oxygen levels, and he asked his wife to take him to the ER. That was the last time they spoke. Guillermo was intubated in the ICU unit where he had worked. Nearly two weeks later, he died.

A whip-smart neurologist, Sclar was endlessly fascinated with the brain

Occupation: Neurologist

Place of work: Mount Sinai Queens in Queens, New York

Date of death: 12 April 2020

Gary Sclar was a whip-smart neurologist who loved comic books, Game of Thrones and Star Wars, said his daughter, Jennifer Sclar. He was deeply compassionate with a blunt bedside manner.

“My dad was fascinated with the brain and with science,” Jennifer Sclar said. “His work was his passion, and it’s what made him the happiest, besides my brother and me.” Set to retire in June, he was looking forward to writing about politics and neurology.

Gary Sclar saw patients who were showing Covid-19 symptoms and knew his age and underlying health conditions – he had diabetes – put him at risk for developing complications from the illness. His daughter pleaded with him to stop going in to the hospital.

In early April, he mentioned having lost his sense of smell, and on 8 April, he collapsed in his home. He was hospitalized a few days later and agreed to be intubated. “I don’t think he realized like that this was the end,” Sclar said. “He brought his keys. He brought his wallet.”

Selfless and sassy, Alabama nurse cared for a Covid-19 patient at a nursing home

Occupation: Nurse

Place of work: Marion Regional nursing home in Hamilton, Alabama

Date of death: 6 April 2020

Rose Harrison lived to serve others – her husband, three daughters, grandchildren and the residents of the nursing home where she worked. Though the Alabama nurse was selfless, she also had a sassy edge to her personality and was given to fits of pique behind the wheel, her daughter, Amanda Williams said.

“Her personality was so funny, you automatically loved her,” Williams said. “She was so outspoken. If she didn’t agree with you, she’d tell you in a respectful way.”

Williams was not wearing a mask when she cared for a patient who later tested positive for Covid-19 at Marion Regional nursing home in Hamilton, Alabama, her daughter said. She later developed a cough, fatigue and a low-grade fever, but kept reporting to duty all week. Officials from the nursing home did not return calls for comment.

On 3 April, Williams drove her mother to a hospital. The following evening, Harrison discussed the option of going on a ventilator with loved ones on a video call, agreeing it was the best course. Williams believed that her mother fully expected to recover.

Occupation: Surgical technician

Place of work: Detroit medical center Harper University hospital in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 11 April 2020

Monica Echeverri Casarez was in constant motion, said her husband, Jorge Casarez. The daughter of Colombian immigrants, she worked as a Spanish-English interpreter in clinical settings. She was the kind of person whose arrival at a mom-and-pop restaurant would elicit hugs from the owners. She also co-founded Southwest Detroit Restaurant Week, a not-for-profit that supports local businesses.

Twice a month, she scrubbed in as a surgical technician at Harper University hospital. “She liked discovering the beauty of how the body works and how science is clear and orderly,” Casarez said. She was organized and intuitive, qualities that are assets in the operating room.

On 21 March, she posted a photo of herself in protective gear with the caption: “I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t at least a bit nervous to be there now.” Since many elective surgeries had been canceled, Echeverri Casarez was tasked with taking the temperatures of people who walked into the hospital and making sure their hands were sterilized.

Soon after, Echeverri Casarez and Casarez began feeling ill. Quarantined together, Echeverri Casarez tried to make the best of the situation. She baked her husband a cake – chocolate with white frosting. She died a few days later.

Occupation: Electrocardiogram technician

Place of work: University hospital in Newark, New Jersey

Date of death: 31 March 2020

Kim King-Smith was a natural caregiver. An only child, she grew up close to her extended family, including her cousins Hassana Salaam-Rivers and Sharonda Salaam. After Salaam developed multiple sclerosis, King-Smith visited her every day.

“She’d bring her sweets that she wasn’t supposed to have and share them with her,” Salaam-Rivers said. King-Smith’s desire to care for others was the reason she became an electrocardiogram technician, her cousin added. “If a friend of a friend or family member went to the hospital, she would always go and visit them as soon as her shift was over,” she said.

In March, King-Smith cared for a patient she said had symptoms of Covid-19; she soon fell ill herself and tested positive for the virus. It seemed like a mild case at first, and she stayed in touch with family via FaceTime while trying to isolate from her husband, Lenny.

On 29 March, Salaam-Rivers checked in on her cousin and noticed she was struggling to breathe. She urged her to call an ambulance. After King-Smith was hospitalized, she exchanged text messages with her mother and cousin. As the day progressed, her messages carried increasingly grave news, Salaam-Rivers said. Then she stopped responding.

A social worker with panache who helped people struggling with addiction

Occupation: Social worker

Place of work: Cornell Scott-Hill health center and New Reach in New Haven, Connecticut

Date of death: 23 March 2020

At a shelter for adults recovering from addiction, residents looked forward to the days when Marion “Curtis” Hunt would take the stage, emceeing talent shows and belting out Broadway and gospel tunes.

It wasn’t part of his job description as a social worker. It was just one of the ways he went “above and beyond”, said Daena Murphy, his supervisor at Cornell Scott-Hill health center. “He had a beautiful voice,” she said. “He was just a wonderful person – funny, engaging, always a huge smile on his face.”

Hunt, the youngest of four brothers, earned his master’s in social work from Fordham University at 52, and was baptized at his brother’s Pentecostal church at 54. He was a devoted uncle who doted on his dog and cat, Mya and Milo.

It’s unclear how Hunt got infected, but one patient he worked with tested positive for Covid-19, as did two co-workers, according to Dr Ece Tek, another supervisor at Cornell Scott-Hill health center. Hunt died on 23 March, one week after developing flu-like symptoms, said his brother John Mann Jr.

Occupation: Intensive care unit nurse

Place of work: Jackson Memorial hospital in Miami, Florida

Date of death: 27 March 2020

For Jhoanna Mariel Buendia, her aunt was a constant – if distant – presence. Araceli Buendia Ilagan emigrated from their hometown Baguio, in the Philippines, to the US before Buendia was born, but she remained close to her family and communicated with them nearly every day.

“She was one of the smartest people I ever knew,” Buendia, 27, said. Buendia Ilagan, who at one point looked into adopting her niece so she could join her and her husband the United States, encouraged Buendia to become a nurse, and talked her through grueling coursework in anatomy and physiology. Buendia is now a nurse in London.

Buendia Ilagan was also demanding. “Whenever she visited the Philippines, she wanted everything to be organized and squeaky clean,” Buendia said.

The last time the two spoke, in late March, Buendia Ilagan didn’t mention anything about feeling ill. Instead, the two commiserated over their experiences of treating patients with Covid-19; as always, her aunt offered her advice on staying safe while giving the best possible care. She died four days later.

A beloved geriatric psychiatrist and church musician remembered for his cooking skills

Occupation: Geriatric psychiatrist

Place of work: Christ hospital and CarePoint health in Jersey City, New Jersey

Date of death: 8 April 2020

Dr Leo Dela Cruz was nervous about going to work in the weeks before he died, his friends said. Like many in the region, Christ hospital had an influx of Covid-19 patients and faced a shortage of ventilators and masks.

Dela Cruz was a geriatric psychiatrist and didn’t work in coronavirus wards. But he continued to see patients in person. In early April, Dela Cruz, who lived alone, complained only of migraines, his friends said. Within a week his condition worsened, and he was put on a ventilator at a nearby hospital. He died soon after.

Friends said he may have been exposed at the hospital. (In a statement, hospital representatives said he didn’t treat Covid-19 patients.)

Dela Cruz, the oldest of 10 siblings, came from a family of healthcare professionals. His friends and family – from Cebu, Philippines, to Teaneck, New Jersey – remembered his jovial personality on Facebook. He won “best doctor of the year” awards, played tennis, and cooked traditional Cebu dishes.

Nida Gonzales, a colleague, said he always supported people, whether funding a student’s education or running a church mental health program. “I feel like I lost a brother,” she said.

Verrier was so committed to fighting the virus, he called into work meetings even after he got sick

Occupation: Surgeon

Place of work: St Barnabas hospital in the Bronx, New York

Date of death: 8 April 2020

Dr J Ronald Verrier spent the final weeks of his life tending to a torrent of patients infected with Covid-19. Workers at St Barnabas hospital struggled to find masks and gowns as staff set up makeshift morgues in the parking lot. (Many nurses continue to make cloth masks.)

Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Verrier emigrated to the United States and had worked at St Barnabas for the last two decades, overseeing the general surgery residency program.

A towering presence with a wide, dimpled smile, Verrier was a natural mentor who was known to drop into patients’ rooms for impromptu birthday parties.

“He kept pushing me forward,” said Dr Christina Pardo, Verrier’s cousin and an obstetrician and gynecologist in New York. “I would call him and say, ‘I swear I failed that test,’ and he would laugh. He was my confidence when I didn’t have it.”

The Verrier family stretches across continents and Verrier kept them close, zipping around to a niece’s wedding in Belgium, a baptism in Florida and another wedding in Montreal in recent years. He had recently ferried medical supplies to Haiti, a decade after he had traveled to his homeland to tend to victims of the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake.

Verrier helped steer St Barnabas’s efforts to increase its capacity as Covid-19 cases increased. “He was at the hospital every day,” Dr Ridwan Shabsigh, the surgery department’s chair, said. “This was a nonstop effort.”

In early April, Verrier discovered he was infected. After developing symptoms, he continued to call into meetings from his home in Woodmere, New York. Shabsigh spoke with Verrier on 7 April, and said his spirits were high. The next day, he was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died.

Vianna Thompson, 52

Thompson texted from the bedroom: ‘Call the ambulance, I can hardly breathe’

Occupation: Nurse

Place of work: VA Sierra Nevada health care system and Northern Nevada medical center in Reno, Nevada

Date of death: 7 April 2020

In late March, Vianna Thompson spent two night shifts caring for a co-worker who was suffering from Covid-19. Two weeks later, she was lying in an intensive care unit, with a colleague holding her hand.

Thompson and Bruce McAllister, the man she treated, were among three VA healthcare workers in Reno, Nevada, who died within a two-week span from the novel coronavirus.

“It’s pretty devastating. It’s surreal. Reno’s not that big of a city,” said Robyn Underhill, a night nurse who worked with Thompson.

Thompson was born Vianna Fye in Port Huron, Michigan. She met her husband, Bob, in 1991 on the Osan airbase in South Korea, where she was a veterinary technician and cared for military police dogs. They bonded over two-step dancing and country music.

Vianna was a proud mother who worked long hours to provide for her three sons, buying them saxophones, drums and keyboards so they could play jazz and country music.

“She was just sweet, big-hearted, caring, unselfish,” Bob Thompson said. Vianna came to work with a cough on 29 March, a day after McAllister died. ”We were all very concerned,” Underhill said. “Call it intuition, call it ‘Spidey sense’, but I knew that moment that she was coughing that this was not going to end well.”

That shift was Thompson’s last. Over the next four days, she wrestled with fever, weakness and shortness of breath. The following Thursday, she texted her husband from the bedroom: “Call the ambulance, I can hardly breathe.”

She was taken to the VA hospital and put on a ventilator. On 17 March, as her organs began to fail, Thompson’s colleagues connected to Bob on FaceTime so he could say goodbye.

As a veteran, she qualified for an “honor flight”, in which the patient’s body is covered with a black box and wheeled through the hospital while others line up and salute. Because of the infectious nature of the coronavirus, a US flag could not be safely draped over her body, so a family friend walked in front of her and carried it.

Thompson said the ceremony drew more people lining the hallways than staff had seen in 20 years. “God’s getting a hell of a nurse,” he said.

After some struggles, Simmons turned his life around

Occupation: Environmental service assistant

Place of work: Rochester general hospital in Rochester, New York

Date of death: 17 March 2020

Alvin Simmons started working as a custodian at Rochester general hospital, in New York state, only weeks before he fell ill. “He loved helping people and he figured the best place to do that would be in a hospital,” his sister Michelle Wilcox said.

An army veteran who had served in the first Gulf war, Simmons loved karaoke and doted on his three grandchildren, Wilcox said. “He was a dedicated, hard-working individual who had just changed his life around” since a prison stint, she said.

According to Wilcox, Simmons began developing symptoms shortly after cleaning the room of a woman he believed was infected with the novel coronavirus. (In an email, a hospital spokesperson said it had “no evidence to suggest that Mr Simmons was at a heightened risk of exposure to Covid-19 by virtue of his training or employment duties” and that he was the hospital’s first diagnosed case of Covid-19.)

On 11 March, he visited the emergency room with flu-like symptoms, Wilcox said. Over the next few days, his breathing became more labored and he began to cough up blood. He was rushed to the hospital on 13 March, where he subsequently received a Covid-19 diagnosis. Simmons died on 17 March.

Daisy Doronila, 60

Doronila was among dozens of people infected with the coronavirus at a Hudson county jail

Occupation: Nurse

Place of work: Hudson county correctional facility in Kearny, New Jersey

Date of death: 5 April 2020

Daisy Doronila treated her patients at the Hudson county correctional facility, a New Jersey prison, with the utmost kindness, no matter what they had done.

“There would be people there for the most heinous crimes,” said her daughter, Denise Rendor, 28, “but they would just melt towards my mother because she really was there to give them care with no judgment.”

Doronila emigrated from the Philippines as a young nurse. She loved fashionable clothes and eating seafood on the waterfront in New York City, her daughter said.

“Daisy could handle herself,” said the county director of corrections, Ron Edwards, describing her as sophisticated, intelligent and compassionate. “If someone got obnoxious with her, she’d put them in their place and call for help if she needed to.”

Like many jails and prisons, the facility where Doronila worked has been hit hard by the virus: as of 10 April, 27 inmates and 68 staff members had tested positive. Four people who worked at the jail, including Doronila, have died, according to officials.

Doronila, a devout Catholic who had been planning a trip to Israel with friends from church, developed a cough in mid-March. One doctor told her she probably had strep throat; another said fever wasn’t high enough to merit a coronavirus test.

She offered to return to work, but as the days went by, her condition grew worse. On 21 March, she was hospitalized for shortness of breath. The next day, she was put on a ventilator. Two weeks later, she passed away.

Rendor said she and her mother were looking forward to sharing the next chapters in life together. For her mother, retirement at 65. For Rendor, marriage and perhaps starting her own family.

“It was about to get really, really good,” she said.

Jeff Baumbach, 57

Unable to gather to mourn, Baumbach’s friends drove by his house shining flashlights in his honor

Occupation: Nurse

Place of work: St Joseph’s medical center in Stockton, California

Date of death: 31 March 2020

Jeff Baumbach knew the risks of coronavirus, but as a nurse for 28 years he was also accustomed to being around infectious disease. “He’d worked in the ICU. He was exposed to so many things, and we never got anything,” said his wife and fellow nurse, Karen. Baumbach even sent a dry text to Karen: “I love wearing a mask every day.”

In March, Baumbach was notified that a co-worker had Covid-19. He soon began to develop symptoms; he and Karen tested positive. Karen came down with body aches and congestion. Jeff had a fever and cough.

Their home, once the site of countless family brunches and barbecues, where Jeff and his children solved huge jigsaw puzzles, was now sealed off from the outside world. Their daughter Kaila, 26, moved out as a precaution, and she didn’t communicate with her dad when he was sick. “I thought he was invincible,” Kaila said.

On 26 March, Karen brought Baumbach to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia. He chose to recuperate at home. On 31 March, he collapsed in the bathroom. “It went downhill really fast,” said Karen, who took him to the hospital. Unable to enter the building, she stayed in her car and received updates by phone. Kaila waited in another car nearby.

Baumbach was connected to a ventilator, but it had little effect. Eventually, Karen was allowed to don full protective gear and say goodbye in person. She returned home alone, still in quarantine.

The next evening, Kaila asked dozens of friends and family members to drive along her parents’ street and shine their phone flashlights. Filled with grief and gratitude, Karen cried as she peered out of an upstairs window at the glittering lines of cars crawling in both directions past her home.

Debbie Accad, 72

Accad was the ‘pillar’ of her family back in the Philippines and spent decades caring for US veterans

Occupation: Clinical nursing coordinator

Place of work: Detroit VA medical center in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 30 March 2020

Nurse Divina “Debbie” Accad cared for military veterans for over 25 years and was just a few weeks from retiring when the virus struck.

On 16 March, Accad, 72, a clinical nursing coordinator at the Detroit VA medical center, told relatives that she felt ill. Four days later, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. She told her family that she had tested positive for Covid-19, and asked them to pray for her. The family felt helpless watching their beloved matriarch suffer from afar, said her niece, April Amada, who lives in the Philippines.

Accad was born in Alimodian, a Philippine town known for its sweet bananas. The eldest of four children, she graduated from Central Philippine University with a nursing degree in 1969.

Two years later, she moved to Chicago through a “fly now, pay later” program, joining tens of thousands of Filipino nurses who have migrated to the United States. She later relocated to Taylor, Michigan, where she married William Accad, with whom she raised four children.

Accad was the “pillar of the family”, Amada said. She sent money home to relatives, and put Amada’s mother through nursing school. A visit from Accad – known to relatives as Tita Debbie – meant unli-kainan, or “unlimited food”. Accad served up big American breakfasts and spicy kielbasa with cabbage.

Mark, Accad’s son, said his mother had diabetes, a risk factor for Covid-19 complications. He believes his mother was exposed by infected co-workers, though that has not been confirmed. The Department of Veterans Affairs is facing serious shortages in personal protective equipment for workers, according to internal memos obtained by the Wall Street Journal, though the VA has told reporters that it was taking proper precautions.

Accad “died doing what she loved most – caring for people”, said Mark.

['Jessica Glenza'],2020-05-05,New York reports 15 cases of rare illness in children possibly linked to Covid-19,"More than 100 cases of unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries as 15 New York patients aged two to 15 hospitalized

New York City’s health department has reported 15 cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that may be linked to coronavirus infections.

More than 100 cases of the unusual illness have now emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland investigating the condition.

Fifteen patients aged between two and 15 were hospitalized between 29 April and 3 May with illnesses compatible with the syndrome, the New York City health department said in a statement. “All patients had subjective or measured fever and more than half reported rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea,” it added.

No deaths were reported.

More cases of rare syndrome in children reported globally Read more

The syndrome resembles Kawasaki disease, authorities said, an inflammatory condition of the blood vessels in which children develop high fever, rash on the back, chest and abdomen, bloodshot eyes, swollen hands and feet, swollen lymph glands and swelling around the mouth and lips.

Kawasaki disease is rare. About 3,000 children are diagnosed with the disease each year. There are 74 million children younger than 18 in the US.

The cause of Kawasaki disease is not known, although some research papers have linked its trigger to viral infection. It was first diagnosed in Japanese children in the 1960s and does not appear to be either contagious or hereditary, according to the American Heart Association.

The New York City health department ordered pediatricians whose patients have a fever for four days or more, symptoms consistent with Kawasaki disease or symptoms similar to toxic shock syndrome to report the cases immediately, for all patients younger than 15. The health department also urged pediatricians to refer patients to infectious disease specialists or rheumatologists.

It remains unclear what connection the disease might have to Sars-Cov-2, the coronavirus which causes Covid-19, and has hit New York City particularly hard. All 15 of the children were tested for Covid-19. Ten were negative.

Although children can spread the coronavirus, they are much less likely to contract it, and it has relatively mild effects on them. In its warning about the inflammatory condition, the UK’s Pediatric Intensive Care Society said: “Serious illness as a result of Covid-19 still appears to be a very rare event in children.”

However, since the pandemic, doctors have noted patients with Kawasaki disease who also have Covid-19. The earliest known case involved a six-month-old in California, who came to the hospital with symptoms of Kawasaki disease and was also diagnosed with Covid-19. The case report was peer-reviewed and is expected to be published in the journal Hospital Pediatrics.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/children-coronavirus-illness-new-york-rare-cases
['Oliver Milman'],2020-05-05,Wendy's pulls burgers off the menu at some locations due to meat shortage,"As many as one in five restaurants in the giant Wendy’s fast-food chain across the US has had to stop serving hamburgers or other beef-based menu items, in the latest sign of an escalating threat of a national meat shortage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Wendy’s customers in various US locations have reported being unable to purchase burgers at restaurants belonging to one of the world’s largest hamburger chains. The fast-food company has confirmed it is experiencing problems with beef suppliers and that “some of our menu items may be temporarily limited at some restaurants in this current environment”.

About 1,000 Wendy’s restaurants, a fifth of the company’s American outlets, are not serving burgers and other beef dishes, according to financial analyst firm Stephens. Some states are particularly affected, with restaurants in Ohio, Michigan and New York running extremely low on fresh meat, while other states such as Arizona and Nevada aren’t as badly hit.

Wendy’s meatless woes are a symptom of a broader slowdown in America’s meat production as thousands of workers in processing plants fall sick from Covid-19 and facilities shutter due to fears of further spread of the virus.

Donald Trump attempted to rectify the situation by signing an executive order on 28 April that aims to keep meat-processing plants in operation. But the order is not expected to resolve the slowdown as it won’t protect workers from a highly contagious disease spreading in the crowded environs of a processing facility.

Dozens of workers have already died from Covid-19, according to unions, with many employees expressing fear that they are on the frontline of a dangerous coronavirus hotspot.

Tyson Foods, one of America’s largest meat producers, said its output of pork is down by 50% despite measures it claims it has taken to physically distance workers and ensure the supply of meat. The company recently took out a full-page advert in the New York Times to warn that the “food supply chain is breaking” due to a highly unusual situation where both the production and distribution of meat has been crippled by a public health emergency.

Over the past month, Tyson has closed three major plants in Iowa and one in Indiana after huge numbers of employees fell sick from Covid-19. Its beef-processing operations in Washington state and Nebraska have also shut down after a spate of infections.

A weekly report from the US Department of Agriculture on 27 April illustrated the national decline in meat output, with beef production down 25% on the same period last year, while pork production slumped 15%. This shortfall will lead to price increases in some restaurants and stores and shortages in others, analysts said.

“You’re going to see empty shelves,” Steve Meyer, an economist for agricultural risk management firm Kerns and Associates, told the Washington Post. “Not all the time, and it won’t last forever.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/wendys-burgers-beef-meat-shortage-coronavirus
['Mario Koran'],2020-05-05,Co-living in a pandemic: how I'm surviving life with 48 roommates,"With Bay Area rent soaring, Mario Koran moved to Starcity, where kitchens and bathrooms are shared. Is socially distancing possible in ‘a college dorm for grown-ups’?

I’m living with 48 roommates in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Co-living makes physical distancing all but impossible: we touch the same door handles, awkwardly navigate shared spaces and binge-watch Tiger King in the same TV lounges.

The fear of coronavirus hasn’t so far driven me to move out or reignite a grueling apartment search. But neither can I say with authority just how safe co-living is in the middle of an outbreak.

Before I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in September, I was aware of the region’s reputation for towering costs of living. But I wasn’t prepared for the grinding hustle to find affordable housing. Even renting a room in someone else’s apartment felt more like a job interview with prospective roommates.

'With restrictions easing, how do we tell someone we don’t want them in our bubble?' Read more

I bounced between temporary rooms until I could find a more permanent place, living out of a suitcase, storing frozen meals in strangers’ refrigerators. At one point, I was willing to take a partitioned-off section of a living room someone was renting as a bedroom for $1,500. No dice: the tenants decided to “move in another direction” in terms of a roommate.

When I found Starcity – a tech-enabled real estate company that’s part of a new generation of co-living spaces – it was, by all measures, an improvement to my living situation. It looks and feels a lot like a college dorm for grown-ups. The building is clean and well-lit, with a low-key, budget-trendy style. Beds and kitchen appliances are new. Showers don’t inexplicably scald or give me frostbite. Laundry, soap and internet fees are included in rent. My room is my own space. The flexible lease was a major selling point and the price was right, too.

My apartment in Oakland rents for $1,250 a month – about $600 less than the median rent for a studio in Oakland and about $1,000 less than a typical one-bedroom.

This is how, at the age of 38, I effectively returned to my freshman year of college. I made a new group of pals and began to settle in. Then came the coronavirus.

Is it possible to protect yourself?

In spite of the pandemic, new residents continue to move into Starcity. But I’ve also seen a good number of residents leaving with packed bags – some for good, others planning to wait out the worst of the pandemic with friends or family.

A couple of weeks ago, one woman sent me a message asking if I had any intel on penalties for breaking the lease. She couldn’t do this co-living situation, she wrote, especially during Covid-19. Days later, she was gone.

Roshan Ramankutty, a software engineer in the sales department of Square who has become a friend, decided the best option for him is living with nearby family members.

“For me, it came down to: if the worst case scenario was to happen, how would I best be able to support and be supported? And that’s ultimately with my family,” he said.

Jon Dishotksy, Starcity’s 36-year-old CEO and co-founder, says the company has received only a half-dozen lease cancellations since the lockdowns started. One Starcity staff member tested positive for Covid-19, he said, but so far there have been no known outbreaks in Starcity communities.

In a co-living environment, refrigerator handles, faucets and elevator buttons are all common touch-points. Even a trip to the kitchen to fetch a cup of coffee could put you in close proximity to your neighbors.

So is it actually possible to protect yourself from an outbreak in a place like Starcity?

Paula Cannon, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, agrees that co-living certainly isn’t ideal during a pandemic but says there are ways to minimize risk.

“If I was living there as a virologist, I would be your very annoying neighbor sticking leaflets under people’s doors that say ‘here’s what Starcity is doing’ and ‘here’s what we can do as neighbors’,” she said.

Cannon suggests, for example, creating a schedule for the kitchen, so residents can space out meal times and reduce exposure to others. Cleaning and disinfecting the kitchen before and after each use would help. So would making your bedroom your castle and keeping to it as much as possible.

That, she says, requires residents to buy into a shared contract and agree to do their part to protect themselves and their neighbors.

Health guidance aside, sheltering in place at Starcity hasn’t always been convenient. Under lockdown, mail and packages to our building have stopped.

Dishotsky explains that receiving packages has been a challenge across Starcity communities, partly because they repurpose underused hotels or commercial spaces that lack places to store packages.

Weekdays see my neighbors waiting by its front door for deliveries for hours on end. Many packages have been rerouted, delayed, or stopped altogether. Hand-drawn notes decorate our front door, reminding delivery drivers: “THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A sign aimed at delivery drivers. Photograph: Mario Koran/The Guardian

It’s a small issue compared with the grim toll coronavirus has taken elsewhere. But it’s a valid concern at a time when deliveries remain one of the few ways for people to buy essentials.

So far, there’s been no groundswell among residents to adopt a kitchen schedule like the one Cannon suggests, but that could change should someone in the building get sick.

While some residents have been keeping more to their rooms – emerging only occasionally, and with increasing edginess, to use the kitchen or shower – others see roommates as members of a traditional household and have given up trying to maintain six feet of separation.

Even Cannon recognizes that self-isolating at all times could defeat the fundamental benefit of group quarantine.

Sensor taps and no door handles: Covid-19 shows it's time to rethink public toilets Read more

“Part of the draw of places like this is the sense of community, which helps people who have become near-suicidal because of isolation,” she says.

Indeed, having roommates has been instrumental in helping me beat back the madness that encroaches after days of solitude.

We’ve passed time in childish and inane ways, spending nights eating Pringles and playing video games. We put on Pink Floyd albums and shot hoops at the downstairs basketball court until the wee hours of the morning. Suppertime sees a small troop of us rallying behind João, a Brazilian restaurant manager who’s been laid off during the outbreak but continues to cook for those of us dug into the trenches of co-living alongside him.

And lockdown has shown me – as a hopeless introvert – how much I’ve come to appreciate having, even need, others around.

The housing model of the future?

Dishotsky, who helped launch Starcity in 2016, grew up just south of San Francisco, in Silicon Valley’s Palo Alto. His father, a Stanford professor, rented out rooms to students, rooting his son in co-living early on.

After a decade in commercial real estate, Dishotsky said he wanted to create something to help meet the Bay Area’s most pressing need: a healthy stock of affordable housing options.

“I saw a way to make a dent in the housing supply and keep it affordable so a city doesn’t push out its restaurant servers, postal workers, journalists – the ones who make up the backbone and underlying culture of our cities,” Dishotsky explains.

Over the years, Starcity has been featured in the New York Times, SF Curbed and CityLab, with stories exploring the degree to which a concept that once seemed absurd – a group of adults living together like college students – could be an answer to the lack of affordable housing.

It’s also been subject to skepticism. In 2016 a local news outlet described Starcity as taking advantage of a loophole in city regulations that allows developers to buy single-room occupancy hotels, or SROs, flip them, then raise rents from, say, $450 to $2,100 a month at one San Francisco location.

“That was before we understood the full impact of converting SROs,” Dishotsky says of the criticism, adding that Starcity allowed previous residents at that address to continue to rent at the prices they paid before the building was renovated.

Since then, Dishotsky has been outspoken on the issue of displacement, writing in 2018 op-ed that he refuses to purchase or manage buildings that previously served low-income residents and calling on other developers to do the same.

Dishotsky believes Starcity’s model is resilient enough to outlast the pandemic, even as companies like WeWork, which offers shared office spaces, looks to scale back communal areas moving forward.

He sees co-living as a model of the future – one that will one day be embraced not just by single adults but whole families attracted to communal living and shared childcare.

As CEO, Dishotsky’s optimism isn’t surprising. But Cannon, as a virologist, backs him up.

“I would be wary of attributing too much to how much coronavirus will change society. We have very short memories. Once we get a vaccine, and we will, people will re-emerge and things will go, mostly, back to normal,” Cannon says.

The silver lining, Cannon said, could be getting residents to embrace the social contract of taking precautions to look out for their neighbors’ health as well as their own.

“These things build trust and a sense of community,” she says. “It’s the underlying human experiences that will ultimately get us through this moment.”

As for me, I don’t plan to stay at Starcity forever. The lockdown will eventually pass and one day I might even find a place to settle down. Until then, I’m leaning into the moment – even if that looks a lot like it did when I was when I was 19 years old.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/co-living-coronavirus-roommates-starcity
['Heather Stewart'],2020-05-05,UK coronavirus adviser Neil Ferguson resigns after breaking lockdown rules,"Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling helped shape Britain’s coronavirus lockdown strategy, has quit as a government adviser after flouting the rules by receiving visits from his lover at his home.

Ferguson runs the group of scientists at Imperial College London whose projections helped persuade ministers of the need to impose stringent physical distancing rules, or risk the NHS being overwhelmed.

In a statement on Tuesday, he said he was resigning his post on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), over an “error of judgment”.

The Daily Telegraph revealed that Antonia Staats had crossed London from her family home to visit him on at least two occasions since lockdown measures were imposed, on 30 March and 8 April. Friends told the newspaper that Staats did not believe their actions to be hypocritical because she considered the households to be one.

The visits clearly contravene the government’s “stay at home, save lives” message, which urges people to remain within their family groups and not mix with members of other households.

“I accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in Sage,” Ferguson said. “I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms.

“I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.”

Government advisers have repeatedly warned the public against meetings with members of other households. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, when asked whether partners living separately could visit each other, said on 24 March: “If the two halves of a couple are currently in separate households, ideally they should stay in those households.”

She added: “The alternative might be that, for quite a significant period going forwards, they should test the strength of their relationship and decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.”

Ferguson had become a familiar figure in media interviews during the lockdown, helping to explain the scientific rationale for government decision-making. He contracted the virus in mid-March, apparently after attending meetings in Westminster.

“Sigh. Developed a slight dry but persistent cough yesterday and self-isolated even though I felt fine. Then developed high fever at 4am today. There is a lot of Covid-19 in Westminster,” he tweeted on 18 March.

Ferguson’s resignation follows questions over the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, who travelled to one of his homes outside his constituency to spend lockdown there, and drove to his parents’ house to drop off food and medicines.

Colleagues have described Ferguson, 51 – whose background is in modelling rather than medicine – as a workaholic.

His colleague Christl Donnelly told the Guardian earlier this year: “He works harder than anyone I have ever met. He is simultaneously attending very large numbers of meetings while running the group from an organisational point of view and doing programming himself. Any one of those things could take somebody their full time.

“One of his friends said he should slow down – this is a marathon not a sprint. He said he is going to do the marathon at sprint speed. It is not just work ethic – it is also energy. He seems to be able to keep going. He must sleep a bit, but I think not much.”

Staats, 38, is believed to work for an activism organisation.

Imperial’s modelling claimed that as many as 500,000 deaths could result in the UK from the Covid-19 outbreak if the government failed to implement stringent enough distancing measures, and Ferguson warned recently that lifting lockdown prematurely could cost 100,000 lives.

A government spokesman confirmed Ferguson’s resignation but did not comment further.

A statement from Imperial College London said Ferguson “continues to focus on his important research”.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules

His resignation is a huge blow to the government’s authority on the pandemic.

It was his work that prompted a seismic shift in government policy in the UK response from essentially letting the virus spread through the population to the wholescale stay-at-home policy now in place.

The evidence that changed the government’s policy came from the centre he founded with colleagues at Imperial College, the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, which collaborates with the World Health Organization.

His decision to resign from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), after allowing his lover to visit him at home during the lockdown while lecturing the public on the need for strict social distancing, will leave a gaping hole for ministers to fill.

The high-profile figures who got into hot water over lockdown rules Read more

Ferguson, 51, had only just finished a two-week spell self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus before being confronted by the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday.

It will be a crushing fall for the slim, bespectacled, intense workaholic whose face has become a familiar sight on television screens over the past six weeks.

As head of the department at Imperial College London since 2012 Ferguson carries with him 20 years of experience of studying pathogen outbreaks – foot and mouth disease in 2001, Sars in 2003, swine flu in 2011, Mers in 2012, and Ebola and Zika in 2014.

He modelled the spread of all those outbreaks, advising five UK prime ministers in the process. But all that seems like a practice run for 2020.

In February data began emerging from northern Italy, the first place in Europe to feel the force of the novel coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in November.

“This virus is probably the one that concerns me the most, of everything I’ve worked on,” Ferguson said in an early TV interview mid-February, when ministers were still focused on how they would implement Brexit.

On 16 March, about a month after the earlier interview, Ferguson delivered a 20-page paper to Johnson which transformed the UK’s strategy and has been credited with saving tens of thousands of lives.

He told ministers that more than 500,000 people could die if the government continued with its stated strategy of allowing the disease to spread.

Eight days later, the government scrapped the strategy in favour of suppressing the virus with a lockdown to save lives and protect the NHS.

Ferguson’s work has gone on to form the strategies pursued by the White House, in the US, and the governments of France and Germany, according to reports.

He is dedicated to his profession, according to his colleague Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology based at Oxford University most of the time, as well as at Imperial. She said: “He works harder than anyone I have ever met. He is simultaneously attending very large numbers of meetings while running the group from an organisational point of view and doing programming himself. Any one of those things could take somebody their full time.

“One of his friends said he should slow down – this is a marathon not a sprint. He said he is going to do the marathon at sprint speed. It is not just work ethic, it is also energy. He seems to be able to keep going. He must sleep a bit, but I think not much.”

Ferguson was one of a number of people at the highest levels of government to contract the virus. On 17 March, he took part in a 5pm press conference at No 10 Downing Street, greeting senior members of Johnson’s cabinet before delivering a speech and leaving.

The next morning he woke with a dry cough and tested positive for Covid-19. In the days that followed, the prime minister, his chief adviser Dominic Cummings, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, also reported symptoms of the virus.

In a statement on Tuesday, Ferguson expressed his regret for ignoring the government’s guidance.

“I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic,” he said.

The World Health Organization has urged countries to look for more early cases of Covid-19 and urged a full exploration of the pandemic’s origins and early path, as Germany took preventive action to head off any future rise in infections.

Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state Read more

As European countries continued to ease their lockdown restrictions, the WHO said news that a French hospital re-testing old samples from pneumonia patients had identified a coronavirus infection dating to 27 December, weeks before France confirmed its first cases, “gives us a whole new picture on everything”.

A spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, urged more countries to look for other early incidences of the virus, which was first reported by Chinese authorities to the WHO on 31 December and not previously thought to have spread to Europe until January.

“The findings help to better understand the potential virus circulation,” Lindmeier said, adding that it was “really, really important” to gain a fuller understanding of the early path of the virus and that further WHO missions to China may be needed.

Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said the country – one of the few in Europe not to impose a mandatory lockdown – would not carry out retrospective testing yet, but also called for a full investigation of how the virus spread in China.

It was important to know “how it behaved in the early stages of its spread”, Tegnell told Sweden’s TT news agency, particularly “if it it was an individual spread from an animal to a person, or if it spread to a group of people over a longer period of time.”

The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has alleged the Trump administration has “evidence” that the virus emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, but scientists have advised the WHO that it is of animal origin.

With several European countries now cautiously lifting lockdown measures, Angela Merkel’s office announced on Tuesday that local authorities in Germany would have to close schools and all but non-essential shops once again if the number of new cases rose to more than 35 in every 100,000 in a particular area within a seven-day period.

The move came on the eve of a key meeting between the chancellor and leaders of the country’s 16 states, several of which – particularly in the less hard-hit east – want restrictions lifted faster. Germany’s largest state, Bavaria, said on Tuesday it would allow restaurants to resume outdoor service from 18 May, with indoor dining permitted a week later.

The health minister of Austria – one of the first countries to start lifting restrictions, three weeks ago – declared its outbreak was under control, with the daily increase in new infections down to 0.2%.

The situation was “very constant, very stable,” Rudolf Anschober said, adding that the first phase of exiting the country’s strict, month-long lockdown had succeeded “excellently”. People must, however, remain vigilant, he said.

Small shops reopened in Austria in mid-April, with face masks mandatory in shops and public transport. Bigger shops followed last weekend, classes in schools are gradually resuming, and restaurants are expected to reopen by mid-May.

France’s president said it was too early to say if foreign holidays would be possible this summer. As the country prepares to lift its first lockdown restrictions on 11 May, Emmanuel Macron said travel would be limited “even during the summer holidays. We will remain among Europeans, and maybe we will have to limit that even more.”

Spanish schools, meanwhile, may need to operate at half-capacity when classes resume in September, the country’s education minister said. “Until we have a remedy or a vaccine, the only tool we have to fight the virus is confinement,” Isabel Celaá told the Spanish newspaper 20 Minutos.

“We can’t jeopardise all the gains we’ve made. If we’ve got 3 million primary school children, each accompanied by an adult, turning up at school, you can imagine the huge movement that involves. If they all turn up at once, we won’t be able to maintain the required distance.”

Separate studies in Israel and the Netherlands, meanwhile, claimed to have created antibodies that could eventually help treat or prevent the development of Covid-19, a potentially significant development until a vaccine becomes available.

The Israeli defence minister announced a state-run research centre had developed an antibody that “can neutralise [the coronavirus] inside carriers’ bodies”, while a Dutch-led team of scientists said they had managed to halt infection in a lab setting.

The Guardian understands the antibody has not yet been trialled on humans, however.

['Kate Connolly'],2020-05-05,"Germany reopens museums, galleries and gardens with social distancing rules","Berlin’s botanical gardens, one of the city’s most loved green spaces, reopened its gates to the public on Tuesday with May flowers in bloom as Germans began to get used to leisure activities under a strict regime of face coverings, physical distancing and online booking.

As the gardens welcomed their first visitors since mid March, visitors were promised “the fragrance of nectar in your nostrils, the sound of birdsong in your ear” in a welcome posted on the gardens’ online ticket shop.

Germany’s six-week lockdown had confined many of the city’s residents to their flats or to struggling to keep physical distance rules in overcrowded green spaces.

No more than 1,000 visitors will be allowed in the botanical grounds at one time, and the glasshouses will be closed because physical distancing rules would be difficult to keep.

Petra Scharf, a regular visitor before the shutdown, said she had counted the days for it to reopen. “I have a balcony, I’m lucky, but I have missed the expanse of colour and and the smell of the blossom,” the 57-year-old said by phone after her morning visit, during which she said she had kept a safe distance from the friend who accompanied her, pretending to prod him with an umbrella if he got too close.

Elsewhere across Germany cultural attractions were slowly beginning to reopen.

In Potsdam, south-west of Berlin, the Museum Barberini art gallery was preparing to open its doors on Wednesday, after the lockdown interrupted an exhibition of Monet landscapes only three weeks after it opened.

The museum said it had developed a “comprehensive catalogue of protective and hygiene measures”, which include limiting the number of visitors; and visitors having to book online and be guided in a strict circular path around the exhibition for a maximum stay of two hours. Audio guides will no longer be for hire while security guards will warn visitors not to get too close to the paintings and each other.

“We are very happy to be able to finally make the museum accessible again,” said Ortrud Westheider, the Barberini’s director. “We are also very aware of the responsibility we have towards our guests and employees.”

In Dresden the Sempergalerie, one of the country’s biggest tourist attractions, holding a collection of old-master paintings, also reopened on Tuesday. It had reopened at the end of February following a seven-year renovation, only to be closed because of the coronavirus lockdown two weeks later.

A lengthy queue had built up in front of the Sempergalerie’s entrance before it opened at 11am. A museum employee explained the hygiene regulations to the visitors, including the obligatory wearing of masks, or nose and mouth coverings, before entry.

Commercial galleries across Germany have also started opening their doors. State museums, including tourist magnets such as the Pergamon, the Alte Nationagalerie, and Gemälde Galerie, as well as a range of research institutes and libraries, are due to reopen on 12 May. Visitors are asked, in almost all cases, to book a time slot online. Digital guided tours during the lockdown will remain available for those whose health will not permit them to visit the museums.

Elsewhere zoos, several of which suggested that a lack of income meant they might have to kill their animals, have been allowed to reopen for the past week but with considerable restrictions.

Nightclubs, concert halls and other cultural institutes where physical distancing is virtually impossible, have so far had no indication from the government as to when and under what conditions they could reopen.

A meeting between the government and the country’s 16 state leaders on Wednesday is expected to make decisions on schools and nurseries as well as sporting activities, and to indicate when and under what conditions restaurants and tourist attractions might be allowed to reopen across the country.

On Tuesday Bavaria announced a phased reopening of its outdoor restaurants. Several states announced that rambling and hiking was allowed once again, as were other outdoor physical activities not requiring physical contact, such as golf.

['Ap In Moscow'],2020-05-05,Russia domestic violence cases more than double under lockdown,"Figures from human rights commissioner paint different picture to that provided by police

Reported cases of domestic violence in Russia have more than doubled during the country’s coronavirus lockdown, according to the Russian human rights commissioner, who painted a different picture to that provided by police data.

Complaints and reports made to Russian non-governmental organisations spiked from roughly 6,000 in March to more than 13,000 in April, Tatyana Moskalkova said on Tuesday. “The picture is rather non-optimistic,” the RIA Novosti news agency quoted her as saying.

Her statement came a week after Russian police said the number of domestic crimes fell by 13% during the lockdown, compared to the same month last year – a report dismissed by some women’s rights campaigners as inaccurate as many victims do not report domestic abuse to the police.

Growing numbers of domestic abuse complaints have been reported all across Europe after governments instituted lockdowns and ordered residents to stay at home, as the frustrations of enforced isolation, often fuelled by increased use of alcohol and dire economic constraints, aggravated existing tensions or triggered new ones. Women and children are usually the victims.

In Spain, calls to the helpline for domestic violence victims were up 30.7% between 14 March, when the lockdown was announced, and 15 April in year-on-year terms.

In the UK it was found that calls to a national domestic abuse helpline jumped by 49% in early April compared with the average in the same period in previous years. France’s National Federation of Women Solidarity said the hotline they ran had received double to triple the usual daily number of calls since France imposed a lockdown on 17 March. In Greece, where the lockdown started on 23 March, a government helpline received nearly four times as many complaints in April as in March.

In many countries government officials are taking steps to address the problem.

The French government introduced a text messaging number and a Twitter account victims can reach out to in addition to the usual police number. Moreover, authorities tasked pharmacies and a number of chain supermarkets to arrange points of contact for domestic abuse victims. Britain pledged £76m to help vulnerable children and victims of domestic violence.

But rights groups argue that Russia has failed to take any steps to stop domestic violence. The Kremlin imposed a nationwide lockdown in late March. Almost immediately, women’s rights advocates sounded the alarm about a surge of domestic violence cases.

In a letter to the government, nine non-governmental organisations asked officials to set up more shelters, instruct police officers about the importance of responding to domestic violence calls and help victims get medical, legal and psychological help.

Nothing has been done so far, said Olga Gnezdilova, a lawyer with the Russian Justice Initiative, one of the groups that signed the letter.

Domestic violence has been rampant in Russia for years, and so far little political will has been shown to tackle the issue. Despite the fact that, according to police data, up to 40% of all violent crimes are committed within families, in 2017 Vladimir Putin downgraded simple assault against a family member from a criminal offence to a misdemeanour, punishable by a $76 fine.

['Chris Humphrey In Hanoi'],2020-05-06,"Vietnam crushed the coronavirus outbreak, but now faces severe economic test","Strict quarantining and widespread testing have helped the country avoid disaster, but with tourism on hold the nation’s future is uncertain

Vietnam didn’t just flatten its coronavirus curve, it crushed it. No deaths have been reported, official case numbers have plateaued at just 271, and no community transmissions of the virus have been reported in the last two weeks. On 23 April, the nation eased lockdowns in its major cities and life is gradually returning to normal. It is a stark contrast to many other nations including the US, where more Americans have died from Covid-19 than during the entire Vietnam war.

Kidong Park, the World Health Organisation’s representative to Vietnam, has praised the country’s response to the crisis.

Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000 Read more

Quarantining tens of thousands in military-style camps and vigorous contact tracing procedures have helped Vietnam to avoid the disasters unfolding in Europe and the US. After testing over 213,000 people, the nation has the highest test-per-confirmed-case ratio of any country in the world. A creative public information campaign featuring viral handwashing songs and propaganda-style art helped, but it was decisive early action – hastened by a government praised for its response to Sars in 2003 – that proved most effective.

Vietnam’s first two confirmed cases of Covid-19 appeared in late January. On 1 February, Vietnam Airlines ceased all flights to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong and the border with China was shut days later. After a fresh wave of new infections in March, all international flights were grounded and a nationwide lockdown commenced on 1 April. While other nations announced lockdowns to deal with existing crises, Vietnam enacted one to prevent one.

Second waves of the virus have, however, already hit Japan and Hong Kong. To mitigate the risk of a fresh outbreak occurring in Vietnam, wearing face masks in public remains mandatory and gatherings of more than 30 individuals are banned, as are festivals, religious ceremonies and sporting events.

Park stresses the importance of education about the virus at community level, along with strengthening preventative measures in health facilities, offices, schools and other places where it is essential for people to go regularly.

But he warned of the economic consequences and this likely influenced the government’s decision to end the lockdown on 23 April.

Many non-essential services, such as bars and karaoke parlours, are still closed. Some will never recover. Constraints have been lifted for shops, hotels and restaurants, yet in a nation where tourism accounts for 6% of GDP, the future looks increasingly uncertain – especially when nobody has a clear idea of when borders will reopen.

A report released by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) last month said at least 10 million Vietnamese could lose their jobs or face reduced income in the second quarter of 2020. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a growth rate of 2.7% for Vietnam in 2020, a drop from around 7% last year.

In early April, the government announced a $2.5bn support package for Vietnam’s poor, with the most vulnerable receiving $76 per week. “Rice ATMs” and “zero dong stores” have been set up in major cities to assist those hardest hit, yet even when combined with additional government funding, such support only goes so far.

A Hanoi-based economist, Nguyen Van Trang, says the path ahead looks ominous. “Incredibly difficult decisions lie ahead on how and when to reopen the country…,” she says, but adds that despite external risks Vietnam has begun to restore manufacturing, services and retail sectors. “The internal resilience is huge. A large part of the population survived through hardships during the war, so they will be able to bounce back very quickly.”

For some of Vietnam’s most vulnerable, the situation looks bleak. With attention diverted towards the pandemic, NGOs have been hit hard. Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation, an organisation that works with street children in Hanoi and rescues victims of human trafficking from China, has seen donations plummet. Skye Maconachie, the organization’s joint chief executive, says the crisis has already led to an increase in homelessness and hunger.

“Many of the children and families we work with were already in poverty or in crisis, so now they are reaching a breaking point,” Maconachie says. “Traffickers prey on vulnerable people, so we expect to see an increase in human trafficking and labour exploitation over the coming months.”

Whatever the future holds, Vietnam, a nation of 96 million, appears to have contained the virus. As of Wednesday, Singapore had 19,410 confirmed cases of Covid-19 – the highest in south-east Asia – and 18 deaths, while Indonesia has more than 12,000 cases and 872 deaths. As Vietnam emerges from lockdown, the eyes of the world will be watching.

“The fight against Covid-19 is ongoing and the next wave is always possible as outbreaks are still reported globally.” Vietnam, Park says, “should not lose its grip.”

"['Alastair Gee', 'Dani Anguiano']",2020-05-05,'It sounded evil': inside the eerie moment California’s deadliest wildfire began,"Four miles east of Paradise, California as the crow flies, fire chief Matt McKenzie awoke in confusion at 5am on Thursday, 8 November 2018. It sounded like rain hitting the metal roof of the fire station, but there was none in the forecast.

It took him a moment to realize that it was pine needles being flung by a strange wind – not the usual intermittent gusts he was accustomed to hearing swoosh down the canyon, but a sustained, jet-engine roar. He got up and went to the station’s small kitchen, where he put the coffee on and started dicing potatoes and onions for his crew’s breakfast.

A 20-year veteran of Cal Fire, California’s state firefighting force, McKenzie had never rested easy at Jarbo Gap. Its location alone was enough to quicken the heart. The station was atop a high ridge overlooking the canyon in which a branch of the Feather River flowed southward, at about the point the canyon and the river make an abrupt, 90-degree turn to the east. Winds streaming down the canyon would run straight into this turn and spill out, moaning over the top of the station, especially at night, when canyon winds commonly pick up. Fires in the region often start in this steep and inaccessible declivity, served by a single main road that meanders alongside the water.

At 6.15am, the electric company PG&E experienced a power outage on a high-voltage line that traversed the canyon. Only one customer was affected – a hydroelectric station located in the canyon that was operated by a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area. At about 6.28am, a PG&E supervisor driving through the canyon six miles north of Jarbo Gap saw a fire that he estimated to measure 100 sq ft in a clearing below the transmission line, and radioed a nearby company facility, which conveyed the alert to emergency services.

This was the first warning of what would become the deadliest US wildfire in a century, claiming 85 lives and ravaging an entire town. Sparked in a region desiccated by drought, a few hours north of San Francisco, it would also be a harbinger of how the climate crisis is transforming the natural world.

Before long, McKenzie’s phone lit up with a text informing him of an ignition. He opened the back door to the kitchen and the wind ripped it right out of his hands. Although he expected to catch the smell of the fire, all he got was the dry pines. He and five other firefighters headed into the canyon in the dark in two trucks. It was a place McKenzie had known his entire life – as a kid growing up in the nearby town of Oroville, he would come up here with his dad to hunt, fish, or log a Christmas tree in the high, green solitude. It took them about fifteen minutes to reach the fire, going as fast as they could while keeping the engines on the road and avoiding nosediving into the canyon. As soon as they got there, McKenzie was dismayed.

We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back Read more

The flames – sheltered and low to the ground, a dusky orange – were on the wrong side of the river. McKenzie had been hoping that they would be on the canyon’s east side, where they would be accessible from the two-lane highway he was on. Instead they were west of the river, off a dirt track called Camp Creek Road. It was an impossible location. Camp Creek Road was hewn roughly into the side of the valley and in some places had been washed out by floods. It was so narrow that a fire truck could pull in its wing mirrors and still probably scrape the rock outcroppings. It could take another forty minutes just to carefully creep down to the blaze, and once they reached it there would be nowhere to turn around, meaning the truck would have to reverse out. That would be agonizingly difficult under any circumstances, but especially in the face of flames being wind-whipped toward them.

It was a situation in which McKenzie would want to call in aircraft to drop water or retardant, but he knew that wasn’t an option: it was too dark and the wind too savage. “It was so close to a highway yet so far away,” he said. “It was taunting – you see it, look at it, and it’s right there, and you can’t do a frigging thing about it.”

It looked to Matt McKenzie like a fire with enormous potential, the kind of fire he might want to throw hundreds of fire engines at

Camp Creek Road may have defied fire crews, but it did lend the blaze its incongruously playful name: the Camp fire. Analyzing from the highway, McKenzie thought the wind was behaving unusually. Typically it blows south, toward his station. This time it was blowing west, as if trying to push the fire up the wall of the river valley, in the direction of the small community of Concow and, beyond it, Paradise. This was why he had been unable to catch its smell earlier.

It looked to him like a fire with enormous potential, the kind of fire he might want to throw hundreds of fire engines at. But there were only a fraction of that number in the county. He radioed the incident command team in Oroville, the county seat, and requested fifteen additional engines and four bulldozers. His hope was that they would catch the fire once it topped the slope it seemed to want to crest.

Escaping with dogs and a cat

The community of Concow centers on Concow Reservoir, which presents as an alpine lagoon fringed with tule reeds and piney mountains. The valley is a dimple in the gnarly uplands that separate Paradise and Jarbo Gap, and despite its relative proximity of only a couple miles to both, the circuitous roads mean that it takes 45 minutes to drive to the former and 25 minutes to the latter. People moved here to work the land and for the sun-speckled, dirt-road lifestyle. In the early 1970s, Concow’s population of loggers, homesteaders, and retirees was supplemented by hippie types looking for a more sustainable kind of existence, inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog, Wendell Berry, and the back to the land movement.

A former firefighter who lived in Concow named Scott Carlin had been doing his best to shut his mind off when he overheard a transmission from Jarbo Gap firefighters at the scene of the fire. Severe insomnia meant Carlin could go three or four days without sleeping, and that night, for the first time in years, he was forced to forgo his usual Ambien pill because he had been unable to fill his prescription. He lay oppressively awake on the living-room couch in a house west of the lake as his wife, Renee Carlin, a nurse at both an ER and a jail, and their two sons, Michael and Cody, dozed peacefully.

Carlin kept several of his old helmets on the wall, including the one he’d worn on a callout 20 years before, which almost became his last. He had been searching a burning mobile home for its occupant when a fireball exploded through it; he hit the floor, inches below the boiling maelstrom, and only got out because a colleague was groping for him through the doorway. Now he was a stay-at-home dad taking care of the property and of Cody, a sweet boy who had autism and needed ferrying to special classes and therapists. But it was hard for Carlin to shake the fire bug, which explained the radio scanners tuned to emergency frequencies on a desk just over his shoulder.

The message said the fire in Concow could be dangerous, but Carlin was cautious: was it really the case, or was the firefighter just green? When a second transmission confirmed the risk, Carlin roused his wife and sons, and they started throwing belongings in suitcases. Outside he tried to clear flammable brush away from the house with his little tractor, but it didn’t have much effect. Another radio message said that a home nearby had caught fire, and Carlin ran five minutes down a dirt footpath through the ponderosas, to the lakeside home of his wife’s parents, to tell them to get out. He jogged back to his own house, and then, for good measure, went back to his in-laws one more time to make sure they had left. Carlin joked that his mother-in-law, a retired teacher, did not operate on any schedule but her own. To his relief, they had gone.

On the radio, Carlin heard that the main road out of the valley was blocked. Having planned to escape this way, he was forced to change his course. Immediately he thought of the one place he knew would be free of fire. Carrying their cases – with their cat in a cage and their two dogs on leashes – Renee and the kids hurried through the smoky woods, past her parents’ house and toward the lakeshore. Cody had been afraid of dogs since a family pet had jumped on him and knocked him over when he was little. Renee told him he would just have to take one. Michael dashed to see if their aged neighbor, whom they only knew as Bruno, had left, and returned with Bruno’s arm around his shoulder, half carrying, half dragging him down the hill.

In no time at all they were engulfed. Flames were licking the edge of the lake, and the family edged out up to their knees in the muddy tule reeds. Bruno’s foot got stuck and he fell on his back. Fragile at the best of times, he seemed to give up. Just go, he told Carlin. Leave me alone. When Carlin went to pull him up, Bruno refused to give him his arm. “I’m not doing that,” Carlin said. “I’m not leaving you, I’m not gonna burn, so you’d better get your butt up.”

Unexpectedly, the reeds began to catch fire, and they had to edge deeper into the lake. Renee and her sons were quickly up to their necks or treading water. Cody had the cat in a cage on his shoulder, and the mewling animal was half-submerged. It was early November in the mountains, and the water was so painfully cold it took Renee’s breath away. She thought her heart might stop. Carlin, still in the reeds with Bruno, couldn’t see her in the smoke.

I’m not leaving you, I’m not gonna burn, so you’d better get your butt up Scott Carlin

Swim to the island, he shouted to them. By island he meant a peninsula sticking out from the opposite side, about 350ft away. Cody stayed behind, but she and Michael kicked out in the frigid water, and in the half-light, Renee could see the shore around her wreathed in smoke, and orange flashes of flame. The husky she was holding got loose and swam back to Scott. The border collie, panicking, tried to climb on top of her and threatened to push her under, and she screamed.

Yet the wind was so strong that despite propelling themselves in one direction they were pushed in another, down-shore of where they had launched out. It was a lucky mishap – Michael found two rowboats, each with a paddle inside, tied with a cable to a stump. He tried to wrench the cable apart, but it wouldn’t give, so he smashed the wooden post. Waterlogged and rotten, it splintered. Paddling themselves back to Carlin, they tried to coax Bruno aboard, but he flatly refused to get in. He simply couldn’t do it, he said. So with one hand Michael steadied a boat, and with the other he lifted Bruno onto the craft. Under the weight of four people and the dogs the boats were only two or three inches above the water, and Carlin told them to go without him. He would find them later.

They struck out, and this time they did end up on the peninsula. Soaking wet, they were freezing despite the occasional hot gust from across the lake, and they hid behind a rocky outcropping to try to keep out of the wind. Bruno’s ability to make sense of the situation was going, and he seemed not to remember what was happening. Renee’s legs were so cold that she couldn’t walk. Michael went to find help, hollering in case someone could hear him. In the distance there was a response to his cry.

‘The fire is now in Paradise’

On lots hidden by screens of trees across the valley, long-timers fired up their tractors or chainsaws and began clearing flammable brush from around their properties, to create a swathe of defensible space. Others jumped into their cars and poured out onto bad roads on which visibility was rapidly diminishing. They witnessed things that defied all logic and experience.

Looking across the road to her neighbor’s property, just a few hundred feet away, one woman, a British transplant named Joanna Curtin, saw a bulging whirlwind of flame and smoke that was sucking debris from the ground, setting it alight, and rocketing it into the sky. It was a fire tornado as wide as a pickup truck, and it was moving slowly but inexorably toward her.

“It sounded like a freight train going around. It sounded … it had this other sound too, more evil,” she said. “Oh God, I can’t even imagine what I could describe it as close to,” she added. “There was nothing earthly about it.” It was spinning and “throwing big pieces of wood on fire,” three to four feet in length. This meant one thing to Curtin: it’s time to go, doesn’t matter, leave everything and just go.

Firefighter Matt McKenzie was still in the Feather River canyon, patrolling the highway and trying to save what structures he could. And he’d been hearing radio traffic he couldn’t quite make sense of. There was trouble in Concow, that he knew, but it seemed, incomprehensibly, as though the fire had jumped even farther, at speeds he thought almost impossible.

At 7.42am, firefighters reported four small fires across the lake. Within two minutes a caller at Drayer Drive, on the eastern edge of Paradise, reported fire in the canyon his home overlooked.

Officials requested six tankers, a lead plane, and six helicopters. At 7.56am, dispatchers fielded a call about someone possibly trapped by the fire.

Two minutes later, Engine 81 in Paradise reported a spot fire at 1831 Apple View Way, a four-bedroom home near Paradise’s 97-old Noble Orchards.

['Nicola Davis'],2020-05-06,"Tummy rumbles? Otters juggle pebbles when hungry, study finds","Whether tossing pebbles between their paws or rolling stones on their chest and even into their mouth, otters are experts at rock juggling. Now researchers say the behaviour largely appears to be linked to a rumbling tummy.

Many species of otters are known to toss pebbles around, often while lying on their backs, in what appears to be an example of animals playing with inanimate objects. Mari-Lisa Allison, of the University of Exeter, said: “[I have seen] an otter at the fence putting a pebble through the mesh and then catching it underneath and rolling it round, round the fence”.

But quite why otters rock-juggle has been something of a conundrum. Now Allison and colleagues say their experiments back up the view that otters rock-juggle more when they are hungry.



“This seems to be the immediate driver of the behaviour. There, in that moment, they are rock juggling because they are hungry, they are anticipating food and they are getting excited,” said Allison. But, she noted, further research is needed. “The ultimate function is still quite a mystery,” she said.

Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Allison and colleagues told of examining the behaviour of otters at three wildlife parks and zoos in the UK. The team recorded about 12 hours of observations for each of 48 otters, six of which were smooth-coated otters and 42 of which were Asian small-clawed otters.

The team note the small-clawed otters forage for shellfish and crabs, while the smooth-coated feeds on fish. This difference suggested the latter might juggle rocks more frequently as they relied on dexterous movements to a greater degree. However the team found no such difference, although they said that could be due to the small number of smooth-coated otters observed, adding that the two species did show different juggling actions.

Further analysis revealed that among otters aged 11 years or below, juggling was more frequent the younger the animal, suggesting, the team said, that the movements could help with the development of motor skills.

However, the behaviour was also common among senior otters. Perhaps, the team said, the juggling had a role in preventing cognitive decline, although more work is needed to explore the idea.

The researchers also found otters juggled more frequently if they had not been fed for two or more hours. The team said that that could support previous suggestions that rock juggling was a type of “misdirected foraging” – in other words the hungry otters could be performing the type of dexterous movements they would use when extracting meat from shellfish but on rocks or pebbles instead.

Yet rock juggling does not seem to be a way by which the otters practise or improve their skills. The team presented the otters with minced meat inside medicine bottles, tennis balls and between two plastic bricks, but those experiments gave no sign that otters who juggled more frequently had greater success with solving puzzles.

But the team say the experiment had limitations; many of the older otters were arthritic, and the animals could have been put off by the unfamiliar nature of the task or might not have understood the puzzle.

Prof Hannah Dugdale, of the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the study. “The reason why otters juggle rocks has been difficult to study as there are many different variables that need to be considered at the same time, such as the age of individuals and how hungry they are,” she said, adding that the new study helped tease apart such factors.

But, she added, more work is needed to explore factors involved in rock juggling in wild otters, and its frequency, to fully understand the evolution of such behaviour.

Dr Elizabeth Chadwick, of Cardiff University, who is principal investigator of the Cardiff University Otter Project, also said questions remained. “Otters are absolutely captivating and rock juggling is one of their most intriguing behaviours,” she said. “The study helps explore and describe some of the differences in rock juggling between individuals, but is unable to provide the elusive answer as to why otters juggle.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/06/tummy-rumbles-otters-juggle-pebbles-probably-when-peckish
['Aniefiok Ekpoudom'],2020-05-05,Drillosophy: why UK rappers are teaching Plato in lockdown,"Before coronavirus put the UK into lockdown, writer and youth worker Ciaran Thapar and rapper turned ethnomusicologist Mehryar Golestani (stage name Reveal) had been running their “inclusive music education programme” Roadworks, using genres such as drill to engage young people in critical thinking and academic subjects. With the timeline for the country’s restart still unclear, Thapar and Reveal have now carved out an online space for their music-led youth work to continue in the video series Drillosophy.

In each of six episodes, they take a philosophical concept and break it down using metaphors thrown up in some of drill and UK rap’s most popular songs. The first episode, released last week, is titled Skengdo’s Cave, teaching the concept of Plato’s cave – a metaphor concerning mental freedom and the perception of reality – by dissecting the lyrics of south London drill duo Skengdo x AM. This is philosophy made accessible for “those not paying attention to their science teacher on Zoom”, says Thapar.

“I’d been using Plato’s cave among lots of different thought experiments in youth work for a few years,” he continues. “There’s a reason why these ideas stand the test of time; there’s something about Plato’s cave that just clicks straight away. Young people are like: I’m with you.”

Each episode will be released via Mixtape Madness, an independent music platform whose YouTube channel has become a hub for Britain’s emerging rap and drill artists. In the first episode, Thapar and Reveal, with input from Skengdo x AM, take a critical look at a genre that has been demonised and censored by authorities. They home in on a Skengdo lyric – “You don’t even know this guy / He wears a tracksuit so you think he’s trapping” – and then, via animations, compare it with the notions of distorted reality raised by Plato. “We’re not trying to speak to young people,” Reveal says. “We’re trying to empower them so they can speak for themselves.”

Drill has become the prevailing sound of UK youth culture, a fraught illustration of the lives of teenagers engulfed in violence. And while the genre has detractors who point to its sometimes violent or taunting lyrics, both Drillosophy presenters feel that to understand the experiences of young people, their modes of expression need to be embraced.

Thapar says drill is “something so all-pervading and powerful, talked about in politics and parliament and mainstream media. It travels into prisons and debating societies in university. Something about drill is connecting with a lot of people, on a human level. If you ignore that, if you don’t take that into account when talking to young people, you’re basically denying what they’re seeing around them, you’re not existing in the same world as they are.”

Other episodes in the series will intertwine Aristotle’s concept of catharsis with lyrics by Krept & Konan, Knucks, Pop Smoke and Ambush, and use English philosopher Jeremy Bentham as a roadmap for exploring why some rappers obscure their faces with balaclavas. Each episode, Reveal says, will be supported with online material to explain the concepts in detail, and for parents, carers and youth workers, provide important context on drill as a genre.

“By embracing drill,” Thapar continues, “by trying to tackle it – not singing and dancing about it like it’s got no problems – but by really trying to get to grips with it, I think engages with a certain level of the truth. As a youth worker, teacher, educator, if you’re trying to engage with them on that level it’s really powerful.”

The capacity for youth work in London has been shattered, Thapar says, by years of austerity and government cuts that have adversely affected the young and the vulnerable in the city. The situation has been further strained by the Covid-19 epidemic, with Thapar concerned for “vulnerable young people trapped in difficult circumstances for a long time”. To combat the latter, they have also been conducting mentoring sessions via Zoom (a move facilitated by Brixton-based organisation Spiral) in attempts to stay connected to the young people they work with.

The lockdown, Reveal says, has interrupted their usual setup of hosting workshops from classrooms. “But,” he adds, “one thing that never surprised me is how resilient young people are when adapting. They say when you’re young, your bones knit together quicker. So many young people are used to living with communication, and technology, that they’ve actually made that transition into this digital era that has been forced on us because of lockdown really successfully.”

Drill is a genre that has embraced the internet and technology from its inception. Its early videos leaked out of Chicago via YouTube, while in the UK, many artists have trumped a lack of traditional media support by thriving on pockets of social media, DIY YouTube channels and even Reddit forums. Beyond music, drill points to the attitudes, behaviours and platforms that steer the attention of the people youth workers are often working with, and so platforms such as Drillosophy meet them on their own turf.

“Technologically, the generational divide between teenagers and even ourselves is so huge and growing,” Thapar says, “let alone for a certain generation of decision-makers in politics and education, that I think we’ve got to use whatever we can to connect with young people. Drill, for me, represents music colliding with technological change in a way that we’ve never seen before and we’re just learning about. To ignore it, not only ignores truth but also ignores the technological world we live in.” With Roadworks and Drillosophy, he and Reveal are showing a new way out of the cave.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/05/drillosophy-why-uk-rappers-are-teaching-plato-in-lockdown

It could be a story from 50% of any of the romantic novels ever published (the other 50% of course being the plain woman picked by the extremely wealthy and mysterious man), but instead it’s the 12-episode (!) miniseries Normal People, adapted by Hulu and the BBC from the Sally Rooney novel of the same name. It’s a story as old as time. Which might be why it’s so deathly dull.

Normal People follows these two characters, Marianne and Connell, from high school to college, with a will-they-or-won’t-they story arc, with various forms of authorial interference to separate our lovebirds at various points in order to fill time. I thought I must be missing something. People love Sally Rooney. Her books have replaced those of figures like David Foster Wallace or Joan Didion as the books to be caught out with – “Oh, did this bestselling yet critically acclaimed novel fall out of my bag at the bar right next to the person I’m sexually attracted to? How clumsy of me!” – and adroitly signal to everyone around you your great taste and your with-it-ness in regards to cultural developments.

It’s a story as old as time. Which might be why it’s so deathly dull

But I was bored. I was bored watching actors with crows’ feet play 19-year-olds. I was bored watching these very typical representations of college students doing very normal things for freshmen, like throw tasteful dinner parties with all of the food made from scratch or dabble in S&M (represented in the show as a little bit of hair pulling, which, sure). Certain that nothing was ever going to happen, I started jotting down the action of each episode. “Glances exchanged” was the entirety of episode one. Episode two, “vaginal penetration”.

Perhaps what I was missing was the deeper meaning of the show. Maybe there was something there about Marxism. Rooney is a Marxist. Did you hear that hit Irish novelist Sally Rooney has Marxist politics? The author of Normal People and Conversations with Friends, she has Marxist leanings. I know Rooney is a Marxist because she brings it up in every single interview she has ever given.

We get it, Sally. You went to an elite university. Elite universities are where Marxist transmission happens these days, after all. Saying “I’m a Marxist” is a more understated way of saying: “I went to Trinity.”

The relationship between Marianne and Connell is explored mostly through power dynamics. She’s rich, so she wields more economic power; he’s a white male so he has more societal power. Marianne’s wealth gives her a natural introduction to the children of the elite on Trinity’s Dublin campus. “Do you see that?” I asked my cat, pointing at Marianne’s circle of friends on the screen. “That’s social capital.”

The characters say excruciating things, like “As a cis white male … ” and “It’s money, though. The substance that makes the world real.” Ah, there’s the Marxism I had been looking for. Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook, iconic tome of socialist feminism, is flashed. Someone says: “Men seem more interested in limiting women’s freedoms than exploring their own.” The TV show analyzes itself for you with these offhand comments by the characters, so you don’t have to do any of the hard work of thinking, and they don’t have to do any of the hard work of delving into the complexity of contemporary heterosexuality.

The desire to tell an old story in a new way only really works if you actually have something new to say. And bringing the power imbalances between the classes or between the genders to the surface of the story only counts as new if you assume that romance novelists throughout time, and their audiences, were completely ignorant about these dynamics. At least when these same stories appear in romance novels, chick lit, and romcoms, there are usually some good jokes, and the S&M is more stimulating than just lying there limp while your hands are bound.

For all its performed awareness about class relations, the show can’t maintain an interest in anyone who isn’t extremely attractive or extremely privileged. The only character who didn’t make the move from high school to university kills himself out of the hopelessness of it all, but of course that happens off screen and is only included as a catalyst for the reunion of our protagonists. And our hero, who struggles to make his way from vague, poorly defined hardship into the upper echelons of career-making education? He completes his hero’s journey into the creative class. He gets into that New York University MFA program.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/sally-rooney-normal-people-hulu-bbc-soap-opera
['Adrian Horton'],2020-05-05,Seth Meyers: 'This is what you get when you make a TV star president',"Seth Meyers

As several states began tentative, and risky, reopening measures, Donald Trump held a town hall at the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday night exclusively for Fox News – which “makes sense”, said Seth Meyers on Late Night, because Trump is “constantly either in a state of watching Fox or appearing on Fox or watching himself appearing on Fox. Eventually Fox is just going to turn into a 24/7 feed of Trump watching himself on Fox like an infinity mirror.”

The White House has basically become a Fox News offshoot of advisers for the president, Meyers continued, such as his new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who held her first press conference last week. The hiring of McEnany, a former Fox production assistant, epitomizes “the feedback loop of disinformation and propaganda that exists between the Trump White House and Fox News”, said Meyers. McEnany is known, for example, for defending Trump on cable news in February with “outlandish lies” such as “this president will always put America first, he will always protect American citizens, we will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here”.

Fox News also played a destructive role in what the Washington Post called Trump’s “lost month” of “desperation and dysfunction” as he ignored and then gave up on fighting coronavirus and instead focused, at the behest of aides and his favorite Fox News hosts, on prematurely opening up the economy. The Post reports that frequent Fox News guest and “Trump’s toothless vampire” Rudy Giuliani and host Laura Ingraham lobbied the president repeatedly, in White House meetings and on air, to embrace the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (“Remember when everyone cared about that for a second? The Tamagotchi of Covid cures,” said Meyers) as a coronavirus treatment (it is not proven and can have fatal side-effects). “Yeah, the TV president who played a TV businessman is listening to TV doctors,” Meyers said.

Colbert: Trump 'wants everything to go back to normal because he’s bored' Read more

Still, it’s confirmation that “a Fox host with no medical expertise [Ingraham] is directly advising the president on a deadly pandemic, while that same president hires pundits he sees on TV and fires or punishes actual experts and inspector generals who criticize him”, said Meyers. “This is what you get when you make a TV star president. Because when you’re on TV, no one ever tells you you’re wrong.”

McEnany, meanwhile, “completed the Fox News feedback loop” and transitioned seamlessly to “White House liar” on Friday by ending her briefing with a plug for Trump’s town hall on Fox, which she promised would have high TV ratings. “Oh, cool, so in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the White House press secretary is like a glorified TV Guide channel,” said Meyers, breaking out a faux-promo voice: “Looking for willful ignorance from a soulless sociopath? Check out the Fox News Town Hall at seven.”

Stephen Colbert

“No surprise, Trump is lying,” said Stephen Colbert of the president’s Fox News town hall on Sunday night. “He’s willfully endangering the lives of Americans” with his plan to reopen, as confirmed by an internal government memo, leaked to the New York Times, which revealed the Trump administration predicts a near doubling of the daily death toll by June.

“That means infection rates will skyrocket!” said Colbert. “Everybody’s going to have to go back inside and America’s going to have to find another animal exploitation true crime drama to watch.”

Trump’s town hall was billed as “America Together: Returning to Work”, “and Trump not only thought that the returning to work would happen soon, he thought this disaster might actually make things better”, said Colbert, pulling up a clip of Trump promising: “You’re going to get another job, but you’re going to get a better job. You’ll get a job where you make more money, frankly, and I think that’s going to happen.”

“Really? A better job, with more money? So it’s kinda good that you ignored the virus?” Colbert scoffed, whipping out his Trump impersonation: “I think this is gonna be even better because the pigs that just flew out of my butt told me they’re hiring, so that’s a positive.”

Trump was also asked about his combative stance with the press, which he defended as necessary because he’s “treated worse” than Lincoln was. “Really? You’re going to compare yourself to Abraham Lincoln?” said Colbert. “Well I’d like to point out that none of his supporters carried Confederate flags.”

Trevor Noah

And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed plans to reopen state economies, even as coronavirus case numbers increase across the country. “You would think an increase in cases would mean that maybe now is not the perfect time to open everything up,” said Noah, “but many states in America are saying, ‘hey man, this summer is not gonna enjoy itself.’” Florida beaches, for example, are teeming with people again.

The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) As America's coronavirus death toll races past Trump’s predictions, the only adjustment he’s made is to the goalposts. pic.twitter.com/gVUdQR54Q1

Still, “people on the beach might be the least of America’s worries,” said Noah, “because there are other groups doing much crazier things,” such as protesting against shutdown measures by storming statehouses with weapons. “Goddamn, only in America do protests start with storming the Capitol with assault rifles. I mean, did you try calling? Writing a letter? Usually the armed rebellion is the last step.”

Noah played a video in which two white female protesters badgered police officers and white men with rifles prowled the Michigan statehouse. “Now, I’m sure a lot of these people probably saw this video and said to themselves, ‘man, if black people were holding guns and shouting at the police, that protest would end badly,’” said Noah. “But guys, please, that’s not true – the protest wouldn’t have ended badly. There wouldn’t have been a protest, because all the black people would’ve been pulled over on the way there.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/05/seth-meyers-trump-what-you-get-when-you-make-tv-star-president

"['Francine Prose', 'Robert Reich']",2020-05-05,Will Americans ever forgive Trump for his heartless lack of compassion? | Francine Prose,"To exist at this moment is to navigate (or try to fend off) the flood of grief that threatens to submerge even our rare, buoyant moments. We mourn the death of friends and relatives, the absence of human contact and the everyday pleasures we once took for granted. We can’t stop thinking about the tens of thousands of families facing hunger, bankruptcy and homelessness even as they struggle to endure the loss of someone they dearly loved.

What’s striking, if not surprising, is that this deluge of sorrow has run dry at the door to the Oval Office.

Under Trump, America has gone a bit late Weimar. We know how that ended | Lloyd Green Read more

One’s heart goes out to the reporters who have sifted through the Donald Trump’s press briefings on the current pandemic – hour after hour of bombast, self-promotion, vitriol, lies and recklessly unscientific speculation – for any evidence of sympathy for those who are in pain. It’s hardly a shock to learn that our president’s expressions of care and compassion have occupied a total of less than five minutes, out of all that time.

After all, a man who mocked a disabled journalist and boasted about grabbing women wasn’t elected for the depths of his kindness and the purity of his moral conscience. And it seems unrealistically optimistic to have hoped that the extremity of this crisis should have inspired, in our leader, a deep and essential change of heart.

Arguably, few politicians seek (and are elected to) office out of an excess of compassion. Even those who respond to catastrophe in more appropriately “human” ways – George W Bush mourning the victims of 9/11, Obama tearing up at the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting – have been parochial in their sympathies; there was little ceremonial grieving for the innocent child-casualties of our bombing and drone strikes in the Middle East.

And yet we can’t help thinking how much less worried we would be if a humane, competent, well-informed adult was making the decisions that affect us all. Though we’ve learned that Franklin Delano Roosevelt turned away refugees from Hitler’s Europe, we can still imagine how comforting it was, for those who lived through the Great Depression, hearing his radio speeches: absorbing their message of reassurance and hope, his determination to comprehend and mitigate the sufferings of our nation.

Trump’s enraged, self-infatuated maunderings are the opposite of Roosevelt’s calm resolve. Yet ultimately our president’s failure of empathy is less disturbing than the ways in which it appears to resonate with his supporters. He and his allies have framed our response to the crisis in terms of partisan politics, to imply (incorrectly, as the polls suggest) that tough conservatives are eager to get back to work sooner than scaredy-cat, stay-at-home progressives.

The flag-waving, gun-toting, defiantly unmasked protesters storming the capitol buildings in Michigan and Wisconsin would seem to support that view. This, too, is a situation that could have been defused by a president who projected sympathy, who persuaded his listeners, as Roosevelt did, that the pain of those who have lost jobs and businesses is shared by us all. Instead we see Trump’s efforts to stoke rage and bitterness because he suspects that it might help solidify his base.

It may be that the deepening polarization in our country – the suspicion, grievance and rage that the president is spouting and encouraging – is less political than spiritual. These divides go deeper than how we vote; they express our core beliefs about our responsibility to those with whom we share this brief span on this damaged planet. As Slate editor Tom Scocca posted on Twitter: “Conservatives have by now been conditioned to believe that thinking about other people ‘s needs or interests in any way is tyranny by definition,” a sentiment echoed by Emily Raboteau in the Huffington Post: “I can’t debate someone into caring about what happens to our fellow human beings.”

It’s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants

This idea that empathy and altruism are expressions of weakness and naivety is nothing new; it’s the foundation of novelist Ayn Rand’s Objectivism, and it received a major boost during the Reagan-Bush years, when “trickle-down” economics did little to stem the growing problem of homelessness. But it’s never seemed so virulent as it does today, perhaps because it has never been so openly advocated – so blatantly demonstrated – by our president. It’s hard to think of anything more corrupt or corrupting than to boast about one’s success when (as I write this) more than 60,000 Americans have died of Covid-19. It’s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants.

What’s most frightening to me is that the lack of empathy – the selfishness, the resentment, the hope that others will suffer even more than we are suffering – is itself a kind of virus: contagious, dangerous, possibly even lethal. I’ve heard people say that the Wisconsin and Michigan protesters – shouting shoulder to shoulder, refusing to observe the simple rules of social distancing – won’t learn how profoundly Trump has betrayed them until they themselves contract the virus that they have been encouraged to downplay. I’ve even heard it said how unfair it is that our overweight, out-of-shape politicians – too vain to wear a mask, flouting scientific advice and the dictates of common sense – have proved immune to the disease that has felled so many decent, generous people.

But such statements echo the absence of compassion that Trump, by tweet and by example, is encouraging us to feel. It’s become another thing to resist. I don’t want to wish that anyone will learn that particular hard lesson, in that particularly hard way: not the governors opening their states for business before it’s safe, not the demonstrators on the state capitol steps, not our president. Despite my own anger, frustration and fear, I still can’t bring myself to claim suffering as a success.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/will-americans-forgive-trump
['Lloyd Green'],2020-05-04,"Under Trump, America has gone a bit late Weimar. We know how that ended | Lloyd Green","Welcome to the US in the age of coronavirus. Faces and fists pounded the windows of Ohio’s capitol like a zombie apocalypse. In Michigan, an armed crowd stormed the state house. Then, history repeated itself.

Taking a page from his Charlottesville playbook, Donald Trump called the protesters “good people” and urged Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, to “make a deal” over the shutdown. The president tweeted that Whitmer should “give a little, and put out the fire”. In other words, negotiate over the barrel of a gun. After all, his base was “angry”.

One state over, in Illinois, an anti-shutdown protester waived a poster aimed at the state’s Jewish governor, JB Pritzker: “Arbeit macht frei, JB.” The words that hung over the gates of Auschwitz.

A Trump administration insider conveyed that it was all a “bit” reminiscent of the “late” Weimar Republic. We know how that ended.

Society’s guardrails crashed, the volk demanded its pound of flesh and democracy made the frighteningly unimaginable possible. Hell became part of the here and now.

Election day is six months away. The US may experience 25% unemployment and economic collapse. We stand to witness “between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost”, according to Dr Deborah Birx. As for the protesters, Birx labelled their conduct “devastatingly worrisome”.

“Collective rage” looms large.

Life and death are on the line and the president and his minions appear reluctant to grasp the reality. Echoing his boss, Larry Kudlow ties himself into knots over earlier pronouncements that the scourge would be quickly gone. Marc Short, Mike Pence’s chief of staff, prematurely rejects projections of a death toll above 60,000. By Tuesday, the total will probably exceed 70,000.

How this plays out at the ballot box remains to be seen. But the early numbers should give Trump serious pause. It is unlikely that racial minorities, suburban mothers and college degree holders will take kindly to bully boys playing Trump surrogates.

A poll taken last month showed most Americans wary of returning to normal, with those living in cities and suburbs signaling particular reluctance. Indeed, Republicans disfavored such a move by nearly a two-to-one margin.

As for the presidential horserace, Trump is lagging Joe Biden in most national polls and in the swing states. Among college graduates, the former vice-president holds a near 20-point lead. Biden is ahead by double digits among women. Cultural resentments are two-way streets.

All this is a continuation of trends that appeared in the 2018 midterms. Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House and Democrats captured the female vote by nearly three-to-two, suburban women by more than 20 points, and a majority of white college graduates. Peloton moms made a difference.

More ominously for the president, swing states are drifting away: Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are lining up for Biden. In a break from four years ago, seniors are growing tired of Trump. Were the trend to hold, the ballgame would be over.

Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio also appear shaky. Biden could be sitting atop an electoral college landslide.

Excluding New York state, the number of coronavirus cases has moved upward and the average number of fatalities appears stuck in neutral. This is not the re-election campaign Trump envisioned in January. Not surprisingly, some of his most ardent supporters in the Senate are engaging in political social distancing.

"['Sean Monahan', 'Francine Prose', 'Robert Reich']",2020-05-04,What gay men can teach us about surviving the coronavirus | Sean Monahan,"To be gay is to get used to blood tests. If you are positive, you do them to monitor your HIV status. If you are negative and on PrEP, a daily medication that helps prevent HIV, you do them to ensure it’s working. If you are negative and not on PrEP, you do them to maintain your sanity. Every gay person has their own rhythm to testing, defined by their relationship to HIV, their sexual practices and their neuroses. No matter your status, waiting for test results is never easy. You count the minutes until you hear via text, in person, over the phone, in an app: your body is OK for now.

It won’t end until there is a cure. What we have right now is management. In the US, since around 1980 when the country’s first cases were identified, 700,000 people have died of Aids. In my lifetime, it went from an epidemic with no cure to one for which we have the tools to at least approximate herd immunity. People still die. There are no certainties. And the blood sacrifice we give at the clinic every few months reminds us of this.

We also remember not to blindly trust experts. Before writing this, I rewatched the Aids activism documentary How to Survive a Plague by David France, Woody Richman and Tyler Walk (full disclosure: Jordan Richman, my collaborator, is Woody Richman’s cousin). It’s inspiring because a group of activists rejected the incompetence and ignorance of politicians and played a decisive role in forcing them to find treatment. Act Up, the HIV/Aids activist group, was not always right, but neither were the experts. There was no time to wait for gay representation in the CDC, the FDA, Congress or White House. They used the tools of self-education and critical engagement to ensure they understood the issues and were able to call bullshit on their credentialed betters when necessary.

'There is no magic bullet': the town that turned the tide against HIV Read more

We spoke to David France about his recollections from that moment: “There were 15 dreadful years of unmitigated death – 15 years! – before treatments finally became available to make an HIV infection survivable. I spent those years in brutal terror, flat-out convinced I would be one of the dead. I have always thought that it was fear that saved my life. But 15 years after that, when I returned to the troves of archival videotape to make How to Survive a Plague, I was surprised to see how much joy there was among us. Some of the humor was dark, naturally, but all of it was affirming and forward-focused. Someone once said to me, ‘We had so much fun when everybody was dying,’ which sounds awful, but what she meant was not that we didn’t grieve or weep; she meant that we didn’t give up on the vision of a life we so fiercely defended. I think now that the power to imagine, put to the test by a plague, is the strongest tool we can deploy.”

The movie was released in 2012, and I went to see it at the IFC Center in New York. What struck me then was that this was still necessary. I remember returning home after college, and feeling like I had gone too long without STD testing. I made an appointment with my GP but got bumped to a physician’s assistant in his office. When I asked for screening, she replied incredulously: “Why do you want these tests? You think you have all the STDs?!” I remember my monotone and annoyed response: “I’m a gay man. I have multiple sexual partners. Men are oftentimes asymptomatic. I’m just here to get my periodic screening.” Sometimes you have to be the waiting room pamphlet you want to see in the world.

The only way out of our houses will be for everyone to get out of their comfort zones

Just because someone is a doctor doesn’t mean they’re not an idiot. I don’t mean that to demean healthcare workers, only to point out they are humans, too. So let’s keep our wits about us. Let’s evaluate people based on actions, not positions. Let’s not forget that sometimes we do know more than experts. If we don’t, they will never be able to refine and update their opinions. They will not see what they don’t see.

Seeing a newsflash that passengers from a quarantined cruise ship were refusing to be tested for the coronavirus, I reflexively cringed. It was so clear to me, someone who has nervously fidgeted in waiting rooms more times that I can count, that they were making a stupid choice. In gay parlance, to not “know your status” is to transform uncertainty into risk. Early detection and treatment is what would keep you healthy in the event you are seroconverted, and it is what keeps you secure in the knowledge you will not endanger the people you love. When I pointed that out to a straight friend, they were confused. “I dunno. I get it. Maybe better not to know.” They were dead-ass fucking wrong.

Similarly, when talk of immunity passports popped up in Germany, the UK, Brazil, I noticed a sharp division between the analogies straight and gay friends used. Straight friends saw segregating people based on immunity as something with dark potential. Was it fascist? Nazi even? Gay friends had a different response: this was Truvada. This was the thing that could make the invisible visible.

Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria Read more

With a critical mass of people positive and negative on Truvada, we can relax. Positive people more easily achieve undetectability – tests cannot find the HIV virus in their blood – and thus can’t pass the disease, while negative people essentially cannot contract it, even if a partner has not achieved undetectability. Immunity passports with a rapid testing regime might provide the possibility that we can organize our societies as if we had achieved herd immunity, allowing those who are unable to contract the coronavirus the possibility of relaxing and those who have not yet contracted it to take proactive measures to avoid the virus.

The politics of disclosure are important to this. Straight people simply aren’t used to constantly disclosing very private health information to new friends, and sometimes strangers. Of course, this can be avoided if you are celibate or in a long-term monogamous relationship, but honestly, who wants that? It’s not especially pleasant.

To be honest, though I’m negative, even I find it a bit awkward. Cum is a disease vector. Your responsibility to your community is to put ‘what’s your status’ into your saved phrases on Grindr.

As we exit this crisis, these are the lessons everyone will have to learn. It will be important, for those schooled in the days when a new acquaintance asking about your medical health would be unthinkable, not to take offense. The question comes from care. In all likelihood, since treatment is far away and vaccines possibly further, a testing plus passport regimen will allow us to slowly escape lockdown. The only way out of our houses will be for everyone to get out of their comfort zones.

['Paul Macinnes'],2020-05-05,Premier League club doctors express serious concern over football restart,"A group of club doctors has written to the Premier League expressing concern over potential risks to restarting the competition during the Covid-19 pandemic.



Before a crucial period for Project Restart, doctors have raised questions with the league over a number of issues to do with protocols designed to guarantee a safe return to training and, should government advice allow, full competition.

Football's future: 'Pubs and clubs won't bounce back for many months' Read more

At least one club doctor is known by the Guardian to have serious concerns about the protocols and whether football can be made safe in the near future. The questions were raised by at least four doctors and were sent via the Premier League doctors group to the league’s chief medical adviser, Mark Gillett. The league says the questions were requested as part of a continuing process of refining the protocols.



The measures were first discussed with the 20 top-flight clubs at an extraordinary meeting last Friday. They have not been approved by the clubs, however, and any final drafting is not expected to be complete until after the government makes recommendations on the possible easing of lockdown measures on Sunday.



Some of the doctors’ concerns are expected to be directly addressed in these recommendations, and a vote on the protocols is expected to be taken at a Premier League meeting on Monday.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/premier-league-club-doctors-express-serious-concern-over-football-restart
['Giles Richards'],2020-05-05,F1 risks angering Ferrari and Red Bull as it reveals long-term budget cap plans,"Formula One has presented its long-term roadmap for reducing the teams’ budget reduction, with a decision expected next week. It is understood that figures include a cap set for $145m in 2021, coming down to $140m in 2022 and then to $135m for 2023-25.

The targeted numbers are seen as acceptable to midfield teams such as McLaren but agreement is far from a given, with potential pushback at the scale of the proposed cuts possible from Ferrari and Red Bull.

F1 teams close to agreeing $145m budget cap for 2021 season Read more

On Monday F1’s sporting director Ross Brawn announced that new proposals had been sent to the teams. Last year a cap of $175m (£142m) was agreed for 2021. The financial impact of races being called off because of coronavirus has forced the sport to readdress the issue.

Brawn believes F1, the FIA and the teams were close to coming to an agreement for 2021 but noted the intent was for greater cuts without publicly offering any details. “The discussion really is how much further down we can drive it in the next few years,” he said. It is believed the $145m ceiling has broad support but the other figures under discussion are likely to prove more contentious.

McLaren’s chief executive Zak Brown has warned F1 could lose up to four of its 10 teams if the impact of coronavirus is not handled correctly and that F1 should use this as a chance to ensure the sport remains sustainable in future.

Ferrari, however, have opposed a drop below $145m, warning it was already a demanding request below which the team would be forced to consider how it employs its racing resources. Ferrari’s team principal Mattia Binotto also fears that too great a cap would risk devaluing the sport’s reputation for technical excellence as the pinnacle of motorsport. He is in favour of a two-tier cap to reflect the higher spending of the bigger teams on manufacturing parts, however this two-tier approach is not in the proposal, which may also prove a stumbling block.

[],2020-05-05,"No guarantee Tour de France will go ahead, says French sports minister","The French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu has delivered a stark warning to cycling, declaring that there is “no guarantee” that the Tour de France will go ahead this year.

The Tour has already been rescheduled from June to a 29 August start because of the Covid-19 crisis, but the minister could offer little assurance that the race would be given the green light. With crowd-drawing events banned in France until the end of August, special arrangements might have to be made for the start of the Tour in Nice, the sports ministry said last month.

“Many people are begging me to keep the Tour even behind closed doors,” Maracineanu told France Television. “I hope it will take place but I am not sure. We do not know what the epidemic will be like after lockdown.”

France’s lockdown, in place since 17 March, will be partially lifted on Monday, although the seasons of several sports championships, including football’s Ligue 1 and rugby’s Top 14, have been abandoned. Maracineanu added that the Tour and tennis’s rescheduled French Open, which will now start on 27 September, could be held behind closed doors should the ban be extended. The news came on the day cycling’s world governing body confirmed the Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a España will overlap in October as the UCI unveiled its revised calendar. The Giro is scheduled to take place from 3-25 October, with a shortened 18-stage Vuelta slated for 20 October to 8 November.

The Giro Rosa, among the highlights of the women’s calendar, will clash with the final week of the Tour de France as it is scheduled for 11-19 September, the week before the UCI’s Road World Championships in Aigle-Martigny, Switzerland.

['John Duerden'],2020-05-05,South Korea ready to kick off football season – with the world watching on,"In a pre-season friendly in the penultimate week of April in South Korea, two Incheon United players picked up water bottles, went to drink, stopped, laughed and then swapped. Name labels on bottles will be easy to adapt to but it remains to be seen if other measures will be widely accepted.

There are sure to be plenty watching to see what happens when the K-League starts on 8 May. South Korea has been a global inspiration in battling coronavirus and now has the chance to provide a similar example in the field of football.

Shorter games under consideration for football's return, says PFA chief Read more

In its 37-year history, the league has never had the kind of attention it will get on Friday evening as the 2020 season finally kicks-off. The year started with a frustrating search for a new domestic broadcasting deal but now media companies from around the world, desperate for live sport, have been knocking on the door of the league’s headquarters in Seoul. Ten international deals have been done – from China to Croatia – with others being negotiated.

“Live football is really rare these days,” Kwon Oh-gap, the president of the K-League, says. “It is a great opportunity to let the world know about Asia’s top league. We hope fans will forget about the virus when they watch the K-League.”

Taiwan and Turkmenistan may still be playing but the K-League, which has produced more Asia champions than any other, is a different level. It should have kicked off on 29 February, the champions Jeonbuk Motors, coached by José Mourinho’s former assistant José Morais, facing the cup holders Suwon Bluewings. That day, however, saw the country record 909 coronavirus cases, its highest number. Now with new local infections down to single digits since mid-April – and down to zero on 4 May – the situation is deemed to be safe enough.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The K League’s promotional video for the start of the season.

“In the process of preparing for the league to begin we consulted with medical experts and their common opinion was that we can consider starting the league when the number of confirmed patients was under 30 for at least two weeks,” Kwon says.

To get from February to May has been a slog with lots of hard work. All 1,100 staff and players were tested last week and within six hours, all came back negative, with the K-League picking up the tab.

There is no concern about football taking resources away from other sectors. Such is South Korea’s capacity it has been exporting tests around the world. Aggressive and extensive testing and tracing have helped it limit the number of deaths to 252 and on 15 April, 66% of a 44 million electorate voted in national elections without any apparent ill-effect.

There is no complacency, however. The 12-team league has already reduced the number of games this season from 38 to 27 and the campaign will be count as long as 22 fixtures are completed.

“The virus has calmed down but it hasn’t completely ended,” the president says. “If a case of the virus is confirmed in a team during the season, then their fixtures, as well as their opponents, will be suspended for at least two weeks.”

Other leagues have been in touch. “Various national football associations have asked questions about the K-League’s step-by-step response process and how to operate in the current situation. We are more than happy to cooperate and share the manual.”

The manual helps map out the process but there will be differences on matchday. There are no fans but that should change sooner rather than later and, like at the Asian Champions League games in February, fans will be wearing masks and have their temperatures taken before entering the stadium.

Post-match interviews will take place on the pitch, not in a cramped stadium corridor, with reporters staying two metres away. There will be no shaking of hands and coaches are exploring ways to get their instructions across while wearing masks.

“Excessive spitting or blowing of the nose is prohibited and players should refrain from close conversations,” says the K-League communication officer, Woo Cheoung-sik. “During the game, players who habitually spit or talk closely will be warned.” Sanctions for those who spit and talk repeatedly and/or deliberately will be decided by the league.

There has been some pushback on this. The Incheon captain, Kim Do-hyeok, said not spitting is fine but not talking is impossible. Officials believe a middle ground will be found with everyone just happy to get back on the pitch.

“Our goal this year is to complete the league,” Woo says. Anything else is a bonus but whatever happens the world will be watching.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/south-korea-ready-to-kick-off-football-season-with-world-watching
['Andrew Lawrence'],2020-05-05,Why is it always the white NFL players who get a second chance?,"Rare is the NFL draft that provokes second guessing about a kicker. But this year’s edition was no ordinary draft (see: 19, Covid.) And Justin Rohrwasser is no ordinary kicker.

When the New England Patriots selected Rohrwasser in the fifth round to replace the legendary Stephen Gostkowski, it was a shock, especially as the 23-year-old hadn’t been considered an exceptional talent in college. ESPN host Trey Wingo was even forced to admit on live TV that the Worldwide Leader in Sports had no highlights of Rohrwasser’s career.

And even if there had been any B-roll of a weather-beaten Rohrwasser blasting three-pointers against Rice or Western Kentucky, none of those images could eclipse the more striking one on his left forearm – of the Roman numeral III ringed in 13 stars. To the untrained eye, the tattoo would seem little more than a marker of youth. To the keener observer, it is the unmistakable brand of the Three Percenters – a far-right paramilitary group that champions gun ownership and resists federal involvement in local matters. Formed in reaction to the 2008 election of Barack Obama, some members of the group took up arms and served as sentries for white supremacist protesters at the 2017 domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, that resulted in 28 injuries and one death.

If athletes like Nick Bosa support Trump they should at least be honest Read more

Rohrwasser, who can be clearly seen exercising his right to bare arms in official team photos, has played the naïf. He told reporters that draft night was the first time he’d heard about the significance of his tattoo, which he says he mistook for a US military symbol. He pledged to ink over it, then promised to laser it off entirely, all the while apologizing to friends and family whom he’d put in the “compromising position” of having to defend the indefensible.

Those attempts at damage control might have sailed through the uprights if he hadn’t followed and “liked” so much far-right social media content. Or recommended books from Jordan Peterson and other radical traditionalists. Or previously bragged about tattooing himself with a sewing needle. Or completely ignored the much bigger tattoo just under his Three Percenters dog whistle that reads “Liberty or Death”. That’s the cry that was last heard by the anti-government protesters who’d sooner drive down to the local statehouse with their guns and exhaust in a policeman’s face than let something as trifling as global pandemic deny them the right to a haircut and a mani-pedi. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer said the demonstrations at her state capitol – which, among other things, featured armed militia men waving Dixie flags and nooses – brought back memories of “some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country.”

So profound is the remorse in Rohrwasser’s heart that he apparently spent a portion of what should have been the happiest day of his life crying in his car, according to an anecdote his high-school coach shared with the Boston Globe. And, shoot, you had to feel for him. Pro football makes it so easy to summon the sympathy. When white players like Rohrwasser get whistled for their supremacist taunts, somehow, they’re the ones who are forgiven. It was true when Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins used a racial epithet to refer to black and Hispanic teammates. (He blamed it on the alcohol.) It was true when Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught on tape threatening to jump a security barrier at a Kenny Chesney concert and “fight every nigger here.” (He blamed it on the alcohol, too.) And it was true when Richie Incognito bullied his teammate Jonathan Martin – “a half-nigger piece of shit,” in Incognito’s estimation – out of the NFL. While Incognito resumed a career to which he’s felt very much entitled, Martin has spent the five years wrestling with his mental health. Collins, Cooper and Incognito all carried on their careers in the NFL, as will Rohrwasser. You could argue that everyone deserves a second chance. Protest about the racism inherent in the US though, and you may well find your football career is over. Or, for that matter, your basketball career.

In a league where nearly two-thirds of the guys in pads are black, it stands to reason that a white player’s ethnic and cultural biases should be judged as harshly as their 40-yard dash times – you know, just to stave off any potential “locker room distractions.” But instead of a sharp examination of an actual weakness that only a white player can weaponize, we get the same ol’ soft focus on black poverty porn. We get an ESPN box on Clemson wideout Tee Higgins that ends with a bullet point about his mom fighting drug addiction for 16 years. We get another bullet in the box on Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault Jr about his mother surviving West Nile virus. We get yet another bullet in the box on Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs about his father dying of heart failure. It’s enough to make you wonder where the bullet point about all the racist and homophobic posts Nick Bosa had liked (and subsequently deleted) before he was taken second overall in last year’s draft.

For a shop run by Jimmy Pitaro – the politically averse ESPN president who has promised, on more than a few occasions, to deliver content that sticks to sports – these digressions are quite far afield indeed. What’s more, every year his network seems to come into the draft with an endless supply of these backstories. (Maybe someday one of the 12,000 draft analysts in ESPN’s employ will find the courage to weigh in.) It’s almost as if there is a stubborn social construct in America that makes it virtually impossible for black athletes to escape the traumatic beats in their humble beginnings.

If ever there was a team owner in the league who might appreciate the irony at work here, it’s the Patriots’ Robert Kraft. Here, after all, is a man who not only works with Meek Mill and Jay-Z on criminal justice reform, but also gives liberally to Blue Lives causes, supports the troops and first responders and counts our law-and-order president among his closest friends. How does a guy like Kraft wind up drafting a guy like Rohrwasser? Easy. His team had a need, and his coach saw something. With a bit of laser removal and a few clutch kicks, likely, Rohrwasser will soon reduce the breathless stories about his rightward leanings to a “West Nile”-sized poverty porn bullet. The most people will remember is that he was called out for his extremist affiliations, he wept. As long as Rohrwasser plays the victim, he can never lose.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/justin-rohrwasser-richie-incognito-nfl-football

Mixed messages emanate from Jerry Seinfeld’s new Netflix special, which introduces a daredevil leaping from a helicopter to get to his gig, then substitutes him for a world-weary sexagenarian, disengaging from life with a dismissive wave of his hand. So which is true? Neither, I should think – as that contradiction cheerfully reminds us, we don’t turn to Seinfeld for personal intimacies. He is Mr Generic, the American everyman who exists on stage to channel our observations of, and mild frustrations with, the business of being alive.

Aged 65, he still does so sublimely – particularly in the first half of this new hour, filmed in New York and featuring material performed in the UK last summer. A wonderful opening sends up the rigmarole of coming out to do a comedy show, just another “hyped-up not necessary special event … put together so we could kill some time”. Why do any of us bother? None of us want to be here, Seinfeld tells us, as if blowing the gaff on some illicit truth. “Nobody wants to be anywhere … Nobody likes anything.”

Seinfeld and chill: why the classic sitcom can help beat lockdown anxiety Read more

Via a detour into Pop-Tarts and pretentious cuisine, subjects with all the cutting-edge of a soup spoon, our host segues (“What else is annoying in the world besides everything?”) into a disquisition on technology, reaping big laughs from our iPhone dependency and the poorly remembered origins of text messaging. Again, familiar standup terrain – but Jerry excavates the novel angle, and brings it to zesty life with exemplary delivery and (witness his dumbshow of cartoon exhaustion as his phone battery dies) unshowy physical comedy.

There’s a lull after this, not redeemed when Seinfeld “changes gears” into more personal material – which turns out to be old-fashioned ’er-indoors shtick about married life. The “women do this, men do that” generalities are a bit off-the-peg. But there are some choice riffs, as his wife complains about his incorrect tone (“I thought it was a marriage; apparently it’s a musical”), and as Jerry frets that his babies are also his replacements. (“Their first words are ‘mam’, ‘dada’ and ‘bye bye’.”) Helicopter sky-dive apart, there’s nothing daring about Seinfeld – but if 23 Hours to Kill is safe, it’s also, usually, sparkling.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/05/jerry-seinfeld-23-hours-to-kill-review-sublime-standup-from-mr-generic
['Sam Jordison'],2020-05-05,Defoe's Plague Year was written in 1722 but speaks clearly to our time,"Reading A Journal of the Plague Year, the first uneasy jolts of recognition come on page one. The narrator tells us that he and his neighbours heard that the plague was “return’d again in Holland” at the beginning of September 1664. We are told the government were given warnings but kept their private counsel; that the people began either to forget this foreign problem, or to regard it “as a thing we were very little concern’d in”.

As I write this in May 2020, the parallels with our initial response to a problem far off in China are so striking that it feels almost ridiculous to point them out. And so it goes: turn the page, and we get the first report of the “weekly Bills” showing the increase in deaths in each parish in London, which are obsessively noted by our narrator throughout his account. The tallies provide their own grim commentary on the terror of the sickness, just like the deaths tolls we’ve been receiving every day for weeks.

Then we find out that these tallies may not be reliable. The authorities’ figures are always low: “The next Bill was from the 23rd of May to the 30th, when the Number of The Plague was 17: But the Burials in St Giles’s were 53, a frightful Number! Of whom they set down but 9 of the Plague.” Later it was discovered at least 20 more “were really dead of the plague”, but had been “set down of the Spotted-Feaver or other Distempers, besides others concealed.” In 1665 as in 2020, the figures for excess deaths give a more useful insight than the number of deaths actually attributed to the infection.

The parallels continue. The narrator notes that the measures necessary to contain the outbreak were taken too late:

I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them, and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sank in that disaster, which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided, and which, if posterity think fit, they may take a caution and warning from.

That’s hard to read, here in posterity. Elsewhere, there are haunting passages about the emptiness of familiar streets, “for when the people came into the streets from the country by Shoreditch and Bishopsgate, or by Old Street and Smithfield, they would see the out-streets empty and the houses and shops shut, and the few people that were stirring there walk in the middle of the streets.”

We can all now recognise his wonder that London should be so quiet. I also felt a queasy recognition of my own habit of walking down the middle of roads to avoid people.

Defoe is also fascinating on self-isolation. We haven’t yet got to the stage of painting red crosses on the doors of infected houses, or posting guards outside so that the people starving and dying inside can’t escape. Nor have we imposed the 40-day isolation period that gives “quarantine” its name. But any reader today will recognise the fear and pity with which the narrator talks about the people who have the disease and may transmit it, especially those who do so unwittingly:

By the well I mean such as had received the contagion, and had it really upon them, and in their blood, yet did not show the consequences of it in their countenances: nay, even were not sensible of it themselves, as many were not for several days. These breathed death in every place, and upon everybody who came near them; nay, their very clothes retained the infection, their hands would infect the things they touched.

Breathed death! Unsurprisingly, everyone in Defoe’s London is jumpy. And it’s not just people they have to fear. There’s little mention of the rats whose fleas transmitted the plague – but there are familiar worries about household pets. Horrifyingly, Defoe notes, “a prodigious number of those creatures were destroyed. I think they talked of 40,000 dogs, and five times as many cats.”

Defoe also tells us of the rich fleeing to the country and taking death with them, noting how the poor are far more exposed to the disease. He describes “quacks and mountebanks” peddling false cures and the poor people who “even poisoned themselves beforehand for fear of the poison of the infection”.

The correspondences are so clear that it feels strange to remember that Defoe was describing events 355 years ago – and that A Journal of the Plague Year, published in 1722, is not even a firsthand account. But in that, at least, there’s hope. It may often feel like Defoe is writing about our present, but this is a book set in the past tense. “A dreadful Plague in London was,” he writes at the end. And this too, shall pass.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/05/defoe-a-journal-of-the-plague-year-1722-our-time
['Scott Tobias'],2020-05-05,Did Gladiator really deserve the best picture Oscar?,"When Gladiator was released in early May 2000, there wasn’t much of an inkling that it would go on to win the Oscar for best picture, for the obvious reason that it was positioned as the first of the summer blockbusters, promoted less for its historical gravitas than its bloody combat in a digitally enhanced Colosseum. In retrospect, it shouldn’t have been a surprise that two and a half hours of speeches, montages and decadent pageantry would fit into a broadcast that’s an hour longer and slightly less violent. But the best picture designation has been an odd stain on Gladiator’s reputation over the years: a film that might have been remembered as a satisfying revenge spectacle instead looks like a second-rate prestige picture.

The Virgin Suicides at 20: Sofia Coppola's debut continues to haunt Read more

Twenty years later, perhaps it’s time to take Gladiator back to its original framing, not as the spoiler to Steven Soderbergh’s unlikely coronation as a Hollywood director – his Erin Brockovich and Traffic were best picture nominees, and he won best director for the latter – but as a classed-up underdog sports movie, like a middle-period Rocky sequel in sandals and tunics. The palace intrigue that follows the death of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius may give the film a certain amount of sophistication, as do the performances by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who all make excellent and multi-layered contributions. Yet this is essentially about an undersized warrior gutting his way to a title bout – all else seems like window-dressing by comparison.

The competitive arc of Gladiator is Rocky III leading into Rocky IV. It’s about our hero first belting his way through a colorful array of opponents – barrel-chested goons, armor-plated archers on chariots, man-eating tigers emerging from the arena floor – before finally battling the villain on hostile turf and turning the home crowd to his favor, against the will of a brutal authoritarian government. Again, this is not a mark against the film, because it’s mostly rousing on these terms, boosted by a Roman succession plot that plays one man’s epic revenge quest to the highest of stakes. But the argument that the film is any deeper than the red-meat savagery it delivers doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. It’s a terrific summer movie, and one of the new century’s least deserving best picture winners.

For director Ridley Scott, it started a run of enervating historical action-dramas that included Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood and Exodus: Gods and Kings, none of which had the same propulsive kick. The benefit of Crowe’s Oscar-winning lead performance – and a script (by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson) that was geared around it – is that he makes it impossible to get lost in the hectic atmosphere Scott conjures here from hundreds of extras, digital landscapes and assorted period bric-a-brac. There’s a lot to draw the eye away from the central action in Scott’s films – Orlando Bloom, for example, doesn’t have the presence to draw focus in Kingdom of Heaven – but Crowe’s General Maximus Decimus Meridius has a simple and well-defined mission, and the actor plays it as righteous as a sword plunged straight to the hilt.

Contrasting the scorched earth of Germania, where Maximus leads his men in one final push against the barbarians (“At my signal, unleash hell!”), with the golden fields of home, where his wife and son await after his years away, Gladiator begins with a patriot’s humble request. In exchange for his service to the empire, he wants a little time off – those fields ain’t gonna harvest themselves, you know? But he gets caught up in circumstances beyond his control: the dying Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) wants him as a placeholder to boost the senate and lead Rome toward democratic rule. But that means passing over his vile, sadistic failson, Commodus (Phoenix), who craves the unfettered power of an emperor and unnaturally shortens his father’s life to get it. Commodus condemns Maximus to a quiet execution in the forest, orders his family murdered and sets about engineering the dissolution of the senate and a comprehensive quashing of dissent.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Connie Nielsen and Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator. Photograph: Allstar/Dreamworks

When Maximus is picked up by slavers in Zucchabar, a Roman city that would now be in Algeria, and he’s forced to battle to the death alongside other gladiators – first in local events and later in the Colosseum, where he becomes a sensation. The fun irony is that the feckless Commodus has brought the gladiators to Rome as a bread-and-circuses initiative to distract the great unwashed while he seizes total authority over the empire. Now with Maximus besting all comers in front of lusty boobirds turned super-fans, chanting his name like the Soviets rooting for Rocky, Commodus’s hold on the throne is becoming more tenuous.

Phoenix is a wonderfully hissable villain as Commodus, a legacy brat who understands his own absence of nobility and honor as liberating qualities – like any good tyrant, he sees a clean conscience as a terrible obstacle to his ambition. But most of the behind-the-scenes complexity comes courtesy of Nielsen as Lucilla, Commodus’s sister and Maximus’s former lover, who acts with political expediency in order to survive, but asserts herself firmly in the shadows. Lucilla is a glimpse into what Gladiator might have been if its priorities were directed more toward the machinations of government rather than the machinations of separating a man’s limbs or head from the rest of his body.

The action sequences in Gladiator dance right on the edge of coherence, which may have something to do with the difficulty of matching live-action with digital backdrops, but mostly falls in line with popular action directors like Michael Bay or Scott’s brother, Tony, who were favoring movement and viscera over the nuts-and-bolts of clear blocking. When Maximus is battling an undefeated chest-thumping hulk twice his size named Tigris and actual tigers appear in support, it becomes obvious that we’re being treated to a bread-and-circuses gorefest along with the Roman commoners. And once you come to that realization, Gladiator no longer seems like a bid for respectability. It had respectability imposed on it.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/05/gladitor-ridley-scott-russell-crowe-best-picture-oscar
['Alexis Petridis'],2020-05-05,Dave Greenfield: putting beauty at the rotten heart of the Stranglers,"Music writer Pete Paphides’ recent memoir, Broken Greek, contains a vivid description of its seven-year-old author encountering the Stranglers for the first time, during a 1977 Top of the Pops appearance. “They landed in the living room while I was totally unsupervised,” he writes, “and scared the shit [out] of me. By now I would have seen images of punk rockers … but they looked like circus entertainers compared to [the Stranglers]. They looked too old to be punk. They looked like the sort of people you pass in the street and your mother puts her arm round you, stares at the pavement and doubles her walking speed … The point at which it all got too much was when the camera cut to Dave Greenfield – who has died from Covid-19 aged 71 – jabbing his keyboard while looking straight ahead with what seemed, beyond doubt, to be the eyes of a murderer, an effect somehow compounded by the army-surplus boiler suit he had decided to wear. Just like that, my list of phobias had got a little longer: worms, biting into mushrooms, insects, the fibreglass King Kong which stood next to a ring road in Birmingham city centre and, now, Dave Greenfield from the Stranglers.”

It’s funny writing, but it’s also very incisive about the Stranglers: in real life Greenfield was, by all accounts, the band’s most approachable and charming member, but otherwise Paphides has it spot-on. The Stranglers complained relentlessly about not being accepted by the punk cognoscenti, but what did they expect? They didn’t look like punks, particularly Greenfield, who defiantly sported that least punk of facial accoutrements, a moustache. They were old, at least by the standards of the day, old enough to have the kind of musical pasts it was wise to keep your mouth shut about in the scorched-earth environment created by the Sex Pistols: Hugh Cornwell had played bass in a band with Richard Thompson, later of Fairport Convention; Greenfield had been in a prog rock band called Rusty Butler.

Worse, Greenfield declined to keep his mouth shut about his past, at least metaphorically speaking. He played keyboards, sometimes several at once: nothing compared to the banks of equipment behind which Rick Wakeman plied his trade, but far more than most punk bands would countenance. Sometimes his playing recalled the reedy organ sounds found on 60s garage rock singles by ? and the Mysterians or the Standells, which was just about acceptable under punk rules. More often, he played exactly like someone who’d been in a prog rock band, decorating songs with complex arpeggios, which absolutely wasn’t. Moreover, his playing was the Stranglers’ signature sound: with the greatest of respect to Hugh Cornwell’s gruff vocals, or Jean-Jacques Burnel’s fluid bass playing, when you think of the Stranglers’ most famous songs – from Peaches and No More Heroes to Waltzinblack and Golden Brown – you think first of Greenfield’s keyboards.

His contributions were the solitary aspect of the Stranglers’ music you might describe as beautiful. Everything else about them was as relentlessly, wilfully nasty as their song titles suggested: Ugly, Tits, Bring on the Nubiles, Nice N’ Sleazy, Peasant in the Big Shitty, Down in the Sewer and – oh God – I Feel Like a Wog. If it makes for profoundly uncomfortable listening now – “problematic” barely begins to cover the lyrical content – their music had a remarkable power, a sense of unceasing, misanthropic hostility. But they sounded less like a punk band than a band that predated punk, that sprang out of that weird, liminal period immediately prior to 1976, where the bleakness of mid-70s Britain had seeped into rock’s fringes – the tougher end of the pub-rock scene, the more thuggish bits of late-period glam – but not yet become codified into series of musical diktats. Which is precisely what they were: they had formed in 1974 as the Guildford Stranglers, Greenfield joining a year later.

It meant that the Stranglers were always regarded with suspicion by the music press – a state of affairs not helped much by the band’s propensity for violence – but it also meant that the Stranglers weren’t constrained by punk. Grimly powerful as their debut album Rattus Norvegicus and its follow-up No More Heroes were, there’s a compelling argument that the band really hit their stride on 1978’s Black and White, by which time Greenfield’s keyboard playing had become more expansive and experimental. It’s never really hailed as such, but Black and White has a claim to be the first post-punk album: the taut dance rhythms, jagged guitars and synthesiser tones of Enough Time and Threatened, the attempt to meld dub reggae with Captain Beefheart on In the Shadows, the claustrophobic racket of Curfew and the stabbing, angular, curiously homoerotic Death and Night and Blood (Yukio) were all adventurous explorations beyond stripped-down rock’n’roll.

On the best of their subsequent singles, Greenfield seemed ever-more integral: their extraordinary cover of Walk On By – on which the Stranglers somehow contrived to turn Dionne Warwick’s exquisite original into six minutes of brooding, barely contained aggression – was dominated by his organ playing; his rolling piano underpinned Don’t Bring Harry, an authentically chilling song about heroin; on 1979’s fantastic Duchess, his arpeggios are no longer a striking embellishment, but appeared to have consumed the band’s sound entirely. And then there was Golden Brown, which seemed astonishing at the time – a Stranglers single that got played on Radio 2! – and seems more astonishing still in retrospect: a harpsichord-led song about heroin in a strange time signature that went to No 2 in the charts. The lyrics were frontman Hugh Cornwell’s, but it was Greenfield’s show: he wrote the music with drummer Jet Black, his performance is the song’s heart.

They were adaptable enough to keep having hits long after most of their peers had split up or faded away, but a certain sense of diminishing returns eventually set in: by the time of 1990’s 10, they sounded perilously close to being Another Rock Band, not an accusation even their loudest detractors could have pinned on the authors of No More Heroes or the deranged concept album The Gospel According to the Meninblack.

Yet the Stranglers proved to be weirdly unstoppable – neither the departure of Cornwell nor the retirement of Jet Black, aged 78, really dented their live following. That might have been the flipside of the Stranglers’ lack of critical acclaim or latterday reappraisal, and the kind of refusal to play by the era’s rules that Greenfield seemed to embody: never fashionable to start off with, they weren’t subject to fashion’s vagaries, instead building a huge, devoted cult following born out of being outsiders.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/05/dave-greenfield-putting-beauty-at-the-rotten-heart-of-the-stranglers

I've heard it's terrible': match the Cats cast member to their quote,"Judi Dench has broken her silence on Tom Hooper’s musical, calling her Cats coat ‘battered, mangy’, ‘a great big orange bruiser’ and more colourful descriptions. So what have her colleagues said about the film?

'I haven’t seen it. I've heard it's terrible': match the Cats cast member to their quote

Dame Judi Dench’s interview in the new issue of Vogue is a lovely thing, touching on everything from her early career in the theatre to her thoughts on the outbreak. But that isn’t why you’ll read it. No, you’ll read it to witness Dame Judi Dench struggle to describe her Cats costume. She has several attempts at it. She looked like “a battered, mangy old cat,” she said. Like “a great big orange bruiser”. Her cloak alone looked like “five foxes fucking on my back”. You sense that Judi Dench isn’t necessarily the biggest fan of Cats.

Dench’s comments are a welcome inclusion to my favourite form of 2020 entertainment; the stars of Cats reacting to Cats. Because you can tell a lot about a person by how they respond to their participation in what is destined to be an eternal punchline. Do they stand by the director? Do they remain professional and rise above the baffled din? Or do they give up all pretence of dignity and, like Dench, slag it off just as hard as everyone else?

For fun, I have unearthed some quotes by the stars of Cats, varying from outright horror to brave professionalism. Your job is to guess who is responsible for each of them, and your prize is getting to remember that Cats exists.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/05/i-was-overwhelmed-with-joy-match-the-cast-member-to-their-cats-quote
['Kate Hutchinson'],2020-05-05,Kelly Lee Owens: ‘I still have to fight to not be seen as ‘just the singer’’,"Kelly Lee Owens is showing me her crumpled bed, pixelated on the screen. It is five weeks into quarantine and this has quickly become the norm: an interview with an artist in their close quarters; ambivalent levels of grooming. Neither of us is wearing makeup, and neither of us care. “You know what I read?” begins the electronic musician, incredulously. “This is bullshit. There’s a [Daily Mail] headline saying that women’s breasts will be sagging because they’re not going to be wearing bras during this lockdown. So what?! Leave me to my saggy breasts.”

And so it is over FaceTime, Owens in a black turtleneck top, two gold heart-shaped pendants dangling from her lobes, and occasionally a flash of Walthamstow, north-east London, through her window. The earrings belonged to Owens’s “nana”, to whom she was incredibly close and who passed away last year. “She was there two minutes after I was born and I was with her when she died,” she says, her tone darkening. “I was holding her, talking her through her death.

“I’ll show you, actually, I’ve got this shrine,” she says, heading over to her dresser and pointing to an assortment of candles, a playing card in the middle. “She signed it with her name, Jeanette, and that’s one of the tracks on my new album. I think it’s important to have a place to connect.”

That album is called Inner Song and its release has been pushed back from May until August. It is an obvious blow for Owens after the momentum of her self-titled debut in 2017, which made many a publication’s end-of-year list, with its deliriously buoyant techno-pop, as dreamy as it was pumping. She is trying to remain upbeat but says the decision was to stand in “solidarity” with record shops, which have had to temporarily close.

When Owens moved from Wales to London in her 20s, she worked at Pure Groove records, where she met many DJs who encouraged her to pursue music. She had always been Team Indie, with a stint in the shoegaze band the History of Apple Pie, but the sessions for her former co-worker Daniel Avery’s Drone Logic album, on which she provided her hypnagogic vocals, turned her on to techno. Watching her friend in the studio with her future engineer, Ghost Culture, she says, “it seemed like they were crafting magic”.

Owens decided to craft magic of her own, ditched her band and started performing as a one-woman Berghain with synths and guitar. But as her popularity grew, her personal life started going south and she wasn’t enjoying her breakthrough success. “A relationship that I was in was quite destructive,” she says. “Me being me, I just powered through.” But then, “there were times when I was in bed, and I couldn’t move,” she admits. “I was trying to juggle lots of things to keep different people happy, and neglecting myself.” It’s a familiar story for women, putting others’ happiness ahead of our own. “We’re actually taught to do that, I think,” Owen agrees.

And so she went through a period of having to, as one song title goes, “re-wild” herself. She read Clarissa Pinkola Estés’s Women Who Run With the Wolves, spent time in nature, did free writing and undertook a “body release trauma session”, which involved the rather intense experience of having someone stare into your eyes for five minutes. The week after that, she says, “I wrote most of the lyrics for the album – I could be honest with myself and I could feel the losses, all the things I’d been holding in.”

Owens understands the role of healing more than most: in her late teens, while others would be waiting tables, she worked as an auxiliary nurse in a cancer ward, “holding people’s hand as they die”. The job gave her a unique insight into death. “Hearing is supposedly the last thing that goes,” she says, and so, when her grandmother died, “everyone was around her, holding her hands, telling her they loved her. That’s one of the ways to die well.

“This sounds really weird,” she adds, “but I feel like later on in life I might become a death doula. We need to have more conversations about death, and I’m not afraid of that.”

It is obviously devastating to consider that, right now, people aren’t able to see their loved ones as they pass. “People are dying alone and it’s a very serious thing,” Owens nods, although she has been thinking about alternative comforts. “I know it’s a pandemic, but maybe there could be their favourite scent in the room, or maybe there could be music playing,” she suggests. “It’s obviously not easy to do any of this, and the NHS is struggling, but I can’t help but think of little ways that would help ease [their pain].”

She recently dedicated a playlist of calming tracks to care workers, some of whom she is still in touch with from her hospital days, and who she is understandably concerned about. “The PPE [shortage] is absolutely huge,” says Owens. “I know a lot of doctors who are refusing to work, and I fully support them in that. The government is putting it as a war, so we have ‘heroes’, and actually all they’re doing is what they’d normally do with wars, which is to sacrifice people.”

Death crops up a little on Inner Song, including the destruction of the planet on the climate-crisis banger Melt!. But the album is also concerned with finding your way back to yourself. In a way, the making of it has been preparation for a scenario like the current moment: many of her lyrics suggest finding strength in solitude, atop kosmische soundscapes and 2-step beats. Owens’s voice is front and centre this time, instead of acting as another instrument, and we hear a lone male voice, too, on “psychedelic lullaby” Corner of My Sky: that of John Cale, whom she had asked to read a poem. It’s still rare to hear a lone male vocal on a piece of electronic music produced by a woman. “That’s quite bizarre, isn’t it,” ponders Owens, “but I think you’re right.”

It was her “insistence”, she laughs, that resulted in her and friend Jon Hopkins making the ambient-trance song Luminous Spaces in January. Originally a remix of his track Luminous Beings, Owens did the arrangement and added vocals, and it became something new entirely, even otherworldly. So it was disappointing for Owens to see the part she played diminished.

“Unfortunately, all the comments on YouTube are like: ‘Jon’s a wizard, he’s amazing,’” she says. “His production is amazing, but I took that track and made it what it is. And he’ll tell you that.

“It’s boring,” she continues, “but I still have to fight my corner, because if I don’t I’m passed off as ‘just the singer’. Why are we presuming that if a woman’s voice is on something, it’s the only thing she’s contributed? We have to keep undoing those preconceptions.”

You can hear traces of Hopkins’s style of thwacking rave on her new song, Night, but that might not be the only influence he’s had. In a previous interview, Owens told me that the late, great DJ Andrew Weatherall had come into Pure Groove once and asked her: “Kelly, do you take drugs? Because I’ve heard your track Lucid,” one of her more mind-altering productions. Has that changed? Hopkins’s last record was, after all, partly inspired by trips on DMT. She ripples with laughter. “Let’s just say with the track, Corner of My Sky, that might be what microdosing mushrooms sounds like. Maybe!”

Owens is keen to find positives everywhere she possibly can. She recently tweeted the definition of the word “apocalypse”, to mean “revelation – an unveiling or unfolding of things not previously known”. Does she think, then, that there could be tiny positives to the pandemic at all? “I do, and that’s just because I’m in a very privileged position to say it,” she says. “I’m hyper-aware of how you can come across when you say: ‘This is good for the planet.’ But it also is important to point out the duality of consciousness, and raise awareness of what can happen when we are apathetic.”

The track on her album, Wake-Up, points to this idea, too. “One of the things [it questions],” she says, “is never pausing to take it in, always avoiding your sense of dread.” A world-changing event like this “forces us to ask important questions. Globally, we are connecting now. That’s what’s important.”

['Ammar Kalia'],2020-05-05,Hollywood's Jeremy Pope: 'Is there room for another black man like me?',"‘Can all of us be in the same room at the same time?,” Jeremy Pope asks over the phone from his home in Los Angeles. It is over a month into lockdown, but he isn’t questioning the rules of physical distancing. Rather, the 27-year-old is pondering the unspoken rules of Hollywood prejudice – who gets to share a platform with whom, and whether there’s only space for one minority figure at any given time.

Pope’s latest project – his first major TV role – is in Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series Hollywood, a revisionist story set in 1940s Golden Age tinseltown, where he plays Archie, a gay, black screenwriter who is trying to break into the industry. It is a story he could relate to.

“What’s brilliant about our series is that you have a powerful man like Ryan Murphy who is capable of making any type of TV he wants, and then he makes a show like this – showing the world what it could have been,” Pope says. “And I am what it can be, he’s given me my debut TV opportunity. I often feel very similar to Archie and I wonder: is there room for another black man like me?”

Hollywood is a lascivious, lustful take on a much-mythologised era, centred on a group of fledgling stars: Pope’s Archie, whose retelling of Peg Entwistle’s suicide is picked up by director Raymond (Darren Criss), and actors Jack (David Corenswet) and Camille (Laura Harrier). Criss and Corenswet are established actors of the Murphy stable, having starred in his previous productions such as Glee, The Politician and The Assassination of Gianni Versace, yet for Pope, Hollywood – the show and the town – was an unfamiliar experience.

“I was coming to the end of what I called my marathon when I was cast,” he says. “I was doing eight shows a week on Broadway of Ain’t Too Proud and that was right on the back of Choir Boy, so when I got the call to audition, I was exhausted.” Both shows were tales of the black American experience, albeit in very different ways; Choir Boy was a journey of self-discovery set in an elite prep school and penned by Moonlight’s Tarell Alvin McCraney, while Ain’t Too Proud was a musical based on the career of the Motown group the Temptations. Both performances earned Pope Tony nominations, making him only the sixth person in its 73-year history to be up for two awards in one season.

When he was offered the role of Archie, it was for an “untitled Ryan Murphy project” and he had no idea what it would entail. “When I met Ryan, we just had a great open dialogue about the show and it was a very collaborative process,” he says. “I soon became really excited about this story and representing a powerful black gay writer in the 1940s, but I needed to be reassured that there were directors and writers that represented me on the show, too.”

That support namely came in the form of longtime Murphy collaborator and Hollywood co-writer and co-director Janet Mock. “Janet was my ride or die,” he says. “We got to really dig into these characters and talk about the racial acrobatics these people had to go through. We know how hard it must have been to just be a coloured man in the 40s but then to also be an out gay man? It’s like you already walk into a room with two strikes.”

Archie’s scenes in the show are often highly demanding and emotional, tearfully confronting studio executives who seek to erase his experience or demanding recognition in the face of prejudice and privilege, yet Pope found it disconcertingly easy to tap into his narrative. “Doing eight shows a week in theatre means I can deliver that intensity once, or eight times or even 12 – I can bring that discipline,” he says, “but even more than that, with these scenes I would just think about people like Hattie McDaniel, who was the first woman of colour to win an Academy award. But she wasn’t allowed in the ceremony and when she did win, the Academy had written a speech for her. So, I would feel the pain that she had to go through to be a beacon of light for people like me. It’s so heartbreaking and it made me ask just how high am I allowed to dream?”

For Pope, that battle to dream big continues. “It’s easy for me to go back to a moment in my life where I felt that maybe I wasn’t good enough or I wasn’t allowed to stand in my truth when I was playing Archie,” he says, referencing his teenage years in Orlando, Florida and trying to become an actor and singer. “Hollywood is a period piece but we can still identify with the struggles of the characters today – we’re still fighting for equal opportunities for women, for people of colour, for the LGBTQ community. I just hope that this show continues to inspire our generation of artists to keep fighting to establish that there is room for all of us.”

In the meantime, Pope is spending his lockdown with a well-deserved break from the rigours of filming, “making music, writing and learning how to bake my grandmother’s pound cake”. “In these past couple of weeks I’ve just been able to think of all the moments we’ve had thus far and how great they have been,” he says – taking in the entirety of his community into his third person “we”. “I know that when I get back to work, we will be on that mission just as aggressively as we were before.”

"['Alexandra Villarreal', 'Francine Prose', 'Robert Reich']",2020-05-05,Scared and sick amid Covid-19: US nursing home workers afraid to blow the whistle,"Staff at a New Jersey nursing home say some have contracted the virus and describe insufficient protection as they interact with residents, endangering everyone involved

Workers at a New Jersey nursing home ravaged by coronavirus have described a culture of silence, gross inaction from management and a desperate lack of protective equipment that has put them and their families in harm’s way and made it largely impossible to protect their patients from the outbreak.

AristaCare at Cedar Oaks, a long term 230-bed care facility, had seen 106 confirmed coronavirus cases and 29 deaths reported as of last week. It’s one of 508 long term care facilities with outbreaks in New Jersey alone. According to a list collected by the Washington Post, around 1,350 nursing homes nationwide have reported Covid-19 cases, though the newspaper admits this is an undercount.

Covid-19 has killed thousands in nursing homes across the country. Yet healthcare professionals who were already overworked have agreed to longer hours and have continually put themselves in danger to care for their patients.

A pattern has emerged across America: workers on the frontlines – primarily people of color and immigrants – have been abandoned with insufficient PPE. Nurses and nursing assistants, meanwhile, are terrified that if they blow the whistle, they’ll lose their jobs.

AristaCare staff largely spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity for fear of consequences at work. Some have contracted Covid-19, and all described insufficient, inadequate or irregular provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) as they interact directly with residents, endangering everyone involved.

Amid the pandemic, AristaCare did limit visitation and mandated screenings at the door for anyone entering the facility. But inside, the situation devolved quickly, staff say. One worker watched as roommates infected one another and died from the virus, and alleged that management acted too late. She said one resident only moved floors recently, despite showing signs of Covid-19 weeks before.

“They’re trying to clean it up now for it to look good,” she said. “But we already lost a lot of residents.”

The worker has somehow managed to stay healthy, even as her colleagues fall ill. She gets home, goes immediately to her basement, takes a shower, puts her clothes in the sink and uses Lysol on her coat and shoes.

“I’m very concerned,” she said.

Sherry-Ann Ramkaran, a certified nursing assistant, and another employee, both of whom were sick, said that early into the public health crisis they had been directed not to wear masks around the patients in their care. One of them said she was told it would make the residents feel bad.

“Bottom line is, I know I contracted the virus there, at work,” the woman said.

Ramkaran had been performing mandatory temperature checks and asking questions of everyone coming in and out of the home before she started running a fever in late March and later tested positive for Covid-19.

“I was the first case in my house, first one to get sick,” Ramkaran said. “And I passed it along to my family, which is not a good gift to give.”

AristaCare at Cedar Oaks did not return multiple requests for comment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released guidance for nursing homes and long-term care facilities recommending that available face masks be reserved for healthcare personnel, who should also be reminded not to come in if they’re sick and educated about their facility’s new policies.

Workers at AristaCare, however, described flimsy, cheap masks they were originally provided as PPE. They said some people had come into work sick, and one nurse had even been given a hard time for reporting her symptoms, her colleague said.

Ever-changing guidance from the CDC was posted around the facility, but staff were never privy to any real knowledge, beyond basic reviews of hand-washing practices, about protocols during the pandemic, some said.

In the absence of leadership, workers chronicled a piecemeal game of telephone, where information about how to handle the outbreak came mostly from news outlets and each other.

“They didn’t prepare us for any of this. They didn’t come and say, ‘oh, you know, so-and-so is going on, and we all need to be prepared and be extra careful,’” said Ramkaran. “They didn’t give us any kind of notice.”

As some workers call out tired, sick or afraid, others now have to shoulder an even heavier load in an industry already infamous for chronic understaffing. At AristaCare at Cedar Oaks, nurses have sometimes watched over 32 or even 64 patients – not necessarily a dramatic increase compared to before the pandemic, but a distribution one nurse nevertheless called “impossible”. A different employee said she had clocked in for nonstop, back-to-back shifts over a two-week period.

“I hope that there is a real awareness that we owe them more than to name them as heroes, and that we have an obligation to see them as workers without whose work, whose labor, we wouldn’t be able to survive this pandemic,” said Milly Silva, an executive vice president at 1199SEIU, the country’s largest healthcare union.

Ramkaran thought her Covid symptoms were simply exhaustion; at one point, she worked around 90 hours in just over a week.

New Jersey nursing homes are primarily staffed by immigrant women whose situation Silva said reflects a larger conversation around immigrant labor in the US. The caregivers are deemed essential, she said, but they’re simultaneously not seen as the “full human being” that they are.

Ramkaran has been ill since 24 March, but AristaCare has only paid her 37 hours of sick leave, despite her being a 10-year veteran with the company. She feels certain she contracted the disease while at work, a possibility her human resources contact initially dismissed.

“When they told me I didn’t get the virus at the job, I was really disappointed and hurt,” Ramkaran said. Because she had taken on extra shifts, the only places she spent time before showing Covid symptoms were at AristaCare and home, she said.

As Ramkaran’s family members cared for her, they too got sick, and both her asthmatic daughter and husband with respiratory and heart problems have tested positive for Covid-19. Her husband required two hospital visits as his oxygen levels dropped.

['Julia Kollewe'],2020-05-05,WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann sues SoftBank over $3bn deal,"Adam Neumann, WeWork’s co-founder and former chief executive, has filed a lawsuit against Japan’s SoftBank, accusing it of abusing its power in order to terminate an agreement to buy $3bn (£2.4bn) of stock from him and other early investors in the office-sharing company.

SoftBank, which is run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son who is also WeWork’s biggest investor, announced in early April that it was walking away from the share tender rescue deal hammered out last October to save WeWork from collapse.

It said at the time it had “no choice” but to scrap the rescue deal because WeWork had failed to meet several conditions. It also cited concerns about “multiple, new, and significant pending criminal and civil investigations”.

Neumann would have been the biggest beneficiary of the payouts to minority shareholders, as he was lined up to sell $970m worth of shares.

The lawsuit, filed in a Delaware court, said Softbank and its Vision Fund had let down Neumann and WeWork staff.

“Mr Neumann put his trust in [SoftBank and the Vision Fund] to be stewards of WeWork, which he — and thousands of others — had worked so hard to build,” the lawsuit said.

Neumann had upheld his end of the bargain, according to the filing, while WeWork’s Japanese investors had not.

“The abuses committed by [SoftBank] and SBVF [SoftBank Vision Fund] are so brazen that they have prompted legal action by a special committee of WeWork’s board,” the lawsuit added.

﻿Responding to Neumann’s lawsuit, Rob Townsend, the SoftBank chief legal officer, said: “SoftBank will vigorously defend itself against these meritless claims.”

He added: “Under the terms of our agreement, which Adam Neumann signed, SoftBank had no obligation to complete the tender offer in which Mr Neumann – the biggest beneficiary – sought to sell nearly $1bn in stock.”

Neumann resigned as chief executive last September from the firm he co-founded in 2010, after scrapping plans for a stock market flotation. Investors balked at the company’s sky-high valuation. It had been valued at $47bn, despite losing $3bn in the past three years, but that valuation was slashed to $8bn by the time of the bailout in October.

Tim Bray, a top engineer and vice-president at Amazon, announced on Monday he is resigning “in dismay” over the company’s firing of employee activists who criticized working conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Bray’s resignation comes as Amazon faces increased scrutiny and employee activism surrounding its internal response to coronavirus. Amazon workers on Friday participated in a nationwide sick-out to protest against poor working conditions and inadequate safety protections, claiming the company has failed to provide enough face masks for workers, did not implement regular temperature checks it promised at warehouses, and has refused to give workers paid sick leave.

In a blogpost explaining his resignation, Bray called the firings of organizers at the company “chickenshit”, and said they were “designed to create a climate of fear”. In resigning, Bray has become the highest-ranking corporate employee at Amazon to publicly speak out about worker conditions.

“Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” Bray, who had worked at the company for nearly six years, said.

The Guardian previously published Bray’s blogpost in full under Creative Commons licensing, but took it down at his request.

Bray cited the experiences of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa – two user experience designers at Amazon who were fired in April after publicly denouncing the treatment of warehouse workers.

Bray also cited activism among warehouse workers themselves, including actions from Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Bashir Mohammed and Chris Smalls – all of whom were fired after organizing.

A leaked memo obtained by Vice News showed how an Amazon executive denigrated Smalls, who had helped organize an action at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse, labeling him as “not smart or articulate” in a meeting with Jeff Bezos.

Amazon did not respond to a request for comment, but previously cited violations of internal policies as reasons for dismissing these employees.

Amazon made more than $33m per hour in the first three months of the year, according to earnings reports last week, boosted by consumers on lockdown ordering supplies to be delivered to home. The chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, who was already the richest man in the world, has personally seen his fortune swell by $13bn this month to $145bn.

“At the end of the day, the big problem isn’t the specifics of Covid-19 response,” Bray said. “It’s that Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only that’s not just Amazon, it’s how 21st-century capitalism is done.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/04/amazon-tim-bray-resigns-working-conditions-coronavirus

As New York saw temperatures climb past the 70s this weekend, a more relaxed approach to social distancing was out in force. New Yorkers, starved for fresh air and sunlight, took advantage of the weather to visit parks and go to the beach. In response, over 1,000 NYPD officers were deployed across New York’s five borough to enforce social distancing mandates, with police officers reminding people to maintain 6ft of distance and to wear face masks.

But some have complained of a tale of two very different cities when it comes to how those guidelines have been enforced. In particular, outrage has sparked over juxtaposed images that show officers handing out masks to white sunbathers, while another video shows an officer punching a person of color and sitting on him following a dispute about social distancing.

The video footage recorded in Manhattan’s East Village shows an officer approaching a man and hitting him several times in the face before pushing him to the ground and kneeling on his neck.

The NYPD has confirmed that the officer, now identified as Francisco Garcia, has since been stripped of his badge and his gun and the incident is under internal review.

Daquan Owens, a bystander who uploaded the video of the arrest to social media, told New York Daily News that the police reaction was uncalled for.

“The guy that just got slammed to the floor and punched, he was just standing there saying, ‘They didn’t do nothing,’ and actually they didn’t do nothing,” Owens told the Daily News.

“Nothing was going on, nothing provoked the cop. He just got up, pulled his Taser out … The cop, I guess he was frustrated and took his frustration out on the guy,” said Owens.

In a statement, the NYPD confirmed that the incident concerned social distancing protocol to begin with, but had escalated as marijuana was observed at the scene and that one person “took a fighting stance against officer [Garcia]”.

“A group was observed standing on the corner … in violation of social distancing orders. Officers instructed the group disperse and while most complies [sic], some refused. As officers approached, they observed a bag of alleged marijuana in plain view … A third individual was ordered by an officer to disperse and this male took a fighting stance against the officer and was also taken into custody,” an official NYPD spokesperson said.

Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea both acknowledged the incident in a joint press briefing Sunday. “It started out as a social distancing enforcement … I am aware of the video that’s out there,” said Shea. Mayor de Blasio said he was “really disturbed” by the footage in a tweet on Sunday evening.

['David Smith'],2020-05-04,Senate rejects Joe Biden's request to search for records on Tara Reade,"Senate secretary said legal counsel advised that ‘the secretary has no discretion to disclose any such information’

The US Senate has rejected a request from Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, to search for and release any records of a 1993 complaint against him from an aide who has accused him of sexual assault.

The former vice-president gave his first TV interview on the matter on Friday, flatly denying former aide Tara Reade’s allegation that when he was a senator from Delaware he pushed her against a wall and assaulted her.

Gretchen Whitmer backs Joe Biden on alleged assault: 'not every claim is equal' Read more

Biden also wrote to Julie Adams, the secretary of the Senate, requesting that she locate and make public any paper trail relating to a complaint Reade says she made to the Senate personnel office.

But on Monday the secretary said the Senate legal counsel had reviewed relevant laws and, based on strict confidentiality requirements, advised that “the secretary has no discretion to disclose any such information as requested in Vice-President Biden’s letter of 1 May”.

The Biden campaign responded with three questions: can the Senate disclose whether the records exist; is there anyone to whom the records could be lawfully disclosed; and can the Senate release any procedures used by the office that would have overseen a sexual harassment complaint in the 1990s.

The decision left more questions than answers and was seized on by Republicans. Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, wrote in an email: “Joe Biden’s attempt to offer faux transparency ground to a screeching halt this morning.”

Guest accused Biden of sending the media on “a wild goose chase” to look for records in the National Archives, which said it does not hold them, and then to the Senate.

The existence or otherwise of records at the Senate, National Archives and University of Delaware has become a vital piece of the jigsaw in the allegation against Biden, who said on Friday that he was not aware of any complaint on file.

Biden told MSNBC: “This is an open book. There’s nothing for me to hide.”

Reade has said she filed a complaint at the time of the alleged incident and was subsequently fired. But she said last week that the complaint did not explicitly accuse Biden of sexual assault.

“I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,” she told the Associated Press. “I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.”

Reade subsequently tweeted that the AP report was “false”. She also said she had been threatened.

Reade was among eight women who alleged last year that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with unwanted touching or displays of affection. He apologised, then appeared to make light of the matter.

After Biden effectively secured the Democratic nomination to face Donald Trump in November, Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in his Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993, alleged Biden pinned her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office, reached under her skirt and pushed his fingers inside her.

Reade, 56, said she was reluctant to share details of the assault during initial conversations with reporters more than a year ago because she was still coming to terms with the incident and feared a backlash. Two of her associates said last week she had conversations with them that corroborated aspects of her allegation.

Numerous Democratic leaders and figures in the #MeToo movement have shown solidarity with Biden. Republicans have accused them of hypocrisy, arguing they have been zealous in believing women who have accused Trump and other conservatives of assault.

The president has faced multiple accusations of assault and harassment, all of which he denies.

Maureen Dowd, a columnist at the New York Times, observed: “Democrats always set standards that come back and bite them. They have created a cage of their own making.”

But Trump himself, trailing Biden in numerous polls, has been uncharacteristically hesitant to weigh in. In an interview with the conservative radio host Dan Bongino, he said if the accusations were false, Biden should deny them.

“Just go out and fight it, it’s one of those things,” Trump advised. “I’ve been a total victim of this nonsense, false accusations.”

Biden has, however, drawn criticism from the left of the Democratic party. Nina Turner, who was national co-campaign chair for Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the Democratic race and endorsed Biden, told Reuters: “It can’t appear that [Reade] is being ignored just because it’s an inconvenient truth for certain people in the Democratic party.”

Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act as a senator but came under fire for his handling of Anita Hill’s 1991 Senate testimony against now supreme court justice Clarence Thomas.

He said last Friday on MSNBC: “Believing women means taking the woman’s claim seriously when she steps forward, and then vet it, look into it. That’s true in this case as well …

“But in the end, the truth is what matters, and in this case, the truth is the claims are false.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/04/joe-biden-tara-reade-senate-records-reject-request

In a statement on Monday, the operator said eight cruise ships would resume operations from 1 August, sailing from Galveston, Texas, and Miami and Port Canaveral in Florida, once a no-sail order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had expired.

Tasmania coronavirus outbreak traced to two Ruby Princess passengers Read more

The CDC has issued repeated warnings that cruise travel has spread the coronavirus outbreak around the world and on Friday, the US Congress announced an investigation of Carnival Cruise Line’s parent company – Carnival Corporation – over why it did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff.

In response to the announcement, the CDC said it had not discussed timelines for resuming cruise travel with any operators, adding “we do not have enough information to say when it will be safe for cruise ships to resume sailing”.

Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival’s ships, which saw major outbreaks on the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess.

Carnival Cruise Line said it was “committed to supporting all public health efforts to manage the Covid-19 situation” in the statement to customers and travel agents announcing a limited resumption of its North America operations.

“We are taking a measured approach, focusing our return to service on a select number of homeports where we have more significant operations that are easily accessible by car for the majority of our guests,” it continued.

The CDC no-sail order was first issued on 14 March amid rising concerns about how “cruise ship travel may continue to introduce, transmit, or spread Covid-19”. The order was extended for 100 days on 15 April until 24 July, prohibiting travel until Covid-19 is no longer a public health emergency or the CDC modifies the order based on specific public health advice.

Alongside the announcement to resume operations, Carnival Cruise Line said it had cancelled all of its trips in July and extended the “pause” operations in all other North American and Australian markets until the end of August.

“We will use this additional time to continue to engage experts, government officials and stakeholders on additional protocols and procedures to protect the health and safety of our guests, crew and the communities we serve,” the statement continued.

In a statement, the CDC said it “is closely monitoring the situation on cruise ships while we review the cruise lines’ plans to prevent, detect, contain and respond to Covid-19 during the no-sail period.

“CDC will continue to work with cruise lines to ensure all necessary public health procedures are in place when cruise lines do begin regular sailing.

The largest trade association for the cruise industry has called the CDC’s requirements for disembarkation “impractical”.

The standoff comes amid a deteriorating situation on many ships around the world and a rising death toll of crew members.

More than 100,000 crew workers are still trapped on cruise ships globally, at least 50 of which have Covid-19 infections. This number includes around 80,000 crew members on 120 ships that are in international waters near the US waiting to disembark.

Revealed: 100,000 crew never made it off cruise ships amid coronavirus crisis Read more

Some major cruise operators have blamed the CDC for not allowing trapped crew to leave ships. But the health agency said it “stand[s] ready to approve these requests with same-day turnaround in most cases”, and has urged staff to contact cruise liners about disembarkation.

The CDC confirmed it had detected hundreds of Covid-19 and Covid-like illness cases in crew since March in US waters, resulting in the deaths of at least six crew.

A doctor on the Norwegian Gem, operated by Norwegian Cruise Line, died aboard the ship from a “respiratory illness” on Thursday.

The Miami Herald obtained internal Norwegian Cruise Line documents confirming the doctor’s death and assuring crew on the ship that he had died in his sleep from “cardio-respiratory arrest”, but had “no symptoms of Covid-19”. The Herald reported that the cruise company did not respond to their inquiries. Norwegian Cruise Line also did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.

A third crew member on the Oasis of the Seas, currently off the coast of Florida, died in hospital on Sunday. The death of Carlos Baluran, who worked the night shift in the vessel’s incinerator, comes after the death of waiter Dexter Joyosa and Indonesian waiter Iputu Sugiartha in the last two weeks on the same ship.

In a statement, the CDC told the Guardian that it is “allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in US waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members”.

It said: “These requirements include ensuring safe transportation by non-commercial means, providing cloth face coverings to crew members or ensuring they have their own, and providing instructions to crew members to stay home for 14 days after they reach their destination.

“CDC shared this information with all cruise lines in US waters on 23 April 2020 to help crew members return home safely. Since then, CDC has received and approved signed attestations to disembark crew from 15 ships.

“Some cruise lines have been unwilling to comply with the requirements to safely disembark their crew. Reasons include unwillingness to sign the attestation because of the legal consequences, and not wanting to pay for noncommercial transportation.”

But Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest trade association for the cruise industry, said some of the CDC’s requirements were “impractical”.

“To require employers to guarantee that every employee outside the workplace will fulfil all of the CDC’s stated requirements, including not having any interaction with the public whatsoever, with criminal sanctions at stake, is both unprecedented and impractical,” it said in a statement.

On Monday, the first wrongful death lawsuit for a crew member was filed on behalf of the family of an Indonesian housekeeper on the Symphony of the Seas, operated by Royal Caribbean. The suit alleges that the company failed to protect staff by not implementing social distancing measures on board by allowing crew to hold parties and eat together.

The company replied in a statement that it was working with authorities around the world to repatriate thousands of staff. It confirmed it had agreed to CDC restrictions to repatriate staff, and said it declined to comment on pending litigation.

Asked what support it was providing crew in the wake of the three deaths on the Oasis of the Seas, it said: “We have our Employee Assistance Program that crew can call 24 hours a day and is confidential.”

Carnival Cruise Line, which announced plans to restart operations at the beginning of August, said it would use 18 ships to repatriate more than 10,000 healthy crew members to Asia, Africa, Europe, India and Latin America.

“The safety and wellbeing of our team members continues to be a top priority. Given the pause in our operations, we are committed to getting our crew members safely home to their families. We sincerely thank them for their hard work, patience and understanding during this process,” said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line.

Alongside more than 100,000 crew, CLIA confirmed that 50 passengers remain at sea on five cruise ships – Celebrity Eclipse, Costa Deliziosa, Queen Mary 2, Caribbean Princess and Coral Princess – as of 29 April. So far, CLIA has recorded 2,789 confirmed cases of Covid-19 onboard 33 CLIA oceangoing cruise ships, but could not provide data relating to crew.

“It’s a shame that it comes down to dollars and cents,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer in Miami, who has represented both the cruise companies and, most recently, cruise crew members.

Q&A What are flags of convenience? Show Hide A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.

For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes. For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers' Federation. Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account. The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition. Karen McVeigh, senior reporter

He said the situation facing crews now is rooted in the cruise industry’s avoidance of US governance. Even though the largest cruise lines are headquartered in the US and serve largely American clientele, they avoid US labour law and other regulation by registering outside the US and sailing their ships under foreign flags.

“These crew members are like refugees now. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place,” he said. “The cruise lines think they can do anything they want with these folks and not treat them like human beings and not get them back to their homes.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/cruise-companies-accused-of-refusing-to-let-stranded-crew-disembark-due-to-cost-coronavirus

The ghost ship that washed on to Ireland’s coast earlier this year remains something of a mystery: its owner has not been found, which could potentially leave the Irish state with a bill of millions for its removal.

Authorities are still trying to trace those who own and are responsible for the MV Alta, a 77-metre cargo vessel that ran aground near Ballycotton, a fishing village in County Cork overlooking the Celtic Sea, in February.

It had traversed the Atlantic for more than a year without crew or passengers and skirted the Americas, Africa and Europe before wedging itself on to rocks during Storm Dennis.

“We’re still trying to establish ownership and that process may take up to a year,” a spokesperson for Ireland’s revenue commissioners, who act as “receiver of wreck”, a statutory function, said on Tuesday.

An individual purporting to represent the owner contacted the agency in February but that ownership claim remains unproven. “We’re still investigating,” said the spokesman.

If no owner is found, the Irish state will face a choice: spend millions of euros removing the vessel or let the elements determine its fate.

The Alta caught the public’s imagination but locals bristle at the prospect of a rusting ruin remaining on their shores, a magnet for curious and in some cases reckless sightseers. Before Covid-19 restrictions there were reports of people boarding the vessel despite warnings that it was dangerous and unstable.

Salvage experts say the Alta has no commercial value and that the Irish state may never track down the owner.

“She’s too old and her scrap value would be low,” Mark Hoddinott, a salvage and wreck removal expert with Brand Marine, told RTE. “Whether the state would want to remove her just because she was an eyesore, I doubt. The cost of removing her would be quite considerable too – €5m-10m or I would say probably a bit higher. Is it really worth it? My own view would be probably not.”

Built in 1976, the Alta was flagged in Tanzania, changed owner in 2017 and was sailing from Greece to Haiti in September 2018 when it became disabled about 1,380 miles (2,220km) south-east of Bermuda.

Unable to make repairs, the 10-strong crew was rescued by the US coastguard and brought to Puerto Rico. The ship was reportedly towed to Guyana and then hijacked, its subsequent fate unclear until August 2019 when a Royal Navy ice patrol ship, HMS Protector, encountered it in the mid-Atlantic, apparently unmanned.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/ireland-faces-bill-for-millions-to-remove-ghost-ship-mv-alta-from-rocks

['Emily Holden'],2020-05-05,"Gas stoves making indoor air up to five times dirtier than outdoor air, report finds","Gas stoves are making people sick, contributing pollution that makes indoor air up to two to five times dirtier than outdoor air, according to a new report.

Despite the risks, regulators have failed to set standards for indoor air quality – a problem that is now likely to be exacerbated by large numbers of people spending time inside and cooking at home during the coronavirus pandemic.

Fossil-fuel-burning stoves are likely exposing tens of millions of Americans to air pollution levels that would be illegal if they were outside, concludes the review of decades of science by the Rocky Mountain Institute and multiple environmental advocacy groups.

Lead report author Brady Seals said little attention has been paid despite longstanding knowledge of the problem. “Somehow we’ve gotten accustomed to having a combustion device, often unvented, inside of the home,” Seals said.

About a third of US households cook primarily with gas – which emits nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide, in addition to the particle pollution that all types of stoves produce. Older, poorly maintained stoves pollute even more including risks from carbon monoxide.

Even small increases in short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide can increase asthma risks for children. One analysis found that children in homes with gas stoves have a 42% higher chance of having asthma symptoms. Another in Australia attributed 12.3% of all childhood asthma burden to gas stoves.

Nitrogen dioxide also makes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease worse and may be linked to heart problems, diabetes and cancer.

Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause a headache, nausea, a rapid heartbeat, cardiac arrest and death.

The best solution, according to the report, is to change to electric stoves. But individuals with gas stoves can also open windows, cook on their back burners, use an exhaust hood, run an air purifier with a HEPA filter and install a carbon monoxide detector.

Indoor air pollution hits poor Americans and people of color worse because they are often also exposed to lead, mercury, highways and industrial plants, said Dr Robert Gould, a California pathologist and board member for Physicians for Social Responsibility who peer-reviewed the report.

“We just need to make these investments,” Gould said. “This fits into an overall plan we would have to protect, particularly, our vulnerable populations.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/gas-stoves-air-pollution-environment
['Joe Parkin Daniels'],2020-05-05,Donald Trump denies link to Venezuela armed raid by US citizens,"Donald Trump has denied any involvement by the US government in what Venezuelan officials have called a failed armed incursion in the South American country that led to the capture of two American “mercenaries”.

The president made the comment to reporters at the White House after Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, announced that authorities there had detained two US citizens working with a US military veteran who has claimed responsibility for the foiled operation.

“We’ll find out. We just heard about it,” Trump said when asked about the incident and the Americans’ arrests. “But it has nothing to do with our government.”

In a televised address, Maduro said authorities arrested 13 “terrorists” on Monday involved in what he described as a plot coordinated with Washington to enter the country via the Caribbean coast and oust him.

Eight people were killed during the incursion attempt on Sunday, Venezuelan authorities said.

Maduro showed what he said were the US passports and other identification cards belonging to Airan Berry and Luke Denman, whom he said were in custody and had been working with Jordan Goudreau, an American military veteran who leads a Florida-based security company called Silvercorp USA.

The two detained Americans, former special operations forces members who had served with Goudreau, were believed to be in the custody of Venezuelan military intelligence, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Washington has waged a campaign of economic sanctions and diplomatic measures against Venezuela in an effort to oust Maduro, accusing him of having rigged elections in 2018.

But while Trump has repeatedly said all options are on the table, his administration has shown no apparent interest in military action as it pursues what it calls a “maximum pressure” strategy against Maduro.

Maduro’s government, however, says the United States wants to control the Opec member nation’s massive oil reserves.

Since early 2019, the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president.

But Maduro remains in power, backed by the military as well as Russia, Cuba and China, which some US officials say privately is a source of frustration for Trump.

Guaidó insisted that Maduro was seeking to distract from other problems in recent days, including a deadly prison riot and a violent days-long gang battle in Caracas, the capital.

Adding to the chaos, a blackout swept through parts of the country on Tuesday afternoon, leaving areas in 17 of the country’s 23 states without electricity.

NetBlocks, an internet observatory, reported that national connectivity was down to about 60% of ordinary levels. Widespread power outages – increasingly a mainstay of Venezuelan life – have been attributed to years of corrupt mismanagement of the energy sector.

David Smilde, a Venezuela analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, said he suspected that while the planned incursion into the country was probably the work of freelancing mercenaries, their plan may have been motivated by misguided and cavalier US policy.

US indicts Nicolás Maduro and other top Venezuelan leaders for drug trafficking Read more

“Put a $15m reward on Nicolás Maduro like we are in the wild west and you can pretty much count on some people acting like cowboys,” said Smilde in reference to indictments leveled at Maduro and his cronies.

“In the end this has strengthened the Maduro government in its efforts to look invincible, and has undermined the Guaidó government’s efforts to look legitimate and competent,” said Smilde.

Mike Vigil, the former head of international operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said to the AP: “It shocks me how insane they were. They walked right into a coiled rattlesnake without even having minimally studied the capacity of the Venezuelan armed forces.”

Vanessa Neumann, Guaidó’s envoy to the UK, denied any links with the failed incursion, but raised fears for the captured Americans.

“It is deeply unfortunate that they will become bargaining chips for the Maduro regime,” the diplomat said. “And that they will suffer the same awful conditions that Venezuelan prisoners also face, in crumbling jails with no healthcare during a pandemic,” Neumann said.

The 16 children, including the Swedish environmental activist, lodged a legal case with the UN committee on the rights of the child against Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey last September.

They alleged that the countries – which are legally obliged to protect children under the UN convention on the rights of the child – breached those obligations by failing to protect them from the “direct, imminent and foreseeable risk to their health and wellbeing” posed by the climate crisis.

Three countries – Brazil, France and Germany – have replied to the petition, saying it should not be admissible by the committee.

But on Tuesday the children hit back, arguing that the countries should be judged by their behaviour on the climate crisis. They said the three countries were all failing to cut their emissions in line with the Paris agreement.

In response to the objections raised by Brazil, France and Germany, the children said they had been “directly and foreseeably injured” by the greenhouse gas emissions that those governments had allowed to change the climate.

They have submitted new scientific research on how the countries are failing in their obligations, and said it would be “futile” to argue their case in separate domestic lawsuits in each country, as that “would not provide the type of far-reaching international relief needed to reverse climate change”.

Although 140 countries, excluding the US, have ratified the UN convention on the rights of the child, only 46 governments have adopted a protocol that allows for this kind of legal action. Of those, the five biggest greenhouse gas emitters – Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey – are targeted in the lawsuit, which has been brought by the children with the backing of the green campaigning group Earthjustice and the international law firm Hausfeld.

There has been no decision yet from the UN committee on whether to hear the legal complaint.

The lawsuit joins a growing number of attempts to bring climate cases to court, alleging that government or businesses have flouted the law or failed in their international obligations. One of the most successful has been in the Netherlands, in the Urgenda case, in which judges found the government must change its policies to tackle emissions and the climate crisis.

In the UK, campaigners brought a successful legal challenge that found the government was wrong to allow the expansion of Heathrow airport without taking into account its obligations under the Paris agreement. The ruling will have implications for other government plans likely to raise emissions, such as road-building schemes.

More than 1,300 legal actions have been brought around the world to try to force governments to confront the climate crisis. More than 1,000 are in the US; the highest profile case there, the Juliana case, was dismissed by judges earlier this year. There are similar cases ongoing in 28 countries including Ireland, Australia, Spain and New Zealand.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/greta-thunberg-and-childrens-group-hit-back-at-attempt-to-throw-out-climate-case
['Michael Safi'],2020-05-05,"Iran's state broadcaster meddled in Scottish referendum, says Facebook","Iran’s state broadcaster experimented with using fake social media accounts to influence the outcome of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and other western elections, according to a report from Facebook released on Tuesday.

The Iranian network, one of eight to be suspended for so-called “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” by the social media giant in April, points to efforts by state-linked groups to try to use Facebook to influence foreign democratic contests years before Russia’s alleged campaign against the 2016 US presidential contest.

The network was linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting Corporation and involved more than 500 accounts that claimed to be independent but amplified narratives favourable to Tehran, according to Graphika, a social network analysis company that was allowed to independently verify Facebook’s findings.

The pages and accounts involved dated back to 2011 and targeted audiences in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. Some had thousands of followers and operated for years while others were quickly deleted without drawing much engagement.

The network’s targets briefly included the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, about which a handful of accounts posted pro-leave content including several cartoons portraying then prime minister David Cameron as “the embodiment of English oppression”, the Graphika report said.

The network also promoted the 2012 US presidential bid by libertarian candidate Ron Paul and the anti-capitalist Occupy movement, but the efforts in all three cases were brief and made little impact.

“The focus on western democratic exercises appears to have been a short-lived experiment conducted with a relatively small number of accounts: it did not have the scale, the sophistication, or the duration of the later Russian efforts,” it said.

Its more sustained campaigns were in Arabic. It published memes and linked to articles that were critical of Iran’s geopolitical foes, especially Israel and Saudi Arabia. More recent content mentioned coronavirus, framing the pandemic as an attack on Iran by a foreign enemy and a reason to lift sanctions on both Iran and Syria.

The influence network was notable less for its success than for its start date, Graphika said, showing that state attempts to meddle in democratic elections were underway years before they became prominent with the efforts of Russian-linked groups to sow division and promote Donald Trump.

Both Facebook and Twitter have identified several Iranian influence operations on their networks and the Islamic Republic is regarded as one of the most persistent actors in the field.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/irans-state-broadcaster-meddled-in-scottish-referendum

The UAE, including skyscraper-studded Dubai, has suffered a spate of fires in its high-rises in recent years.

The reason, building and safety experts say, is the material used for the buildings’ sidings, called aluminium composite panel cladding.

['Tim Jonze'],2020-05-05,Is Jenny from the block or the yacht? The poll taking the temperature of our times,"Locked down in Milan, the artist Francesco Vezzoli has decided to survey the world’s emotional state under coronavirus – with a little help from art history, pop culture and Prada

“I haven’t seen a human being for 65 days,” says Italian artist Francesco Vezzoli from his home in lockdown Milan. “I think I’m developing a very tiny bit of agoraphobia.”

As an artist whose work so often involves people gathering for grand social occasions – among other things he’s convinced Gore Vidal and Helen Mirren to create a trailer for an imaginary remake of Caligula and persuaded Kate Moss to DJ at a 24-hour exhibition in Paris – quarantine does not come naturally for Vezzoli. It doesn’t help that he’s originally from Brescia in the north of Italy – “one of the biggest red dots in Europe” as he puts it.

“It’s been incredibly intense,” he admits. “I found myself going online at three in the morning, to check the local newspapers to see if there were people I knew among the dead. When you’re living alone the news can get in your head. So you calling me right now is the perfect excuse to change the channel!”

Luckily for Vezzoli, fashion house Prada also came calling recently with a welcome distraction. They’ve commissioned him to make Love Stories: A Sentimental Survey by Francesco Vezzoli, a fun (if entirely unscientific) way of taking a snapshot of the Italian mood during this emotionally fragile time. “It has been the biggest gift of my life,” laughs Vezzoli. “They’ve managed to take my brain away [from the pandemic].”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cultural barometer ... from Love Stories – A Sentimental Survey by Francesco Vezzoli. Photograph: Francesco Vezzoli/Courtesy Fondazione Prada

The project was commissioned with lockdown in mind, but Vezzoli says he’s long dreamed of hiring one of the big polling companies to survey his nation’s emotional state. Instead of a pollster, though, he’ll be using the poll function on Instagram Stories – each weekday from 11 May an image of a famous couple will appear and viewers will be able to vote for one of two pithy phrases written by Vezzoli. For example, a photograph of Miss Piggy and Kermit will offer the audience the choice between “non-binary couple” and “a love supreme”; an image of James Dean and Marlon Brando gives you the options “Slave & Master” or “Hair & Make Up”. It’s not all pop culture – some couples are taken from paintings by Caravaggio or Toulouse-Lautrec.

“And there’s one picture of Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret,” says Vezzoli. “They’re both looking at something that we don’t see in such a different way. Under the Queen the word says ‘finding’ and under her sister I put ‘looking’.”

The project is, he says, about the complexity of relationships, as well as acting as a cultural barometer: “It will be interesting to measure how many people react to each image – have they forgotten certain icons that maybe in the art world we think are totally recognisable but are no longer relevant to a younger generation?”

Each week’s results will be posted on Saturdays, and on Sunday Vezzoli has invited an array of cultural critics, historians and artists to comment on them, from Klaus Biesenbach, the director of Moca in Los Angeles, to “the most important ancient art historian in Italy” Salvatore Settis. I wonder how these critics will be expected to make sense of the poll’s results, given they seem rather open to interpretation – but that, Vezzoli says, is the whole point. “I have no idea what will happen!” he laughs. “The beauty of the project is that these people have total freedom to make their own interpretation of other people’s interpretations. Everything is up for critical grabs. It’s all a big collaborative game, a distraction … just a lot of fun to be honest.”

Vezzoli’s work often seems “just a lot of fun”. It can be flashy, gleefully shallow, a little daft – but dig deeper and it contains political undertones. In 2009 he filmed Natalie Portman and Michelle Williams wrestling over a perfume bottle in an advert for a fake fragrance called Greed – all quite silly, yet clearly a satire on the Berlusconi era too.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Greed – video by Francesco Vezzoli

This work is no different, says Vezzoli. “There’s an image of Ronald Reagan dancing with Imelda Marcos where they’re both dressed in white satin,” he says. “So of course if you figure out who they are you start asking – why is the president of the United States dancing with the wife of a dictator? Did this really happen? So I think most of the questions are political, even if it’s just asking if Jenny is from the block or the yacht.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘It’s all a big collaborative game’ ... from Love Stories – A Sentimental Survey. Photograph: Francesco Vezzoli/Courtesy Fondazione Prada

What Vezzoli seems most proud about with Love Stories is the fact that it’s a genuinely digital artwork. “You’re seeing galleries trying to digitise themselves in this moment … but being digital doesn’t mean a drone with a camera flying around your institution! Online viewing rooms are just analogue ways of thinking put online. With Love Stories, I don’t say if it’s a good exhibition or a bad one, but it’s a real digital exhibition.”

It’s tempting to think that such projects will become commonplace as coronavirus changes the art landscape, but Vezzoli advises caution with any bold predictions: “After the Lehman Brothers crash there was a naive hope that it might bring a higher degree of morality into the art world,” he says. “Instead we saw the opposite – the rich in the art world got richer, the rest got wiped away. When this is over people may end up bingeing on comfort food rather than nouvelle cuisine. But then hopefully, after that, there will be an explosion of something completely new.

“The world has seen tragedies like this before but never within a hyper-technological environment,” he continues. “We have no idea how this will impact on our brains. I haven’t left my apartment for so long that it has generated in me new emotions that I’ve never dealt with before. It’s unfathomable. I just hope that gentleness will be one of the feelings people respond with.”

And will this project at least give the isolated Vezzoli a greater sense of human contact?

“Oh yeah!” he exclaims. “Even just this interview is making me feel more human, more alive again! It’s been very healthy for my brain and for my heart.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/05/is-jenny-from-the-block-or-the-yacht-the-poll-taking-the-temperature-of-our-times
['Poppy Noor'],2020-05-05,‘It makes me feel human’: 11 women share their lockdown beauty regimens,"We’re interacting less with the outside world – and the societal pressures that come with it. Are some women still wearing makeup every day?

The shutdown feels like a good opportunity to examine an age-old feminist question: when women put makeup on, can they ever truly be doing it for themselves?

We will probably never have an answer. The pressure imposed on women to look good is such a part of our existence that we might never get rid of it – even “dressing up for oneself” can be traced back to self-hatred fueled by a beauty-obsessed culture.

Celebrities happy in their own skin? Don't take it at face value Read more

But the shutdown means that we interact less with the outside world and the societal pressures that come with it. We asked women about their own relationship to their appearance right now. Are some wearing a full face of makeup every day? Wearing a bra? And who still dresses up, anyway? Here are their answers.

Dina Gachman, Texas

Before everything shut down in Austin, I would put on mascara and lipstick (Clinique Chunky Cherry) every day, even though I work from home as a writer. My southern belle mom always taught us to “put on a little lipstick” no matter what – advice I hated as a teen. Somewhere along the way, I figured she was right. I still put on mascara and lipstick in quarantine, even though I know it’s ridiculous. It makes me feel human. It brings some normalcy to a very abnormal and scary time and It lifts my mood, even if I’m just walking to the mailbox.

Sarah Skiles, Los Angeles

I grew a unibrow, named it Angelina: Conquerer of Space and Time. I wanted to see what it would look like since I’ve done upkeep since I was 14. I was disappointed by the results, which in no way made me resemble Frida Kahlo. Sparse. Too many years of plucking.

Sarah Wilson, Leeds

I feel much happier with my natural appearance after a month in lockdown. I’ve worn makeup pretty much every day since I was about 14, even though in recent years I’ve cut down to just a bit of foundation and mascara. I believed I had an uneven and blotchy skin tone, but having now not worn a scrap of makeup for a month (probably the longest I’ve gone without it in nine years) I actually like the way my skin looks. I feel like I’m going to have the confidence to just stop wearing makeup once this is all over.

Niamh Ronan, London

I’ve spent even more time scrutinising and hating my appearance in lockdown. I’m still doing my makeup almost every day and trying to make myself look presentable because I can’t be [bothered] to get upset by my reflection. I am still tinting my eyebrows, doing a full skincare routine, tonight I think I will fake tan. It is kind of depressing. I really wanted this to be the time where I’d get slightly comfortable in my own skin, but actually I can’t. Especially not now – it’s too much work to unravel years of self-hatred during a crisis.

Ariadne Braso, Philadelphia

Since shutdown, I’m not wearing whole parts of my wardrobe, getting haircuts or getting my hair colored. The only makeup I really wear is eyeliner and i still put that on when I’m going outside.

It’s not about confidence, it’s much more about the way I see myself Ariadne Braso

As a trans person – I haven’t gotten the whole laser hair removal on my face yet, so I still shave my face and I have found myself not shaving, not consciously, but if i don’t go out I don’t do it. Trans-femme people can get really stressed out about body hair, but I’m fortunate to have very thin facial hair and body hair so I don’t notice it too much.

Now when I look in the mirror I feel more stripped down. It’s not about confidence, it’s much more about the way I see myself. I see myself as very colorful and vibrant and so that’s why I dress up the way I do. Right now it feels like some of the functions through which I normally express myself are disabled. In the past i have thought of myself as pretty vain but now I realize it’s not about being vain, it’s about not getting to express myself, and feeling like parts of myself are stifled.

Danielle Emina, London

I honestly don’t know how I’m going to go back to wearing a bra after this?

Frances Forbes-Carbines, London

I am 30 and rather overweight. Favorite dresses no longer zip up the back, and as all the shops are closed I’m having to order dresses online, without of course trying them on first. I’m eating somewhat wantonly: takeaways, large portions of meat and veg too. My face is unusually spotty. A couple of massive subcutaneous beasts lurk on my cheeks of all places, never rising to the surface. I put expensive green highlighter on them to make them less apparent, but now it looks like I have marker pen on my face. I doll myself up daily, thinking I want to look nice to walk my little dog. My leg hair grows and I shave it occasionally so I can wear my dresses.

All in all I am discontented with my appearance in lockdown. I find all body types beautiful but I feel heavy and like my excess weight is tiring me out. I post maudlinly on social media about my excess weight and receive no likes. The lack of face-to-face contact with friends makes me blue, as well as lack of opportunities to go on dates and have occasions to dress up for.

Allison Alexy, Michigan

I think all I’ve learned is that lighting matters more than anything else? Oh wait, and also that my hair is so flat it looks drawn on with a pencil. Two lessons! Someone said that what we realize now is that the best part of going out to dinner with your friends is that you don’t have to look at your own face for that whole time. And it’s true – I have been recording my lectures and it is humbling, man. To watch myself on a video is the worst.

Elisabeth Gampel, Munich

Since the lockdown, I love to wear no makeup. It is the first time I feel beautiful without it. I also wear sneakers (I normally do not like them because it reminds me of my childhood in a poor, working-class family), and I do not miss business clothes. And I do not want to wear a bra again.

Sara Sloves, New York

I don’t have the same morning routine anymore and I am mostly wearing sports clothes. When I do take a shower, if I know I’m going to go running, I’ll put on sunscreen and a little bit of makeup – mascara and a little bit of eyeshadow. It makes me feel more awake and I feel like it’s nice for other people to see something nice. I am having a little fun with it – wearing mismatching or stripy tights or something a little festive when I run, because life is a bummer right now. We can’t control it, so trying to control what you can control helps a little bit.

Afia Chaudhury, London

You’d think quarantine would see to me not taking care of my appearance and elucidate that this dressing up is for others. But it’s proved that I do it for moi. I love looking/feeling buff. And as a Muslim when you pray you’re supposed to look your best, so may as well stunt to the heavens.

The Oscar-winning actor was photographed just before lockdown for the magazine’s June issue, but the accompanying interview explores her experiences self-isolating at home in Surrey.

“I am sure I feel like everyone else, such unprecedented times are quite hard to comprehend,” she says. “What is a good thing is that it has made people aware of the predicament of others who are completely alone. If a great deal of kindness comes out of this, then that will be a plus.”

Dench has become an unlikely social media star during the Covid-19 crisis, appearing in videos posted by family members, despite not using social media personally.

Last month her daughter, Finty Williams, posted a Twitter video of Dench, wearing a novelty dog hat with pop up ears, saying: “Just keep laughing. That’s all we can do”. It has now been watched 5.4 million times.

Earlier this month Dench and her grandson Sam Williams did a TikTok dance to the song Cheryl by the US rapper Yung Gravy. The same week a video of her washing her hands with Gyles Brandreth while reciting ‘The Owl and the Pussy-cat’ went viral.

The Vogue interview describes Dench as “a kind of cultural tea cosy to be popped soothingly over the nation’s beleaguered identity in times of crisis.”

Dench is photographed in a pink, floral silk organza Dolce & Gabbana trench coat for the magazine, which is out on 7 May. In further images she wears a cream silk Armani Prive tunic. Much less stylish, she says, was the costume of the much-maligned Cats film. “The cloak I was made to wear! Like five foxes fucking on my back!” she said. “A battered, mangy old cat… A great big orange bruiser.

Before the lockdown, I had a boyfriend with whom I had been for 16 months. He said he wanted to experiment sexually with another couple, which I found shocking. I am not that kind of person, so I broke up with him. Despite the breakup, he is still constantly texting me, even though I stopped texting him a while back and made it clear I don’t want to see him. The situation hurts me so much, and any help you could offer would be much appreciated.

Joining another couple for erotic fun is not uncommon; many people enjoy it. In fact, there are many communities of people who regularly participate in this sexual style. But it is not for everyone, and jealousies and insecurities can arise no matter how sexually open a person is. “Swinging” is advanced sexual play that requires a couple to be well bonded and requires each partner to be psychologically stable as well as sexually mature.

Rules, transparency, careful negotiation and mutual consent are necessary. In your case, you have been quite clear with your boyfriend that this is not at all to your taste. A caring person would have respected that. Unfortunately, he is not taking “no” for an answer and is trying to coerce you into changing your mind.

Although you are feeling hurt right now, it would be best if you followed your intuition and stayed away from him – not because of his particular sexual interests, but because of his insensitivity and bullying.

The Trump administration is poised to break up the White House coronavirus taskforce, the public face of the US response to the virus, even as experts warn that the worst is yet to come. Here is what we know so far about the taskforce and where the US stands in its response to Covid-19.

What is the coronavirus taskforce?

Days after public health officials announced the first confirmed case of Covid-19 on US soil on 21 January, the White House announced that it had formed a taskforce that would lead the federal government’s response to the pandemic. The group, it said, would work together to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus in the US and keep the public informed about important public health and travel guidance.

By March, as the US reported thousands of new cases of Covid-19 every day, the taskforce gave daily press briefings, ostensibly to update Americans about the public health emergency.

But at the end of April, the briefings stopped. The last press conference was held on 24 April. According to reports, Trump’s advisers said his daily appearances were hurting his chance of re-election in November, especially after he suggested – with no evidence – that disinfectant could fight the virus in human bodies.

Why is the White House ending the coronavirus taskforce?

Pence insisted that “it really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country”, despite data on the continuing public health risk.

Recently there has been some tension in messaging about the virus from key members of the group.

Fauci has cautioned that the US needs to have enough testing capacity to reopen safely, and is not yet at that stage. Fauci said the US will need to double its current level of testing within several weeks.

“I don’t think there’s a chance that this virus is just going to disappear,” he told National Geographic. “It’s going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge.”

But acknowledging that the US is still behind on testing does not chime with Trump’s messaging.

In recent days, Trump has started to amp up talk about reopening the economy, saying Tuesday morning that it was “going to happen pretty fast”.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/05/coronavirus-us-live-fauci-warns-against-rush-reopen-trump-cuomo-latest-news-updates

[],2020-02-21,Win two tickets to Andy Warhol & a meal for two at Tate Modern,"An exhibition is one of our go-to ideas for a date, and with the new Andy Warhol retrospective opening on 12 March, we are excited, to say the least. The first Warhol exhibition at Tate Modern in almost 20 years, it’s a new look at the extraordinary work of the pop art icon, emphasising recurring themes around desire, identity and belief that emerge from his biography.

To celebrate, we’ve teamed up to create the perfect Tate date, giving away a pair of tickets to one lucky winner, as well as dinner for two from the Warhol-inspired @TateEats menu. The creative snacking menu features dishes such as Pâté with the Cat and Chocks cream cheese sandwich, followed by Warhol’s preferred course – the sweets – including Cornflakes Pannacotta and Mars Cake.

To enter, all you need to do is go to our Instagram page, like the competition post and leave a comment on why you’d like to see the exhibition.

Andy Warhol will be open from 12 March – 6 September 2020 at Tate Modern. This exhibition is in partnership with Bank of America.

Follow @TateEats for other dishes to try with a date.",theguardian,https://soulmates.theguardian.com/blog/dating-locations/dating/win-two-tickets-to-andy-warhol-a-meal-for-two-at-tate-modern
[],2020-01-10,Exude Confidence in Your Dating Profile,"With January round the corner, we’re about to enter peak busy time for online dating. The quickest way to up your dating profile game is to get yourself some new profile pictures that showcase you at your best… but sometimes that is easier said than done.

We spoke to the UK dating photography expert, Saskia Nelson about how you can exude confidence in your dating profile photos.

Get comfortable in front of the lens

OK, this may sound a bit like hard work but it really works. Before you head off on your photoshoot, spend a little time in front of the mirror and practice some different looks and get a feel for what you’re doing with your mouth, chin etc when you like yourself the most in the shot. Then experiment taking some selfies – don’t worry, you can delete them straight afterwards, but it is a quick and easy first step to getting comfortable in front of the lens.

Confident people take up room

Remember a time when you were on fire

This always helps me. Think back to a time when you were absolutely on fire; it might be that time you delivered the presentation of your life or you stunned an audience with your knockout version of Killing Me Softly. Now remember how you felt about yourself. Amazing wasn’t it? If you can access that feeling and channel it in front of the camera, you’ll just shine in your profile photos. It takes a little practice but it is hugely effective once you’ve got the hang of it.

Ground yourself

Grounding techniques are designed to redistribute the energy from your head or mind into your body and doing so has an almost instant calming effect. We want calm confidence in your profile photos (rather than arrogant confidence). I love using grounding techniques before I have to do anything that makes me feel nervous, it immediately relaxes me and feelings of confidence usually follow.

There are different ways to ground yourself and some are super quick and effective. I like to breathe in and visualise my breath moving through me starting at my feet and moving all the way up my body to my head and back down again. Sometimes just a hand on top of your head for 30 seconds is very grounding. You need to try it to believe it.

Own the space

Wear that hot first date outfit

Once you’re channelling the right mindset, you need the outfits to match. The easiest way to do this is to wear something that you’d usually choose for a hot first date. You know the outfit, the one that curves in all the right places and makes heads turn. That outfit is the one that is going to help build on your new-found confidence.

Take up space

Mastering your body language is the quickest way to come across as confident, even if you’re really struggling to feel it. Don’t be afraid to take up room. Confident people take up room. They’re not shrinking themselves to fit in. The easiest way to do this is to use open body language, not closed. Don’t ‘cross anything’, like arms or legs. Crossed arms, in particular, come across as defensive at best, aggressive at worst. Open arms and hands come across as warm and welcoming. Don’t shrink away from the lens, open yourself up to it. Own the space.

Hold something

A really quick and easy way to feel confident is to grab hold of something. It’s human nature to wonder what to do with your hands when you’re having your photo taken so holding something immediately relaxes you. Even better, hold something that tells people a bit more about who you are. That might be a camera, a favourite book, a notebook and pen, a yoga mat, a bike, even your dog (if they’re well behaved).

Have fun

If all else fails just aim to connect with your photographer (if they’re good, they’ll make this really easy to do) and make the decision to relax and enjoy their company. Experiment, go with the flow, have fun. Sit, stand, turn, dance, have a laugh and your photographer is bound to get some great natural shots. Fake smiles don’t reach your eyes so the best way to get genuinely happy, laughing shots is to just go for it and have a good time.",theguardian,https://soulmates.theguardian.com/blog/advice/how-to-exude-confidence-in-your-dating-profile-photos
