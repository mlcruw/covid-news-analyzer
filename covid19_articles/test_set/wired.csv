"['Daniel Oberhaus', 'Daniel Oberhau', 'Sarah Scoles']",,Does It Matter That the DOD Released Those UFO Videos?,"On Monday, the US Department of Defense officially released three videos depicting encounters between Navy pilots and unidentified aerial phenomena. These events occurred in 2004 and 2015, but the videos didn’t publicly surface until The New York Times included them with a front-page story about the Pentagon’s “mysterious UFO program” in 2017. The Navy previously acknowledged that the videos are authentic, but the Pentagon never authorized them for release. Now it has.

The WIRED Guide to Aliens Everything you need to know about SETI, the Drake equation, ’Oumuamua, and hot tubs.

Each of the three videos contains footage captured by Navy pilots that show a strange-looking oval zipping through the air and over the ocean. In a video from 2015 called “Gimbal,” a flying object shaped like a Tic Tac whips through the clouds before it slows and begins to rotate. The pilot filming the encounter describes it over the radio as “a fucking drone, bro.” In another video from 2015, referred to as “Go Fast,” a small white speck is tracked by a jet’s infrared system as it flies low over the ocean. The oldest video, “FLIR1,” is also from a jet infrared system and shows an oval object rapidly accelerating.

The videos were originally published by The New York Times and To the Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences, a company founded by former Blink-182 frontman Tom DeLonge to research UFOs and other unexplained phenomena. When the videos were released in 2017, To the Stars staffers claimed that the footage had “been through the official declassification review process and has been approved for public release.”

Video: U.S. Department of Defense

“All videos were previously reviewed by the cognizant DOD authority under the 1910 process and were cleared for ‘unrestricted release’ by the Defense Office of Prepublication Security Review,” says Luis Elizondo, To the Stars’ director of government programs and services. Elizondo is a former Department of Defense employee who claims to have led its Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, the “mysterious UFO program” alluded to in the Times report. The “1910 process” refers to the Defense Department form 1910 used to request clearance to release DOD information to the public.

But in their statement this week, Pentagon officials describe the 2017 release as “unauthorized.” Three years later, the DOD is finally ready to authorize the videos … even though they’ve already been watched by millions of people. “After a thorough review, the department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena,” Department of Defense officials wrote in a press release published on Monday.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/does-it-matter-that-the-dod-released-those-ufo-videos#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Paris Martineau', 'Paris Martinea']",,"Which States Are Reopening, Which Remain on Lockdown, and Why","In the absence of clear federal oversight, state and local officials have led public health responses to the novel coronavirus. Over the past two months, officials across the nation have shuttered bars and restaurants, imposed curfews, and prohibited large gatherings in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, which has infected more than a million Americans and killed more than 64,000. By April 1, all but five states had issued statewide or local shelter in place orders to protect public health.

Now some officials are allowing businesses to reopen, citing concerns about the economic impacts of the shutdown, while others extend restrictions. The decentralized approach has led to a lack of consistency, breeding confusion among residents and small business owners. In Georgia and Oklahoma, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors can reopen under new state guidelines, but in Texas and Iowa—where officials have permitted restaurants and retailers to resume operations—they must remain closed.

This guide will be updated as new restrictions are imposed or lifted. Last Update: May 1, 2020, 5:30 pm.

Alabama

Governor Kay Ivey ordered all Alabama residents to shelter in place beginning April 4, after repeatedly insisting such an action was not necessary. It did not last long. Ivey later signed an executive order allowing all retail stores to reopen at 50 percent capacity starting April 30.

""We know that what we are announcing today will please some and make others frustrated that we're not going further at this time, but our job must be always to find the right balance,” Ivey said at a press conference on the reopening plans.

Alaska

Governor Mike Dunleavy relaxed his “Hunker Down” order for the state, which went into effect on March 28. Beginning April 24, restaurants, retail stores, person care services, gyms, law firms, and marketing offices were permitted to reopen, with restrictions. Restaurants and personal care services may serve customers in-house by reservation only, and strict social distancing and disinfection procedures must be in place.

Arizona

Governor Doug Ducey ordered all Arizona residents to shelter in place beginning March 31.

On April 29, Ducey announced he would extend the state's stay at home order to May 15, with some changes aimed at slowly reopening Arizona's economy. Retail stores will be permitted to reopen starting May 4, and can expand their operations on May 8, provided they follow strict state guidelines. Ducey said he intends to permit restaurants to open later in the month, though he has not identified a date.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/which-states-reopening-lockdown#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Medea Giordano', 'Medea Giordan', 'Jeffrey Van Cam']",,How to Make a CDC-Approved Cloth Face Mask,"The time has come to start covering your face. As we reported April 3, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends all citizens voluntarily wear a cloth face mask for essential trips out of the house to the grocery store, doctor, or other public places where the 6-foot social distancing rules may be difficult to maintain. In short, most places.

Wearing a cloth mask might help protect people around you, if you happen to be infected with Covid-19 but do not have symptoms yet. (These are Covid-19's typical symptoms.) Some individuals infected with Covid-19 never show symptoms or do not get very sick, especially if they are young. Basically, these masks mainly help others, not you—though if used properly, a cloth mask may help you avoid touching your face and infecting yourself while out of the house.

Be sure to frequently wash masks in the washing machine with regular detergent.

Updated April 23: We updated links, checked information in this article, and added a section on how to approach buying a mask, if you plan to do that.

Whether you are wearing a face covering or not, the CDC still recommends that you:

Wash your hands regularly. Use soap and water, and wash them for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizer is acceptable to use if you are unable to wash your hands.

Cover your face when coughing with a tissue or the inside of your elbow.

Avoid touching your face , because you could transmit the virus from your hands into your mouth.

Stay at home , except for essential trips outside like trips to the grocery store or to see your doctor. This is also called sheltering in place.

Practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from other people. The White House also recommends avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people, which should be easy because you're staying at home.

Clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces daily (here's our Covid-19 cleaning guide).

Some Mask Rules:

Do not buy and hoard medical masks . Health care professionals are already facing a devastating shortage in supplies, and we should not use protective masks that ill patients and health care workers may need.

Do not put a face mask on kids under 2 years old —or anyone who has difficulty breathing or might be unable to remove the mask themselves.

Do not remove a mask by its mouth area . Grab it by the straps. Wash your hands after touching it.

Do not just wear a standard bandana or scarf. Follow the instructions below to create a mask that has multiple layers and more tightly covers your face.

3 Ways to Make Your Own Face Covering

The CDC released directions for several DIY masks, as well as a short instructional video outlining its no-sew mask-making advice. We've put the instructions below.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-make-a-cloth-face-mask#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Condé Nast', 'Parker Hal']",,Google Pixel Buds (2020) Review: Better Than AirPods,"It’s taken Google a surprisingly long time to make good earbuds. The original Pixel Buds from 2018 were a bulky, mushroom-shaped mess that made you look like Frankenstein’s monster. The charging case was huge, the sound was middling, and when you finally worked up the courage to go outside with them, it felt like everyone wearing AirPods was laughing at you.

My expectations were muted last fall when Google announced a revamped pair with the same name—this time with no wire connecting the buds, just like offerings from Apple, Samsung, and Amazon. On specs alone, they're not remarkable. They’ve got five hours of battery life, which is short, especially compared to the 11 hours you get with Samsung's buds. They're also $179, making them $20 more than Apple's AirPods.

And yet, somehow, I’ve fallen in love with Google’s tiny, rounded earbuds. Especially as someone with an Android phone, I’d take these over nearly any wireless earbuds around.

Good Looks

Photograph: Google

The new Pixel Buds come with a case that's similar in size and design to the floss-like AirPods case, though Google's is a bit more rounded with a nice matte finish instead of Apple’s shiny plastic. I think it looks like a cute, little egg.

The buds no longer have a cable running between them, and they're tiny. How do they stay secure in your ears? Each bud has a long, elephant-like trunk that culminates in a cozy silicone eartip, with cute ear fins that protrude out of the top for increased stability. That means that when you wear them for the full five-hour charge time, you won't have the same annoying pain you might have after five hours of listening to the hard-tipped AirPods.

That comfort isn't just because of the silicone tips; these are some of the lightest buds around.

Exceptionally Usable

As much as I dislike the sound (and idiotic, eartip-less design) offered by AirPods, I understand why they’re the best-selling wireless headphones on the planet. By integrating its own special chips, Apple makes pairing, listening, and talking on the AirPods much easier than the competition.

In terms of setup and ease of use, the Pixel Buds are the closest to match it. When I popped open the lid of the case, they instantly paired to my Pixel 4, quickly setting themselves up for hands-free access to Google Assistant, much as AirPods do with Siri. (They'll pair this fast on most Android phones). You can tweak settings in the companion app, but you probably won’t need to download it. The Pixel Buds (like AirPods) will probably work exactly the way you want right out of the box.

Even the touch controls, located on the outside of each earbud, are well thought out. You can raise or lower volume by sliding your fingers left and right—so easy!—as well as play or pause music and change songs with various taps. Unlike other buds with touch controls, I never accidentally paused music when adjusting them in my ears, but I do love that they automatically pause when you pull 'em out.

Specs-wise, they leave me wanting more. I wish the battery lasted longer, though the case does net you an additional 19 hours. That’s AirPods-matching battery life, sure, but you can get earbuds that last longer for less than half the price.

It's nice to have wireless charging built in (you can also use a USB-C cable). Just don't try it on a vertical wireless charging stand, because the coils are often a bit too high up to reach it. They juice up best on a pad.

They boast an IPX4 rating unlike AirPods, so I don’t have to worry about taking them on long, sock-testing runs in wet weather conditions. And I prefer Google Assistant over Siri as well. It's better at answering questions, setting timers, sending emails and texts, and various other voice-based tasks.

Heck, I can even use Google Assistant’s real-time language-translation tool to understand what my partner (who insists I know more Spanish than I actually do) is saying in attempts to maintain fluency in quarantine. It works pretty OK!

Great Sound

Photograph: Google

You might occasionally use voice commands to text someone back or ask Assistant the weather, but the vast majority of your time with the Pixel Buds will be spent listening to music. For audio quality, these are some of the best wireless earbuds I’ve tried.

They've got one of the more nuanced sound signatures I’ve ever heard in portable earbuds. Every instrument comes through with crystal clarity, which makes denser mixes like Foxygen’s ""San Francisco"" come through with elegant depth. You hear the tinny cymbals in the middle, the beautiful piano notes on the far right side, with chugging acoustic guitars on the left. Each has its own musical space.

I’m convinced that the key to such musical detail is the lack of boom in the bass. You can feel and hear every bass drum kick and plucked bass string, but they never overwhelm the low-midrange like on other earbuds. This gives the Pixel Buds a very “flat,” studio-style sound.

If you need oodles of bass to propel you through a workout, these might not be for you. But if you’re after a very detailed, compelling sound, you’ll have a hard time finding better earbuds without spending hundreds more. When it comes to audio quality, they kick the crap out of Apple's cheapest AirPods.

AirPods for Android?

Are these the best wirefree earbuds you can buy for $179? No. I like the Master and Dynamic MW07 Go and Jabra Elite Active 75T just as much as I like these earbuds, and they’ve got better battery life and higher sweatproof ratings.

And unlike more expensive models from the likes of Apple and Sony, these buds don't have any noise canceling. There are understandable reasons why. Noise canceling eats battery life and probably would have made each bud bulkier. The passive noise isolation (the earplug effect of the earbuds in my ears) is more than enough to block out most outside sounds, but you might want to spring for a noise-canceling pair if you're desperate for absolute silence.

Still, I like the Pixel Buds for a different reason. One that’s not really quantifiable when looking at a spec sheet. These are made for the traditional AirPod buyer: someone who wants a pair of headphones that work exactly as expected, every time you use them. For that, they’re the best you’ll find for Android phones. Given the unmitigated disaster that was the first Pixel Buds, I’m thoroughly impressed.",wired,https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-buds-2020#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Shawn Yuan', 'Shawn Yua']",,Inside the Early Days of China’s Coronavirus Coverup,"Late on the night of February 2, as her insomnia kicked in, a Beijing woman whom I’ll call Yue took out her phone and religiously clicked open WeChat and Weibo. Over the past two fitful weeks, the two Chinese social media platforms had offered practically her only windows into the “purgatory,” as she called it, of Wuhan.

At this point, according to official estimates, the novel coronavirus had infected just over 14,000 people in the world—and nearly all of them were in the central Chinese city where Yue had attended university and lived for four years. A number of her friends there had already caught the mysterious virus.

An inveterate news junkie, Yue hadn’t been able to look away from the ghastly updates pouring out of Wuhan, which—interspersed with a dissonant bombardment of posts praising the Chinese government’s iron grip on the outbreak—kept hitting her in an unrelentingly personal way. Her mental health was fraying, and she was “disappointed in humanity,” as she later put it.

That night, just when Yue was about to log off and try to sleep, she saw the following sentence pop up on her WeChat Moments feed, the rough equivalent of Facebook’s News Feed: “I never thought in my lifetime I’d see dead bodies lying around without being collected and patients seeking medical help but having no place to get treatment.”

Yue thought that she had become desensitized, but this post made her fists clench: It was written by Xiao Hui, a journalist friend of hers who was reporting on the ground for Caixin, a prominent Chinese news outlet. Yue trusted her.

She read on. “On January 22, on my second day reporting in Wuhan, I knew this was China’s Chernobyl,” Xiao Hui wrote. “These days I rarely pick up phone calls from outside of Wuhan or chat with friends and family, because nothing can express what I have seen here.”

Unable to contain her anger, Yue took a screenshot of Xiao’s post and immediately posted it on her WeChat Moments. “Look what is happening in Wuhan!” she wrote. Then she finally drifted off.

The next morning, when she opened WeChat, a single message appeared: Her account had been suspended for having “spread malicious rumors” and she would not be able to unblock it. She knew at once that her late-night post had stepped on a censorship landmine.

What she couldn’t have realized, though, was that she had posted her screenshot at what seems to have been a turning point in China’s handling of the epidemic: Over the previous two weeks, the government had allowed what felt like an uncharacteristic degree of openness in the flow of information out of Wuhan. But now the state was embarking on a campaign of censorship and suppression that would be remarkable even by the standards of the Chinese Communist Party.

Over the past several weeks, as the number of new cases in China has tapered off and lockdowns have lifted, China has been positioning itself as a global leader in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. It has vigorously promoted the narrative that its unprecedented quarantine measures bought time for the world—and that much of the world then botched and squandered that head start. Now, the story goes, China has again come to the rescue as it shares its expertise, experience, and equipment.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-early-days-of-chinas-coronavirus-coverup#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Boone Ashworth', 'Boone Ashwort']",,How to Make Your Own Hand Sanitizer,"Properly scrubbing your hands is one of the best ways to stop the spread of germs and viruses, and to ensure you don’t get sick yourself. But if you don't have access to soap and clean water, or if you're out and about and nowhere near a sink, you should carry hand sanitizer to protect your health.

As you're no doubt aware, bottles of hand sanitizer (Purell, Wet Ones, and the like) sell out quickly during public health crises. But don't worry—making your own hand sanitizer is remarkably easy. You just have to be careful you don't mess it up. Make sure that the tools you use for mixing are properly sanitized; otherwise you could contaminate the whole thing. Also, the World Health Organization recommends letting your concoction sit for a minimum of 72 hours after you're done. That way the sanitizer has time to kill any bacteria that might have been introduced during the mixing process.

We actually have two recipes for you, along with links to find the ingredients. The first is one you can make with stuff you likely already have in your cabinets and under the sink, so it's effective in emergency situations. The second recipe is more complex, but easy to make if you have the opportunity to do some shopping and planning ahead of time. Another note: A lot of these items are quickly going out of stock because of high demand. There's a higher chance of finding them at your local drug store, but your first priority is to stay indoors.

Updated April 15: We've refreshed the links in this guide and added some more detailed advice on other standard measures you should be taking.

(Note: If you buy something using the links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission. Here’s how this works.)

Potency Matters

You’re going to need some alcohol. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, your sanitizer mix must be at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective. But it's better to get way above that—aim for a minimum of 75 percent. A bottle of 99 percent isopropyl alcohol is the best thing to use. Your regular vodka and whiskey are too wimpy and won’t cut it.

The Quick (Gel) Recipe

Mix 3 parts isopropyl alcohol to 1 part aloe vera gel. Add a few drops of tea tree oil to give it a pleasant scent and to align your chakras.

The Better (Spray) Recipe

The aloe mixture gets the job done, but aloe also leaves your skin annoyingly sticky. So, here's a recipe that's less sticky and more potent, based on the mix recommended by the WHO.

Mix 12 fluid ounces of alcohol with 2 teaspoons of glycerol. You can buy jugs of glycerol online, and it's an important ingredient because it keeps the alcohol from drying out your hands. If you can't find glycerol, proceed with the rest of the recipe anyway and just remember to moisturize your hands after applying the sanitizer.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-make-hand-sanitizer#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1

"['Megan Molteni', 'Megan Molten', 'Meghan Herbst']",,Early Remdesivir Data for Covid-19 Is Finally Here,"In late January and early February, as the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 began to spread outside of China, Andre Kalil was spending more and more time inside his office at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, on the phone and emailing with researchers at the National Institutes of Health. With no known treatments or vaccines against the deadly respiratory virus, the NIH was keen to launch a clinical trial of the most promising candidates, starting with remdesivir, a medicine developed by US-based drugmaker Gilead to treat Ebola. The NIH wanted Kalil to lead that trial.

An infectious disease physician, he was a natural choice for two reasons. One, he’d worked on an unusual trial of Ebola treatments during the 2014–15 West African outbreak that created a new model for evaluating experimental drugs during a public health crisis. And two, he had access to UNMC’s Biocontainment Unit, the largest of 10 nationally-designated centers for treating people with the world’s most infectious deadly diseases. Though the US had only a handful of Covid-19 patients at that time, sooner or later there would be more, and Kalil knew they’d probably wind up in Omaha. “We’re one of the few centers in the country that can receive US patients from other countries during an outbreak, so we viewed it as just a matter of time,” he told WIRED in a recent interview.

Sure enough, on February 17, 13 Americans arrived jet-lagged, exhausted, and sick or suspected of having Covid-19. They had just endured a 10-hour evacuation flight from Japan on a chartered cargo jet, and before that, more than two weeks of floating quarantine aboard the doomed Diamond Princess cruise ship.

Just over a week later, three of those cruise ship patients signed up to be the first participants in the federal government’s clinical trial, the first in the US to evaluate experimental Covid-19 treatments. For 10 days, they received a two-hour daily intravenous infusion of a clear liquid that contained either remdesivir—a molecule that impersonates the virus’s genetic building blocks, disrupting its ability to replicate—or a placebo of sterile saltwater solution. They didn't know which one they were getting. Their doctors didn’t know either. But UNMC researchers would carefully collect measurements of how each patient fared. Later, as the disease continued to spread, they would add that information to similar data that would eventually be gathered from more than a thousand other Covid-19 patients at more than 68 hospitals in the US and 21 other countries in Europe and Asia.

This week, the NIH offered the first peek at results from the closely watched study. In a statement released Wednesday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—the NIH branch that is conducting the trial—said preliminary data shows remdesivir speeds up the recovery of some Covid-19 patients. “Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo,” according to the statement.

The finding, though modest, would represent the first treatment shown to improve outcomes in patients infected with the coronavirus, which as of Thursday had sickened 3.2 million people worldwide. At least 1 million of those are in the US, where the official death toll has reached more than 60,000. However, it’s difficult to evaluate the results without full, detailed data about the patients, how sick they were, and any potential side effects, which the NIAID did not provide. That information is expected to be released within days, according to NIAID director Anthony Fauci, who revealed the study’s results during a meeting with reporters Wednesday afternoon at the White House.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/early-remdesivir-data-for-covid-19-is-finally-here#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Garrett M. Graff', 'Garrett M. Graf']",,An Oral History of the Day Everything Changed,"In the end, as history will record, the story that would have been the biggest news on Wednesday, March 11—the story that in normal times might have been the biggest headline of the month—will hardly register in America’s memory: That morning, at 11:06 am, a judge sentenced Hollywood super-producer turned super-predator Harvey Weinstein to 23 years in prison on sexual assault charges.

Yet within 12 hours, the staggering fact that Weinstein—the force behind an entire generation of movie classics from Shakespeare in Love to Pulp Fiction—might very well spend the rest of his life in prison turned out not only not to be the biggest story of the day, it wasn’t even the biggest Hollywood story of the day.

Instead, Wednesday, March 11, the 71st day of 2020, proved to be unlike any other in American history—the pivot point on which weeks of winter unease about the looming novel coronavirus turned in a matter of hours into a sudden, wrenching, nation-altering halt to daily life and routine. Just a day earlier, Americans across much of the country were still going into the office, meeting friends for drinks, and shaking hands in meetings. That morning, the number of coronavirus cases in the US crossed the 1,000 mark, up 10-fold from the prior week. Only 29 Americans had died.

But on that Wednesday, the World Health Organization, which had only begun referring to the virus as Covid-19 a month earlier, declared the disease a global pandemic. Every hour seemed to bring major new developments: On Wall Street, after days of huge up-and-down gyrations, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,465 points and officially entered bear territory; Capitol Hill faced its first confirmed Covid-19 case; the NCAA announced it would play its basketball tournament without fans; and then, in rapid-fire succession that evening, President Trump gave an Oval Office address, announcing a travel ban from Europe, the NBA suspended its season after player Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus, and Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita, posted on Instagram that they too had been diagnosed while in Australia and were recuperating.

By Thursday, the national landscape had been undeniably altered, and Americans were panic-buying toilet paper. A whole new vocabulary—WFH, PPE, flattening the curve, social distancing, self-isolation, Zoom-bombing, and quarantinis—loomed ahead. Epochal events that had occurred just weeks earlier, from the Australian wildfires to President Trump’s impeachment trial to the drama of the Democratic primary, would seem instead to have occurred years ago.

Within a month, thousands would be killed by the virus, as hospitals from New York to Detroit to New Orleans were overwhelmed, and more than 100,000 had been sickened. The economy would slide into a virus-induced coma, and some 17.7 million Americans would lose their jobs over the next month—a number larger than the populations of all but four states. Not even Harvey Weinstein would escape the drama: He tested positive for the virus on March 23.

To capture the moment that everything in American life changed—launching us into an uncertain future of unknown duration—WIRED collected the stories and memories of more than 30 people who lived March 11’s drama first-hand, from the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange to a basketball arena in Dallas to Capitol Hill to the airports of Europe.

I. The Days Before

Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control (2009-2017): By the end of January, I was saying this is either going to be bad or it’s going to be very, very bad. All through February, we were all trying to figure out how bad is this going to be?

Peter Tuchman, stock trader, Quattro Securities: We’ve been on a wild tear for a year. The market has been headline-driven, news-driven, Trump-driven, tweet-driven with moves that are quite aggressive. On February 12 the Dow hit a record high of 29,551. The S&P was at a record high. We had a so-called deal in place with China. All the ducks had been lining themselves up for a massive market rally. The world had not really gauged the reality of the virus yet.

Mark Cuban, owner, Dallas Mavericks: I had followed all the data that was being distributed.

"['Daniel Oberhaus', 'Daniel Oberhau', 'Katie M. Palmer', 'Matt Simon']",,The World Is Still Producing More Oil Than It Needs. Why?,"Something weird happened on the oil market last week. For a few minutes on April 20, the price of a barrel went negative for the first time ever. The unprecedented collapse of prices is linked to the pandemic, which has caused people to stop doing oil-guzzling things like flying and driving. There’s now so much extra petroleum on the market that the world is running out of places to put it. If you’re an oil producer, it seems like the sensible thing to do in this situation would be to … stop producing so much oil.

On Friday, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, the US, and others will begin scaling back their production by nearly 10 million barrels per day. They hope that this will help stabilize prices and take some pressure off of producers and refineries that are scrambling to find a place to store the excess. But the rollback isn’t likely to be enough. Oil producers would have to reduce production by almost three times that amount to match the downturn in demand. So why don’t they?

The WIRED Guide to Climate Change The world is getting warmer, the weather is getting worse. Here's everything you need to know about what humans can do to stop wrecking the planet.

The short answer is because temporarily closing or “shutting in” a well costs money—and potentially lots of money. It’s not just about the foregone revenue, which is less of a concern when prices are dipping into the negative. It’s about what happens when the well is opened back up. “Shutting in a well is not especially difficult,” says Eric van Oort, a petroleum engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. It’s mostly a matter of shutting off a master valve at the surface, much like turning off a faucet. But, he says, “operators are generally reluctant to shut in their wells if they don’t absolutely have to, because they know they’re going to incur some damage on those wells.”

The US has been the largest producer of crude oil in the world for the past two years, and the vast majority is dredged up in Texas and on offshore derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. On land, most of America’s crude is produced from shale reservoirs, which trap the oil in rocks with low permeability. To set it free, companies use a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that opens cracks in rocks deep in the Earth by blasting them with water or gas.

Shut-ins are a normal part of oil production, but they are usually limited to a few wells at a time and mostly undertaken for repairs. Petroleum producers have known for decades that shale wells that have previously been shut in produce less oil when they’re reopened, says John McLennan, an expert in geomechanics at the University of Utah Energy and Geoscience Institute. But the exact cause of the damage is often unclear. McLennan says that one of the most well-supported explanations is water blockage.

A well typically taps into a mixture of oil and water. Both are pumped to the surface, but the water is treated as waste. When a well is shut in, the ratio of oil to water is recalibrated, since there’s no longer a big pipe sucking on the fissures in the rock. Because the rock in shale wells isn’t very permeable, water may accumulate in the fractures. When the well opens up again, it may end up producing more water than oil, because the accumulated H 2 O impedes the movement of oil. Shale wells typically operate on thin profit margins, so even a relatively small loss in productivity could make the well unprofitable.

Van Oort says the amount of time a well is closed doesn’t really affect how much damage the shut-in inflicts on the reservoir. Once the well is closed, the damage is done. If producers have to repeatedly shut the well, the damage can compound over time and reduce productivity even more. “It is always best to leave the well alone once you go to production,” says van Oort.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/the-world-is-still-producing-more-oil-than-it-needs-why#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Arielle Pardes', 'Arielle Parde']",,"Amazon, Instacart, Target Workers Unite for May Day Strike","On Friday, front-line workers from Amazon, Instacart, Shipt, Target, and Whole Foods have organized to walk out of their jobs together over demands that their companies provide better pay, benefits, and protections. Some of these workers deliver packages; others deliver groceries. Some stock shelves in warehouses, and others ring up customers in stores. Some of them are classified as independent contractors and others as employees. But all of them claim that the companies they work for have denied them basic protections on the job, even as the pandemic poses greater risks to their health and safety. Despite being classified as essential workers in a crisis, they say, their companies treat them as disposable.

Worker dissatisfaction at these companies has been simmering for years. But the pandemic, which has placed these workers under a spotlight, has raised the temperature significantly. Friday’s strike follows individual walk-outs at Amazon warehouses and Whole Foods stores, as well as protests from delivery workers at Instacart and Shipt. It marks the first time workers from all those companies will strike together as one united force with similar demands.

“An Amazon warehouse worker has different rights and protections than an Instacart shopper,” says Vanessa Bain, an Instacart worker who helped plan Friday’s strike. “But at the end of the day, our organizing should be interconnected. We're all in this struggle as workers who are deemed essential, on the front lines, and we’re struggling against giants.”

Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, and Target, which owns Shipt, are among the nation’s largest retailers. Instacart, too, is valued at billions of dollars. Each company has hundreds of thousands of workers across the country; Amazon and Instacart are hiring thousands more, as shutdowns dramatically increased demand. In press releases and statements, all three companies say they take workers’ safety seriously and have spent millions of dollars to support their workforces during the pandemic.

The protesters share many of the same demands, including increased hazard pay, expanded sick-leave policies, and stricter cleaning and social distancing measures to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus in facilities. Companies announced new measures as the number of Covid-19 cases in the US grew, and with it safety concerns. Amazon and Target both raised wages by $2 an hour, expanded sick leave, and increased cleaning at facilities. But some of the policies have been temporary: Amazon, for example, provided unlimited unpaid leave for workers but only until the end of April. And the workers who have spoken out—along with groups with names like Target Workers Unite, Amazonians United, Whole Worker, and Gig Workers Collective—say their companies should do more.

That workers are now looking outside their own company isn’t surprising, some experts say. “The problem isn’t unique to Instacart, or Target, or Whole Foods. The problem is across essential work,” says Benjamin Sachs, a labor law expert at Harvard Law School.

Even several groups of workers banding together may not be able to effectively withhold labor enough to force companies to meet their demands. Organizers say their bases number in the tens of thousands, but that represents a minuscule part of the overall workforce of these companies. And even reaching that level of participation may be difficult. One Instacart worker, who was asked by WIRED about Friday’s strike, said she’d never heard it was happening; another said she had seen shoppers talking about it on Reddit but had no intention of participating, “because Instacart won’t even blink.”

Instacart workers already staged one nationwide strike on March 30, which Bain says had thousands of participants. Instacart says that had “absolutely no impact” on its operations; in fact, it reported 40 percent more workers picking up groceries that day than one week before. The company did announce it would supply its shoppers with safety gear, but dozens of workers have since complained about the availability and quality of those products. Organizers say their other demands, like hazard pay and extended sick leave, have gone unmet.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-instacart-target-coronavirus-may-day-strike#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Louryn Strampe', 'Louryn Stramp']",,How to Cut Your Hair at Home,"So, your hair is getting long, and all of the salons are closed because of a global pandemic. It may be time to cut your own hair at home. Stylists will advise you to avoid getting too overzealous with your scissors, but sometimes you're left with no choice. Cutting your hair is more complicated than it looks, and this guide is not one-size-fits-all, but it should help you at least figure out the basics on where to start.

Updated April 24: We've refreshed some of the links in this guide.

If you buy something using the links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission. Here’s how this works. You can also support our reporting and reviewing by purchasing a 1-year print + digital WIRED subscription for $5 (Discounted).

Do You Really Need a Cut?

There are plenty of ways to change your look without being extreme or doing something you may regret. As my hairstylist Angela Layng says, ""We never make our best hair decisions when we're stressed."" Additionally, the stylists I interviewed emphasized the fact that home haircuts can go awry quickly. Just take a look at the videos of people trying to give themselves bangs.

Before you make any permanent changes to your hair, consider some temporary ones. Now is a great time to grow out your hair. Is your hair fried from repetitive heat damage? Break the heat-styling cycle and your mane will be looking its best in no time. If you've played with the idea of changing your part, go through the transition while you're at home.

You can also fake a hair transformation. Create a faux bob with the help of some bobby pins. If your hair is long enough to put into a ponytail, you can use creative styling to create fake bangs with no scissors required. Try covering your head in barrettes or learn to fishtail braid. Experiment away!

Brushing your hair is also an underrated way to give your tresses some TLC, according to hairstylist and salon owner Kenzie Veurink. For curly-haired folks, you can achieve a similar treatment by using a wide-toothed comb or your fingers. The goal is to stimulate your scalp and work its natural oils down the length of your hair. It'll help your strands stay shiny and strong, and there's some evidence that scalp stimulation encourages faster hair growth.

Now that you may have more free time, you could slather on a hair treatment mask first thing in the morning and wash it off before you go to bed. You might even have the components for a DIY hair mask in your kitchen already. Ingredients such as mayonnaise, eggs, honey, and apple cider vinegar are great for your hair. Mix 'em up in a bowl and cover your hair, then let the mask sit for as long as you'd like before rinsing.

Gear You May Need

Quality scissors: A sharp edge helps keep your hair from fluffing out at the ends or moving around too much while you trim. Consider using precision scissors or placing an order for hair-cutting shears, which are razor-sharp and should be handled with care.

Hair clippers for short hair: Hair clippers are in short supply right now, but this is a good clipper kit if you can manage to snag it—and this is a good alternative. This self-cutting trimmer might help if you plan to cut your own hair without any help.

Keep These Tips in Mind

Have someone else help: Cutting your own hair in the mirror can be tricky. If you can, get someone to help you trim evenly, or decide when enough is enough. If you have to fly solo, use multiple mirrors and take breaks to check up on how you're looking.

Consider texture and length: A DIY haircut is hard enough for folks with long, thick, straight, healthy hair. If your hair is curly, short, or especially textured, mistakes will be easier to spot, so use caution.

Start small: Have you ever used a magnifying mirror to tweeze your eyebrows, only to step back and realize you've gone too far? The same principle applies to your hair. You can always take off more, but there's no going back once you've snipped away too much. It may help to step away for a few hours before you reassess where you’re at.

Avoid horizontal lines: It might have looked badass when Disney's Mulan did it, but you don't want to hack your hair off in a big horizontal line. Hold your scissors straight up and down the length of your hair, rather than across it, and snip away just a little bit at a time. This is especially important if you're working on bangs. Horizontal lines are sometimes necessary for removing length, but snipping vertically keeps your hair from becoming too blunt—a telltale sign of at-home haircuts. If you've cut horizontally, make sure to follow it up with vertical snips to thin out the ends and make the cut look more natural. If you aren't feeling dextrous enough to cut vertically, try holding your scissors diagonally.

How to Trim Your Hair

Be conservative. This is likely your first time, so trim your hair—don't try to restyle it entirely. If in doubt, you can always wait and book an appointment with your favorite stylist once shelter-in-place orders are lifted. Below is our best trimming advice, along with some links to tutorials that will help you, depending on your hair's length and texture.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-cut-your-own-hair-at-home#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Will Knight', 'Will Knigh']",,The Cubicle Is Back. Blame (or Thank) the Coronavirus,"The cubicle is making a comeback.

As thousands of companies contemplate restarting operations, executives are weighing how best to reconfigure workspaces that have, by and large, been designed to minimize cost and foster the face-to-face interactions that can spread the deadly coronavirus.

Some companies are looking at high-tech approaches to enforce social distancing and track interactions, with location-monitoring apps and badges, artificial intelligence surveillance cameras, and high-tech health checks. Other innovations will be simpler: stickers to enforce 6 feet of distance between coworkers; staggered shifts that allow for more spacing; more regular cleanings; and of course oodles of hand sanitizer.

But one of the most important innovations may turn out to be cardboard or plastic dividers that turn open-plan offices into something more reminiscent of the 1980s.

“You’re gonna see a lot of plexiglass,” says Michael Boonshoft, a spokesperson for Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate company that has drawn up guidelines for reopening office spaces. “Having that divider will make people feel safer. That shield between desks will be really important.”

Cushman & Wakefield is importing innovations from offices it operates in China, where it has helped more than a million people return to work. Besides temperature checkpoints, masks, sanitizer, and wipes, the guidelines recommend rearranging desks and meeting room seating to ensure social distancing, having workers use disposable desk covers, and installing dividers between workspaces.

“Companies aren't going to have a ton of time and money to create a whole new office concept in a month,” Boonshoft says. “So these are quick- and inexpensive-to-implement ideas.”

“You’re gonna see a lot of plexiglass.” Michael Boonshoft, Cushman & Wakefield

WeWork, the on-demand office space company, has kept some sites open to support essential businesses during the pandemic. Last week the company shared with members a blueprint for maintaining safety at its locations. Measures include rules on social distancing at shared desks and in meeting rooms and kitchens, regular cleaning, and modifications of air-conditioning systems to reduce recirculation that might spread the virus. But a representative says the company is considering other steps, including installing partitions in what had been open office spaces.

“Partitions are really hot right now,” says Ben Waber, president and cofounder of Humanyze, a company that analyzes digital and physical communications between office workers to gauge productivity and collaboration.

Humanyze is working with clients including Panasonic in Japan to determine how to redesign office layouts to minimize potentially dangerous interactions without cutting off communication. The company measures workers’ movements inside buildings using anonymous data from smart ID badges.

Waber says a key challenge will be balancing new safety measures with opportunities for productive interactions: “At the end of the day, the only reason to be in an office is to collaborate.”

Cubicles appeared in US offices in the 1960s as a way to encourage personalization, movement, and meaningful interactions among office workers, according to Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace, by Nikil Saval. Robert Propst, a designer at Herman Miller, came up with the idea for a modular, low-cost, cubicle-filled space as an antidote to the rows of typing desks that were common at the time.

“Partitions are really hot right now.” Ben Waber, president, Humanyze

Over the following decades, however, the cubicle ironically became associated with regimented, monotonous, and depersonalized office life. It fell out of favor early in this century, as Silicon Valley startups embraced open offices to encourage collaboration, and companies elsewhere mimicked the idea.

Some businesses are eyeing more high-tech tools for ensuring social distancing and preventing the spread of the virus.

Smart cameras may be one way to guard against unsafe worker behavior. SmartVid.io, which makes AI surveillance systems for identifying unsafe situations at construction sites without identifying individuals, last month developed software to warn managers when workers fail to maintain safe distances from each other. CEO Josh Kanner says it is working on an upgrade that will detect whether workers are wearing masks.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/cubicle-is-back-blame-thank-coronavirus#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Angela Watercutter', 'Angela Watercutte', 'Emma Grey Ellis']",,An AI Meme Generator Gives Us the Absurdist Art We All Need,"Drake advocating a coup. Distracted Boyfriend casting his gaze toward carbs. Leonardo DiCaprio suggesting it’s time to have a dick. Truly none of these things make sense. Yet as people worldwide are fully in their second month of coronavirus quarantine (or should be), they’re all oddly hilarious notions. Perhaps it’s stir-craziness, but the images burped out by the AI meme generator—a recently added feature of the site Imgflip—make a random kind of sense. At a time when nothing is rational or orderly (somehow, large gatherings of people are threatening herd immunity, know what I mean?), jokes created by machine learning aren’t what anyone would call “good” or “hilarious,” but they do reflect a certain kind of fractured collective psyche. Why not enjoy them? If AI can’t stop this pandemic, the least it can do is provide some absurdist art.

Titled, wryly, This Meme Does Not Exist, the tool is very simple: Select from one of dozens of popular memes and let the generator do the rest. Pick Dave Chappelle’s Tyrone Biggums’ Y’all Got Any More of That meme and it’ll spit out something about emails. Choose Yoda and he’ll come back with a joke about your mom. The actual words themselves come from a corpus of some 100 million captions submitted to Imgflip’s meme generator. To keep things simple, the site trained its AI using just the 48 most popular memes and 20,000 captions per meme, for 960,000 captions total. “However, since we are building a generational model there will be one training example for each character in the caption, totaling ~45,000,000 training examples,” Imgflip founder Dylan Wenzlau wrote in a very thorough blog post describing the tool’s creation. “Character-level generation rather than word-level was chosen here because memes tend to use spelling and grammar … uh … creatively.” Put another way, the machine doesn’t generate each meme word by word but character by character. Hence really complex—and at times bizarre—word combinations. Memes used creative syntax to begin with; having it fed into an AI and regenerated makes it look like something put through Google Translate too many times.

It also looks like something akin to art. There’s an almost collage-like aspect to the images the meme generator is producing, like it’s feeding the internet’s twisted humor back to it as a form of commentary. The computer didn’t just look at DiCaprio and think, “Hm, something about dicks … ?” It came up with that based on things others had already said. Same with Distracted Boyfriend and bread. There’s something inherently surrealist about it. The project’s name invokes other AI image experiments like This Person Does Not Exist or This Cat Does Not Exist, but it also seems to echo ""This is not a pipe."" The early 20th century had Magritte; the early 21st century has memes. The treachery of images remains the same.

That is likely why the AI meme generator has taken off. Wenzlau posted his first paper on the project a little over a year ago, and researchers at Stanford have been using machine learning to make memes for nearly two years. Yet it’s only been recently, perhaps even in the last 24 hours, that social media has latched onto these memes. Such are the ways of the internet; memes that fall in the woods don’t get LOLs, memes that land on Twitter do.

That said, this time feels most ripe for this kind of humor. Amid coronavirus’s virulent march, lockdowns, protests against lockdowns, and daily White House briefings that feel disconnected from the experiences of everyday Americans, everything feels absurdist. There is senseless death, and even more senseless politicking around it. People are turning to social media in droves to find connection and maybe relief. Some laughs would help, but the web’s collective sense of humor feels tapped out. Joking about a pandemic can be a much needed release, but who wants to crack wise? Maybe it’s time to let the computers take this one.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-meme-generator-coronavirus#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Lauren Smiley', 'Lauren Smile', 'Meghan Herbst']",,27 Days in Tokyo Bay: What Happened on the Diamond Princess,"Before dawn on the 5th of February, Captain Gennaro Arma sipped espresso in his tidy office, wondering how bad the news would be. He wore a crisp black uniform with shiny brass buttons and lifted the tiny cup with fingers swathed in cheap latex gloves. The passengers on the Diamond Princess were mostly asleep, and Arma, not long awake himself, brooded over the possibilities. He hoped for a Return to Normal: He would thunder up the engines and glide the Diamond from its anchored stillness out in Tokyo Bay into the port of Yokohama. Passengers would trudge down the gangway, Samsonites rumbling, a little befuddled by their brush with calamity but on their way. Then there was That Other Option, less clear and more ominous. Hearing a knock—there they are—Arma strapped on a surgeon's mask, opened the door, and greeted two Japanese health officers who strode in, also wearing gloves and masks, ready to deliver the verdict.

Two weeks earlier, on January 20, Arma had sailed the Diamond southwest from Yokohama for a 14-day cruise to China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, then back to Japan. Three days into the voyage, news reports arrived that China had shut down all travel from and within Wuhan, an inland city of 11 million, in an attempt to squelch a new coronavirus. Then, in the predawn hours of February 2, Princess Cruises' vice president of maritime operations had awoken Arma with preliminary information that a passenger in his eighties who had left the ship in Hong Kong eight days earlier had since tested positive for the same virus. The captain was told to speed back early from Okinawa to Tokyo Bay, so that passengers and crew could be screened. Ferrying out to meet the ship late on February 3, health workers boarded and spent that night and the next day walking cabin to cabin, asking if people were feverish or coughing, taking temperatures and swabbing throats.

Now the health officers were back with the first set of test results: The coronavirus hadn't disembarked with the elderly man in Hong Kong. Ten of the 31 results at that point were also positive. Nine passengers. One food worker.

While they spoke, the captain's thoughts went to the 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members. Those 10 people probably had roommates. How far had it spread?

Arma had spent more than 25 years at sea. Just five months earlier, in these same waters, he had faced his most arduous trial yet, white-knuckling the Diamond's helm against Typhoon Faxai. He had held the bow straight into 100-mph winds, lest they catch the cruise liner's massive flank and fling it around like a toy boat in a Jacuzzi. He accepted the sea's hierarchy—“You can't beat Mother Nature, but you can come to a compromise”—so all night he negotiated, gunning the engines and thrusters to keep the 115,875-ton behemoth in place, the nautical version of running on a treadmill. You didn't hear about a Princess cruise ship slamming into a cargo vessel or capsizing last September, because he succeeded.

“We got through Faxai. We'll get through this,” a staff captain told Arma upon hearing of the virus aboard the ship. Arma preferred Faxai. This new coronavirus wasn't something he knew how to navigate.

The legal authority for the ship's safety had shifted to the Japanese government. Those officials, in turn, had pondered a real-life version of the trolley problem: The ship was carrying 3,711 people, any one of whom could be harboring a potentially fatal disease to which no one had immunity. No option was good. A ham-handed disembarkation risked unleashing the virus within Japan, which at that point had only 20 known cases and was hosting the Summer Olympics in just five months' time. Send passengers to their home countries without ensuring they were healthy and Japan would be blamed for spreading the contagion. Yet the last choice—a quarantine, albeit in a glamorous prison—presented a danger, even an inevitability, of sickening many on board. And given that 60 percent of the cruisegoers were 60 years or older, with weaker immune systems, an infection could mean death.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/diamond-princess-coronavirus-covid-19-tokyo-bay#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Louise Matsakis', 'Louise Matsaki']",,How to Use TikTok: Tips for New Users,"It’s been more than three years since the lip-syncing app Musical.ly, now known as TikTok, first became popular among tweens and teens. The social network has since spread far beyond Generation Z: TikTok has been downloaded over 1 billion times, including 96 million in the United States, according to estimates from the research firm Sensor Tower. It’s also owned by the Chinese company Bytedance, now considered one of the most valuable startups in the world. The app itself revolves around sharing 15-second videoclips, which are set to music often licensed from artists and record labels.

TikTok is now beloved not only by lip-syncing 14-year-olds, but also by comedians, athletes, and, yes, brands. Major corporations like Coca-Cola, Nike, ABC, and Google have run advertising campaigns on TikTok. Even Khloé Kardashian has been paid to post sponsored content on the platform. But the app isn’t just home to ads: TikTok is also ground zero for some of the internet’s most popular memes.

You can be forgiven if you feel like you don’t understand TikTok. The app is fast-paced and chaotic, combining elements of Spotify, Snapchat, Vine, and Twitch into a single social network. Here’s what you need to know to get started, from TikTok “Challenges” to Coins and Original sounds.

Getting Started: Set Up Your Account

The first thing you’ll need is a pair of headphones. There’s just no way to enjoy TikTok with the sound off. After you download the app, you can immediately start browsing videos. But in order to post any yourself, you’ll need to sign up for an account.

You can make an account using your email, your phone number, or a third-party platform like Facebook. The app automatically assigns you a username. If you sign up for TikTok with your phone number, the app will generate a generic username such as user1234567. Using an email address generates a more personalized ID (although that may present a privacy issue for users).

To change your username, tap the icon in the right bottom corner that looks like a person’s upper body. Then hit Edit Profile. Here, you can change it to something more unique, as well as add a bio, picture, and Profile Video.

By default, TikTok accounts are public, meaning anyone can see your profile and view the videos you post. To adjust these privacy settings, tap the three dots in the top right corner of your profile.

Navigating TikTok

Now that your profile is ready to go, it’s time to watch some TikToks. The app is divided into two main feeds. The default is For You, an algorithmically generated stream of videos akin to Instagram’s Explore page. Swipe left and you’ll find the other, Following, which features uploads from people you choose to follow. TikTok is like a never-ending variety show; it’s pure entertainment. Follow creators who make you laugh, like @k.chh, who posts hilarious skits, or opt instead for adorable accounts like @cute_puppies12, which posts the tiniest dogs I’ve ever seen.

You’ll notice to the right of every TikTok video a series of icons. The first will take you to the profile of the user who posted it. Then there’s a heart, which functions just like hearts, or likes, on Instagram. Next are comments, then a right-pointing arrow for sharing individual TikToks to other platforms. Click the arrow if you want to copy the link to a specific TikTok, for example, to share it on iMessage. (One note for left-handers: You might find TikTok hard to use, at least at first, since it’s often right-oriented.)",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-tik-tok#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Emma Grey Ellis', 'Emma Grey Elli', 'Meghan Herbst']",,Covid-19 Is Killing Black People Unequally—Don't Be Surprised,"Ala Stanford is a doctor, but right now her office is a parking lot, a street corner, the sidewalk outside of a Philadelphia Baptist church. Stanford leads a mobile unit of doctors who are bringing free Covid-19 testing to the neighborhoods in Philadelphia that are being hit hardest by the virus: underserved black communities. Across the United States, black Americans are contracting and dying of Covid-19 at wildly disproportionate rates, and in some areas, they aren’t being tested for the virus nearly as frequently as their white peers, either.

Stanford and her cohort, who call themselves the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, are dedicated to combating the much discussed but poorly addressed crisis where it lives, armed only with nasal swabs, educational materials, and personal protective equipment. They’re able to pay for those necessities because this week they successfully raised more than $100,000 on GoFundMe. Money for lifesaving medical treatment during a pandemic is coming not from government coffers but from the whims and wallets of the internet.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that several racial minority groups account for a disproportionate number of the Covid-19 cases and fatalities in the United States, but the black community in particular is suffering. In Wisconsin, a state that is only 6 percent black, black people account for about half of its Covid-19 deaths. In Chicago, black people account for 70 percent of deaths due to Covid-19 but make up only 30 percent of its population. In Richmond, Virginia, all but one of the people who have died of Covid-19 were black. “I’ll tell you the first thing I said when I saw the disparities in fatality rates,” says Louis Penner, a professor emeritus at Wayne State University who studies racial disparities in health care. “I said, ‘People are surprised?’”

Anybody who is paying attention knows that the gulf between the health statistics of white and black Americans has existed for decades, or, really, centuries. Covid-19 is just the latest manifestation of an old and ugly trend. The explanation for it is at once simple—racism—and incredibly complex. Structural inequalities have kept black Americans significantly poorer than their white counterparts, and economic disparity creates health disparities, especially during a pandemic. Black people (and other minority populations) tend to live in more polluted, more densely populated areas, have more people per household, and are overrepresented in settings where people are unable to effectively social distance, like prisons and homeless shelters. They disproportionately work jobs currently considered essential, yet also are far less likely to have paid sick leave, enough savings to take time off, or a grocery store nearby enough to stock up easily.

Many of these factors, from living in food deserts to lacking health insurance, add up to mean that black communities also suffer at higher rates from acute and chronic medical conditions. “My colleagues knew this was going to be an issue months ago, as soon as we started hearing that preexisting conditions like obesity, diabetes, chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases are all risk factors for dying of Covid-19,” Penner says.

On top of creating the black community’s ongoing health crisis, systemic racism is also a barrier to treatment. According to Shervin Assari, a health inequality researcher at Charles R. Drew University, one of the only historically black medical schools in the nation, while white people prefer to get their health information from medical providers and the media, black people rate health-related information they receive from family members and churches more highly. The reason for this isn’t poor education (although it’s another structurally unequal factor), it’s due to longstanding and justified mistrust. “We found that racial prejudice amongst physicians affects how they interact with black patients,” Penner says. “Even in very short, highly structured interactions between physicians and patients, black patients pick up on this and react to it.”",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-coronavirus-racial-disparities#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Jerrine Tan', 'Jerrine Ta', 'Meghan Herbst']",,What Singapore Can Tell the World About Personal Liberty,"In mid-January I returned to the US from a visit home to Singapore, where people were already worried about the novel coronavirus spreading in China. All through February, it was bizarre to observe business as usual in the US. Western media reports mostly critiqued the authoritarian lockdown measures implemented by China—the same measures that have since been adopted in various forms across the world as it became clear that containment was key to managing the crisis. Complacency and an unwillingness to call for severe restrictions to mobility early on in the name of not violating individual liberty doomed the US to its ongoing crisis.

Donald Trump’s refusal to take the virus seriously and the delays in lockdown were myopic, prideful, and willfully ignorant. Western liberal democracies will not emerge from this crisis with much—or any—moral or political clout. The US and UK all but bungled their early responses. Instead, the world will look to places that have handled this crisis well, or at least better.

WIRED OPINION ABOUT Jerrine Tan was born and raised in Singapore. She has a PhD in English from Brown University and currently teaches Global Anglophone Literature in the English department at Mount Holyoke College. Her writing has appeared in Asian American Writers Workshop and is forthcoming in Modern Fiction Studies.

In the early stages of the outbreak, Singapore was roundly lauded for its prompt and efficient response, ensuring a quick flattening of the curve. But if we are to learn lessons from Singapore, they should be clear-eyed, understanding how and why it was able to respond in the ways it did, not only in a time of crisis but also because of how it operated before.

The Singapore government, synonymous with the PAP (People's Action Party), managed the first wave of infections well. Its system of contact-tracing is world-class. Masks were rationed and distributed. As the second wave of imported infections started rolling in, hotels served as dedicated quarantine rooms for returning Singaporeans, which ensured safe and proper physical distancing while propping up the ailing hotel industry and saving jobs.

But managing a crisis well does not mean that the problematic aspects of a government go away. In fact, effective crisis management can be aided by these characteristics. In The Economist, Kishore Mahbubani chalks the success of China, South Korea, and Singapore up to “quality of governance and cultural confidence of their societies.” But this claim is reductive. The PAP is notorious for draconian censorship laws, harsh retaliation against dissenters, and the suppression of other political parties. In the past month, the appeal to repeal Section 377A, a relic of colonial law criminalizing sex between two men, was dismissed. A local activist was jailed for unfavorably comparing Singapore’s judiciary system to Malaysia’s. These events largely passed unremarked due to the onslaught of Covid-19 news. On the back of Wired, CNN, and Time praising Singapore’s response in early March, the Singapore government made moves which political commentators have read as suggesting the possibility of snap elections, including announcing the new electoral boundaries on March 13, as if to leverage goodwill in the midst of crisis to solidify political power. But should the government call for elections soon, not only will opposition parties be at a distinct disadvantage, the health of the population will also be put at risk.

Is freedom and a robust democracy the price to pay for effective crisis management?

In late March, as flights from the US to Singapore got canceled for the indefinite future, I found myself grappling for the first time in my life with the existential and psychic pain of not being able to return home if I wanted to. Remaining in a country that quickly surged to have the most cases in the world, I began to wonder about the price I was willing to pay to ensure that the Singapore government acted in a way that would secure the safety of my family. As a child, I used to lie awake at night in fear, imagining the deaths of my loved ones, and brokering silent deals with god. Give my parents one more year of life and I swear I’ll do my homework every day. As the Covid-19 pandemic worsened across the US, and Singapore braced to face a second wave, I found myself sinking into helpless worry and again making wishful deals in the dark—this time not with god but with my government: Get Singapore through this. If my parents stay healthy until I can get home, I swear I’ll never speak ill of the government again. In a state of emergency, more than a few of us will find ourselves cutting deals with god, the devil, or the government alike.

For now, Singapore has extended its “circuit breaker” period till June 1. The euphemistic term denotes stringent lockdown rules: closure of schools and non-essential businesses, mandatory mask-wearing (or risk heavy fines), among other measures. Elections, like everything else, will have to wait.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/what-singapore-can-tell-the-world-about-personal-liberty#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Aarian Marshall', 'Aarian Marshal']",,Elon Musk Says Tesla Stock Is ‘Too High’—and It Quickly Falls,"He’s at it again.

Launching a Friday morning tweet-tear, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote, “Tesla stock price is too high imo [in my opinion].” Ask, believe, receive: The electric-car maker’s stock price immediately began to dip, finishing the day down 10 percent.

It’s curious for any executive to say the company’s stock is too high. It’s especially curious for Musk—even though, in just the past 48 hours, the billionaire has tweeted (then deleted) an image of a cursing unicorn topped by American flags and a pledge to rid himself of nearly all material possessions. That’s because Musk has been sued by US securities regulators for posting about his business before. To settle that case, he agreed to have tweets about Tesla reviewed by the company’s lawyers.

The tweet topped off a wild week for the automaker, which announced a surprise profit in the first three months of the year despite Covid-19-related closures at its assembly plants in Shanghai and California. But Musk received more attention for his remarks—launched on Twitter and continued on a call with analysts Wednesday—complaining that shelter-in-place orders were “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights” and “fascist.”

A CEO calling the company’s stock price overvalued could hurt the enterprise and its investors in the short term. “Very few CEOs have ever said this—or anything close,” says John Coffee, who directs the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School.

Still, Coffee says he’s not sure Musk could get in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the missive. “It is hard to impossible to call this fraudulent, and it is a statement of opinion,” he says, the sort of thing a company executive is permitted to say. “I tend to doubt that the SEC will choose to take on this one.”

Others aren’t as sure. Because Musk knows more about his company—material, nonpublic information—than its investors, it's possible the CEO is using Twitter to manipulate the price of Tesla stock and lead investors to buy or sell, says Stephen Diamond, a professor of corporate finance and securities regulation at the Santa Clara University School of Law. It’s a real problem for Musk if the tweet is misleading, he says, and could lead to more scrutiny from regulators. It’s an even real-er problem if the tweet can be linked with any sort of trading activity, including stock buybacks. Musk could be accused of insider trading.

“The problem is that this is Elon Musk.” Stephen Diamond, Santa Clara University School of Law

The tweet is especially risky for Musk and company because of their prior clashes with the SEC. Both Musk and Tesla paid $20 million apiece in September 2018 to settle with the SEC over a tweet in which the CEO said he had the funding to take Tesla private—a statement that was untrue. As part of that settlement, Musk agreed to have any communications that could contain information “material” to Tesla reviewed by a company lawyer, including tweets.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-stock-too-high-falls#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Julie Muncy', 'Julie Munc']",,The Last of Us Part II Gets a Leak—and a New Release Date,"Welcome once again to Replay, WIRED's weekly guide to everything going on in the world of videogames. This week, we've got leaks, announcements, and, uh, Elon Musk. Let's check it out.

The Last of Us Part II Gets Both a New Release Date and a Major Leak

Busy week for those keeping up with news out of Naughty Dog, developer of The Last of Us Part II. First off, the game has a new release date: June 19. (That's later than the original release date of May 29, but probably a relief for fans, considering it appeared to be delayed indefinitely just a few weeks ago.) News of the on-sale day came hand-in-hand with word of a major leak of a development build of the game, setting off a series of rumors and debates over who did the leak, why, and whether or not it might have been justified. The initial rumor was that a disgruntled employee had leaked the game to protest poor labor conditions, though Sony has gone on the record as of Friday to say that the leaker in question, according to its investigation, wasn't affiliated with Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.

The leak itself, featuring major spoilers about the game's narrative, surfaced last weekend, with footage from a late-in-development build of the game. It included gameplay as well as a number of important cutscenes. So if you're not interested in getting spoiled for this particular title, you might want to tread carefully.

The Next Assassin's Creed Will Meet Again in Valhalla

It's not super clear what connects the games in the Assassin's Creed franchise at this point, what with the broader narrative and aesthetic connections becoming thinner and thinner as time goes on. They all have, uh, murder? Some jumping? Anyway, the new one has vikings! As announced this week, the next game in the series is Assassin's Creed Valhalla, set in the ninth century and starring everyone's favorite raidy boys and girls of the northern hemisphere. In this one, like the last one, you can play as a dude or a lady, and this time you're a member of a Viking clan who, probably, decides to kill a variety of villains based on a personal sense of justice that occasionally overlaps with a broad science fiction-al metaplot that, at this point, we could not even begin to explain to you. It looks fun. It's coming at the end of the year.

Elon Musk Brings Deus Ex Into His Anti-Stay-at-Home Thing

So, here's the deal: Elon Musk, that dude who has a car company and is having a baby with Grimes, recently took to Twitter to heavily protest America's stay-at-home orders, tweeting ""FREE AMERICA NOW"" and applauding the decision of Texas' governor to allow a limited reopening of the state starting today. In the process of doing so, he also changed his Twitter icon to that of JC Denton, the protagonist of the 2000 videogame Deus Ex. Denton, a cyborg murder machine genius, is caught up in a plot that sees him opposing a massively rich corporate icon and a corrupt government supporting him in creating a stratified, information-controlled totalitarian world run by corporations.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/last-of-us-2-new-release-date#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
