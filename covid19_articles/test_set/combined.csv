['Bob Price'],2020-05-05,REPORT: Texas Hair Salon Owner Gets Jail Sentence for Violating Coronavirus Lockdown Order,"A Dallas hair salon owner who defied a Coronavirus lockdown order will spend seven days in jail, according to a local news report. The salon owner refused to keep her business closed and defied a direct cease and desist order from Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins in April.

“Shelley Luther, a Dallas hair salon owner who opened in violation of the governor’s executive order, sentenced to 7 days in jail for civil / criminal contempt of court and fined $7,000,” CBSDFW reported Andrea Lucia tweeted on Tuesday.

Lucia later corrected her tweet and reported the fine to be $500 per day — $3,500 so far and growing.

Correction: The amount of the fine is $3500 and growing. $500/ day for the 7 days the salon was open. $500/ per day for every day it remains open through Friday, when the governor has said all salons may open. — Andrea Lucia (@CBS11Andrea) May 5, 2020

The move to fine and incarcerate Luther comes on the same day that Governor Greg Abbott announced that hair salons will be able to re-open on Friday, May 8.

In April, Salon Á la Mode owner Shelley Luther re-opened her hair salon in defiance of orders by the county that she remained closed, Breitbart Texas reported on April 25. “Every owner of every salon should use their own best judgement when to reopen,” the Texas governor said during a press conference that occurred at the same time the fine and jail sentence were announced in Dallas.

At this time, it is not clear what judge issued the contempt order that includes the seven-day jail sentence and the fine pf $500 per day.

Luther told WFAA ABC8 she is “prepared to take on whatever it is that comes with” re-opening her business. She said she had to choose between paying her lease or her mortgage this month because of the stay-at-home order.

“I don’t want to cause any problems, but when you’re out of money someone has to stand up and say that they’re not helping us by not letting us work,” she explained. Luther is unable to perform any of her three jobs — musician, makeup artist, and hairstylist — because of the lockdown of the county.

Now, according to the local CBS affiliate’s reporter, “whatever it is that comes with” is a seven-day jail term for contempt and a fine of $$500 per day.

“I’m behind on my mortgage,” she explained at the time. “I know a lot of my stylists haven’t paid their mortgage. It’s either come in and make money to be able to feed your family or stay home and freak out.”

“Obviously I don’t want anyone to get sick and I don’t want the virus to spread,” Luther continued. “It will be one of the safer places for people to go rather than going to Walmart or Home Depot.”

“I will not pay the fine,” the defiant salon owner told reporters in April.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-05,Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hospitalized for 'Benign Gallbladder Condition',"The Supreme Court announced Tuesday evening that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, has undergone a non-surgical procedure for acute cholecystitis, a minor gallbladder condition.

Ginsburg received treatment at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, on Tuesday and is now resting comfortably. She is scheduled to participate in Wednesday’s arguments via teleconference, said the high court.

“Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent non-surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis, a benign gallbladder condition, this afternoon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland,” the Supreme Court said in a statement. “Following oral arguments on Monday, the Justice underwent outpatient tests at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., that confirmed she was suffering from a gallstone that had migrated to her cystic duct, blocking it and causing an infection. The Justice is resting comfortably and plans to participate in the oral argument teleconference tomorrow morning remotely from the hospital. She expects to stay in the hospital for a day or two.”

The announcement comes after Ginsburg was hospitalized at Johns Hopkins Hospital for two nights with the chills and a fever in late November.

Ginsburg — often referred to as the “notorious RBG” in liberal circles — has experienced a string of health issues over the years. The justice broke three of her ribs in a fall in November 2018 and underwent lung cancer surgery in December 2018. She received radiation treatment for pancreatic cancer in August.

Ginsburg also survived colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009.

Despite ongoing speculation of her possible retirement, Ginsburg signaled last summer that she has no plans to step down from the bench.

President Jimmy Carter appointed Ginsburg to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1980 and was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/supreme-court-ruth-bader-ginsburg-hospitalized-for-benign-gallbladder-condition/
['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,"Politico Founder: I Want a Joe Biden ‘Coronation’, Even If He Is Guilty of Sexual Assault","Martin Tolchin, a founder of Politico and former New York Times correspondent in Washington, DC, published a letter to the editor of the Times Tuesday calling for a Joe Biden “coronation” regardless of claims of sexual assault.

The letter came in response to a recent Times editorial calling for the Democratic National Committee to investigate claims by Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer, who claims Biden assaulted her in 1993.

Tolchin wrote that he did not want Reade’s claims investigated — or anything else about Biden — because all he wanted was to see Trump defeated in November.

The letter, in full, follows (original emphasis):

I totally disagree with this editorial. I don’t want an investigation. I want a coronation of Joe Biden. Would he make a great president? Unlikely. Would he make a good president? Good enough. Would he make a better president than the present occupant? Absolutely. I don’t want justice, whatever that may be. I want a win, the removal of Donald Trump from office, and Mr. Biden is our best chance. Suppose an investigation reveals damaging information concerning his relationship with Tara Reade or something else, and Mr. Biden loses the nomination to Senator Bernie Sanders or someone else with a minimal chance of defeating Mr. Trump. Should we really risk the possibility? Martin Tolchin

Alexandria, Va.

The writer is a former member of The Times’s Washington bureau and a founder of Politico.

The Democratic National Committee rejected the Times‘ suggestion, calling it “absurd on its face.”

Critics noted that Tolchin’s attitude confirmed public suspicion of the Beltway media as hopelessly partisan and uninterested in the truth.

David Martosko, a White House correspondent for the Daily Mail, tweeted that Tolchin’s letter was “Exhibit A demonstrating why less than 1/3 of Americans trust the news media.”

['Pam Key'],2020-05-05,Pelosi: Biden Sexual Assault Allegation Is a ‘Closed Issue’,"Tuesday on MSNBC’s “The Beat,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) dismissed the sexual assault allegations against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden as a closed issue.

Host Melber said, “I do want to play Joe Biden’s response. As viewers know, he has publicly addressed this allegation. Let’s take a listen.”

In a clip, Biden said, “It is not true. I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened, and it didn’t. It never happened. I’m asking the secretary of the Senate today to identify whether any such document exists. If it does, make it public.”

Melber said, “Joe Biden speaking out just days ago on that allegation of a sexual assault. Now that he has given that answer, do you view this as a closed issue, or what is your response?”

Pelosi said, “Well, it is for me. I have said I am proud to support Joe Biden for president. I believe him when he says it didn’t happen. But I also believe when he says let them look into the records. And that’s what they should do. But I’m not going to answer this question again. I will just say I have every confidence that Joe Biden will be a great president of the United States. Not only because of the person of integrity that he is but the person of vision that he is for just some of the things you talked about, about health care for all Americans, about job security, about the kitchen table issues that he is so familiar with in his own family when his father lost his own job. Joe Biden is Joe. He brings those values and his personal experience to a vision for America that is about fairness and not trickle-down economics, but bubble up from that kitchen table, from working families in our country.”

['John Nolte'],2020-05-05,"Nolte: Biden, Media, Feminists Resurrect Clinton Playbook to Destroy Reade","What’s happening to Tara Reade at the hands of the corporate media, feminists, and Joe Biden is a disheartening return to the 1990s, to the infamous Bill Clinton era.

Reade has come forward with one of the most credible sexual assault allegations we have seen in a very long time. She alleges that in 1993, while working in his Senate office, then Sen. Biden (D-DE) sexually harassed her, sexually assaulted her, and then fired her in retaliation for filing a harassment complaint.

Tara Reade is Joe Biden’s eighth accuser.

Tara Reade has five witnesses who corroborate she told them about the alleged assault at or near the time.

If her claim is eventually debunked, Tara Reade risked prison last month by filing a formal criminal complaint against Biden.

We now have video of Tara Reade’s anguished mother calling into a 1993 edition of CNN’s Larry King Live to ask advice about her daughter’s problems with a “prominent senator.”

Tara Reade has challenged investigative reporters to dig into her story.

Finally, Tara Reade is calling for Biden to make his Senate papers available in the hopes her harassment complaint will be found.

Tara Reade is behaving like a woman with nothing to hide.

Joe Biden denies the allegation, but is behaving like a man with everything to hide.

And in an effort to allow Biden to hide straight through to the November election, and in an effort to personally destroy Tara Reade, Biden, feminists, and the media have decided to resurrect the Clinton-era Playbook.

Those of us old enough to remember the 1990s, the way in which the media and feminists circled the wagons to protect Clinton, are very familiar with these cynical tactics.

For eight long years, we watched as the media smeared Paula Jones (Clinton would eventually settle his sexual harassment lawsuit with her for more than she originally asked) as trailer trash, attacked lifelong Democrat Kathleen Willey as a gold-digging widow, attacked Monica Lewinsky as a crazed stalker, and ignored Juanita Broaddrick’s credible rape allegation.

When these women refused to be ignored, they were smeared by a media determined to protect a Democrat. When they demanded justice, the Clinton Machine sent out its surrogates to lie on Clinton’s behalf. When these women went public, so-called feminists came right out and said they didn’t care.

And now it’s happening again. Despite Reade’s increasing credibility, despite #MeToo-era feminists and the media assuring us the hideous Clinton era would never return, along with the Biden Machine, they’re all using the exact same playbook to destroy Tara Reade.

To begin with, just like Bill Clinton did, Biden is refusing to be transparent. In this case, he will not allow anyone to look at his Senate papers (not even a trusted judge).

Further, Biden has still not given his version for Reade leaving his Senate office in 1993. An intern who worked under Reade says Reade abruptly disappeared one day. Biden has still not explained his version of why she left, nor have the media asked him for his version.

Just like Bill Clinton, Biden is spreading lies about Reade. Biden’s campaign came up with a series of talking points to discredit Reade, and all three of those talking points have been exposed as lies. Even the far-left New York Times was forced to admit one was a lie.

Just like Bill Clinton, Biden’s surrogates are threatening, menacing, and publicly bullying Reade while the media either ignore or encourage this behavior.

Worse still, just like Bill Clinton, Biden is sending high-profile women, like Stacey Abrams, out into the media with those talking points, which means he’s sending women out to lie on his behalf.

As far as the feminists… Just like the 90s, here we go again…

Feminist attorney Lisa Bloom says she believes Biden sexually assaulted Reade but still supports the man she believes committed a sexual assault.

Leading #MeToo figure Alyssa Milano has twisted herself into a pretzel attempting to justify her staggering leap from “believe all women” to I still “admire” and “support” Joe Biden.

The Washington Post’s Ruth Marcus, Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times, and the Nation’s Joan Walsh — all feminists, all #MeToo champions — have, just like their 90s predecessors, willingly sacrificed their credibility to protect Biden.

High-profile feminists like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sens. Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) are openly siding with Biden over Reade, openly dismissing her story as bogus, even as Biden spreads lies and refuses transparency.

And in the most 1990s of 1990 flashbacks, Hillary Clinton, who has a 30 year history of protecting alleged predators, stands with Biden.

Today’s Hollywood feminists, those who were the most strident about #NeverAgain and #MeToo, have eagerly joined the campaign to destroy Reade or to dismiss Biden’s disturbing history — including Meghan McCain and Whoopi Goldberg.

And so, just like the now-disgraced National Organization for Women (NOW) did in the 90s, the #MeToo movement has been sacrificed, has gone down in the flames of its own silent complicity to protect a Democrat.

The media have been equally reprehensible.

In a desperately dishonest effort this weekend to kill Reade’s credibility forever, the Associated Press straight-up lied about Reade changing her story about the harassment complaint she filed, when the record proves the exact opposite is true.

We also learned the AP had the Reade story all the way back in 2019 but refused to report it at the time, and only finally reported it this weekend with that deceptive smear attempt.

The far-left New York Times scrubbed Biden’s disturbing and well-documented history of inappropriately touching women from what it sold as an exhaustive investigation into Reade’s allegation, when it was nothing of the sort.

Over the weekend, the Times even went so far as to demand the media stop investigating the story and allow — no joke — the Democrat National Committee to handle the investigation.

Male media staffers who pose as superhero journalists eager to protect victimized women, people like CNN’s Jake Tapper and NBC’s Chuck Todd, had the opportunity to make big news by asking Biden about the allegation during an interview; they chose instead to protect him by not bringing it up.

Female staffers who pose as superhero media feminists, like MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace and Andrea Martin, are wrist-flicking a credible assault allegation to protect their guy.

Yes, just like the Clinton era, and after we were assured that sickening spectacle never be allowed to repeat itself, we once again have feminists, Democrats, and the media gleefully victimizing another credible victim.

P.S. My prediction is this… In about 20 years we’ll discover Tara Reade told the truth, and as a result, the corrupt media will engage in a cycle of hand-wringing and soul searching and promises that they will never again allow a credible victim to be demeaned and dismissed…

And that promise will last right up until the moment a high-profile Democrat is hit with a credible allegation.

['David Ng'],2020-05-05,Michael Moore: Earth Will Take ‘Revenge’ on Mankind for ‘Trying to Choke It to F**king Death’,"Documentary filmmaker and left-wing activist Michael Moore is predicting a doomsday environmental scenario for the planet that will dwarf the coronavirus pandemic. Who’s to blame? Humans, of course.

In Tuesday’s episode of his podcast, the Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker framed the coronavirus as Mother Earth’s revenge against mankind. “Take this moment, take this virus, as earth’s slap in our collective face,” he said, adding that the Chinese coronavirus is nature “trying to tell our species to back off, slow down, and change your ways.”

On today’s Rumble podcast I lay it all out—my radical environmental manifesto: We are in a planetary emergency and no amount of collaborating with the enemy – capitalism/profit motive/greed – will save us. We need a new way, new leadership. Time to fight. https://t.co/Ow2h7OevUs — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) May 5, 2020

Michael Moore warned that Earth has the power to wipe out mankind in a way that will surpass the current global crisis.

“You do understand that this planet can remove all of us with the snap of its fingers,” Moore said. “If you think COVID-19 has been a bummer, trust me, you literally can’t imagine just how awful Earth’s revenge will be against us for trying to choke it to fucking death.”

Moore added that humans lie at the root of the problem.

“We are in a serious multi-level planetary emergency and that emergency involves climate. water, food, top soil, over consumption, species that have gone missing, our ocean life — what’s left of it — and humans. Mostly humans. And our human, non-sensical, greed-induced behavior and systems,” he said.

Moore said that the environmental movement has failed to produce meaningful results.

“We are very grateful to our environmental leaders for years of brilliant research,” he said. “Except, it hasn’t worked. We are worse off since the first Earth Day 50 years ago. Not better off, worse off. I don’t even need to tell you that. You already know.”

“We can no longer solar panel and windmill our way out of this disaster,” he added.

Moore’s disenchantment with the environmental movement arose last month while promoting the new documentary Planet of the Humans, which highlights the failures of the mainstream environmentalists while also assigning blame to corporate interests as well as solar and wind energy companies and electric car manufacturers.

“All the things we set out to do… you and I both know we have not done that,” Moore said.

The filmmaker noted that 90 percent of large fish in the wild, like halibut, are now gone. “We ate them,” he said.

He added many mammals in the wild have also disappeared. “We eat them too.”

['Amy Furr'],2020-05-05,Oregon Salon Owner to Reopen Business Despite Stay Home Order,"A salon owner is planning to reopen her business Tuesday in Salem, Oregon, despite Gov. Kate Brown’s stay-at-home orders.

When Glamour Salon owner Lindsey Graham closed her business weeks ago due to the coronavirus lockdown, she began to miss her clients and fellow stylists, according to KGW 8.

“We have incredibly deep relationships where we share everything with each other and we laugh with each other,” she said.

However, Graham also misses having an income and explained that not being able to provide for her husband and three kids has been difficult.

“We’re not entirely sure where next month’s funds are gonna come from,” she explained.

To provide for her family, the salon owner decided to open her business again even though Brown recently extended Oregon’s state of emergency until July 6.

“The new executive order gives the governor the legal authority to maintain the orders she’s issued thus far — including the stay-home order, a moratorium on residential and commercial evictions and other financial stimulus measures — and issue new ones as she sees fit,” according to the Oregonian.

Despite the extension, Graham said she wanted to lead by example.

“People are now looking up to me to be kind of the leader in this. You know, how’s this going to go for you? Are you going to be able to open your doors and provide for your family, and if that goes well maybe I can open my doors and provide for my family,” she said.

Monday, a representative from the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health agency paid her a visit and warned that she could face fines if she reopened her business.

“That’s an ending for us,” Graham said, adding, “That can’t happen.”

Still, the salon owner resolved to open her doors regardless of the potential backlash.

“The government has backed us into a corner and driven fear into us so that we can’t even take a stand and earn our living. It’s completely unconstitutional and it’s devastating and it’s immoral,” she stated.

Three of her four stylists were scheduled to work on Tuesday. They will wear masks and gloves and only one client will be allowed inside the salon at a time, according to Graham.

Monday, Facebook users expressed their opinions about the owner’s decision to reopen.

“Your [sic] not special, and you are not essential, OHA needs to step in and start fining all and shutting down, pure disrespect for your fellow humans,” one person commented.

The case of the order of Catholic nuns who care for the elderly sick and poor is among the handful the Supreme Court has decided to hear telephonically during the coronavirus outbreak.

The Little Sisters are hoping the high Court will finally end their seven-year legal battle against the Obama-era mandate that requires them to provide free contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees through health insurance plans.

Former Obama-era Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – an abortion activist – and bureaucrats in her department inserted the mandate into Obamacare. Following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the Obama administration devised “accommodations” that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be footing the bill for the federal government’s mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures. In reality, the faith groups were being asked to passively approve of the contraceptives.

Left-wing groups such as Planned Parenthood claim women should obtain free birth control and that the Trump administration is forcing women to pay for their own birth control when they choose to have sex. The Obama administration itself, however, actually exempted from its own rule at least 25 million Americans – including large corporations such as Chevron, Exxon, Visa, and Pepsi Bottling, as well as the U.S. military and large cities like New York City – through various exemption allowances, with little pushback from the left.

In May 2016, in the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court unanimously decided to send back to the lower courts the case of the Little Sisters, in effect ordering the government not to fine the Sisters for noncompliance with the HHS mandate and for not informing the government that the mandate is in conflict with their beliefs.

One year later, President Donald Trump issued the first executive order ever to defend religious liberty. In the order, Trump directed HHS to develop rules for rights of conscience regarding abortion that would protect faith groups such as the Little Sisters.

The Trump administration announced its new rule the following October that would protect the nuns and other religious non-profits from being coerced by the federal government to provide services in their healthcare plans that violate their faith beliefs.

The rule provided full protection for Americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions and acknowledged that the contraceptive mandate concerns serious issues of moral concern, including those involving human life.

However, the following December, a federal judge in Pennsylvania blocked the Trump administration’s rule that exempted employers with religious or moral objections to the Obamacare mandate.

U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone, an Obama appointee, said the state was “likely to suffer serious and irreparable harm” if she did not order a preliminary injunction.

Beetlestone’s order followed a lawsuit filed by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who posted on Twitter the ruling was a “critical victory for millions of women and families and for the rule of law”:

The Federalist Society will also host a Courthouse Steps Teleforum Wednesday at 3:30 pm ET on the Supreme Court case Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania.

Becket states at issue in the Little Sisters’ case are:

Whether a litigant who is directly protected by an administrative rule and has been allowed to intervene to defend it lacks standing to appeal a decision invalidating the rule if the litigant is also protected by an injunction from a different court; and Whether the federal government lawfully exempted religious objectors from the regulatory requirement to provide health plans that include contraceptive coverage.

In a statement sent to Breitbart News, Ashley McGuire, senior fellow with The Catholic Association, noted the Little Sisters are currently fighting two battles:

They not only must fight to keep the elderly poor they care for safe and alive during the coronavirus pandemic, they also have to fight extremist ideologues who think nuns should provide abortion pills in their healthcare plans too. The Supreme Court already told the government to accommodate the nuns’ conscience rights and the president issued an executive order ensuring that employers cannot be forced to violate their religious beliefs.

“Nevertheless, attorneys general like Xavier Becerra and Josh Shapiro just won’t stop harassing these women and keeping them from their life-saving work on behalf our nation’s most vulnerable,” McGuire added.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/little-sisters-of-the-poor-return-to-u-s-supreme-court-to-defend-religious-freedom/
['John Hayward'],2020-05-05,India Offers Land Pool Twice the Size of Luxembourg to Companies,"Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that India is “developing a land pool nearly double the size of Luxembourg to lure businesses moving out of China.”

The land pool is not one contiguous area, but a total of 461,589 hectares of industrial property that will be offered for speedy lease at good prices to businesses that wish to relocate out of China after the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Bloomberg, India’s plans for poaching foreign firms from China are still being fleshed out, but one of the most urgent priorities was signaling to corporate buyers that India’s normally slow and confusing process for acquiring land and construction permits would be greatly streamlined. No less of a global business behemoth than Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Aramco has been thwarted from building a $44 billion refinery in India because it could not cut through a web of red tape to buy the land it needed.

Bloomberg’s anonymous source – officials from the relevant ministries declined to comment on the record – said India is looking at offering more land from its special economic zones (SEZ) to foreign buyers or renters because those areas already have “robust infrastructure in place.” The SEZs were always intended to lure foreign business so, presumably, this would mean making them larger and acting quickly to extend their infrastructure into adjacent areas.

American, Japanese, and South Korean companies were reportedly among those most interested in hearing India’s offers. The Bloomberg piece did not delve into exactly how India is marketing its locations to companies currently located in China, or what incentives will be developed specifically to persuade firms to move from China to India.

Like most other countries battling the Wuhan virus epidemic, India took a huge hit to its economic growth and employment. Contrary to the emphasis placed on bringing in foreign business clients by Bloomberg’s source, the Economic Times of India on Monday reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “fiscally constrained” administration is thinking about “reverting to a greater inward orientation,” stressing national self-reliance over global interdependence.

The Economic Times noted the contradiction between this ethos and the big push to woo foreign business away from China and suggested the Indian government should focus on ceding back the extraordinary powers it claimed during the pandemic, leave the private sector “free to rejuvenate production,” and perhaps use foreign investment captured from China to improve India’s national infrastructure for the benefit of both overseas tenants and local businesses.

The question of how likely foreign firms are to decamp from China, seeking new locations in India or elsewhere, is hotly debated. In March, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) suggested Beijing was up against a ticking clock to restore the confidence of foreign investors, lest they become a “hollow economy” after a post-pandemic exodus.

A bitter note in the SCMP’s report was that China’s most attractive feature for foreign industries, in addition to cheap labor, is the haven it provides from environmentalist hassles. China has very lax pollution rules, and Western activist groups have absolutely zero interest in pestering Beijing or its clients about them. India might not be able to offer quite the same level of indulgence.

Forbes reviewed data in April that showed American firms were already pulling out of China after the trade war, and the process accelerated during the pandemic.

“The main beneficiaries of this are the smaller southeast Asian nations, led by Vietnam. And thanks to the passing of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, Mexico, for all its problems with drug cartels, has become a favorite spot for sourcing,” Forbes noted. The same data might have inspired India to make a stronger play for industries pulling out of China.

At roughly the same time, Reuters argued that most American firms did not have short-term plans to leave China, because the logistics of moving were so uncertain and the worldwide economic depression left international corporations with less money to pay for heavy relocation costs. Also, China moved very aggressively in April to send the message that its workforce and infrastructure would return to normal performance much faster than its competitors.

“Our survey results show that companies are considering adjustments to their business strategy, but there is no mass exodus as a result of COVID-19,” declared American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai president Ker Gibbs, adding that over the longer term, the coronavirus crisis added “a new and unwelcome dimension to the conversation about decoupling.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/05/report-india-offers-land-pool-twice-size-luxembourg-companies-fleeing-china/
['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-05,WATCH: Korean Baseball Returns with Socially Distant First Pitch,"Baseball has returned to South Korea, but it certainly did not start in a way that anyone would recognize.

The first day of baseball in the Korean league began with a tradition that most Americans would recognize, the first pitch. Though, that’s where the similarities would end, as the kid selected to make the first pitch walked to home plate in a bubble.

Watch:

Nice of the hitter to take a mock swing at the kid in the bubble just before he got to home plate.

The scene would have seemed odd at any other point in world history, but not so much in our current pandemic predicament. Of course, people will take sports in any form from any country nowadays. ESPN is broadcasting six Korean baseball league games a week after the Scott Van Pelt Show, just to give American fans some much needed sports relief.

['Sean Moran'],2020-05-05,Rubio: Ratcliffe Would Be an 'Excellent' Director of National Intelligence,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday that Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) would be an “excellent” Director of National Intelligence (DNI).

The Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing on Ratcliffe’s qualifications to become the next DNI Tuesday. If confirmed to the position, he would lead the country’s 17 intelligence agencies.

During the nomination hearing, Ratcliffe promised to serve as a nonpartisan aide to the president.

“Let me be very clear: Regardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,” he said on Tuesday.

“Anyone’s views on what they want the intelligence to be will never impact the intelligence that I deliver — never,” he added. “I won’t shade intelligence for anyone.”

Rubio released a statement after the hearing, saying that Ratcliffe would serve as a great fit for the nation’s leading intelligence director.

He said in a statement:

Rep. Ratcliffe understands his top responsibility is to make sure the wide array of intelligence agencies are sharing information across lines, coordinating capabilities, and are all working in the furtherance of the same strategic aim of the 21st century. I think he would be an excellent Director of National of Intelligence, and I look forward to supporting his nomination.

Ratcliffe received praise from other members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

“He answered everything, and I think he did a very successful job at one, verifying that he’s more than capable of this job, and two will serve in an independent capacity,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC), told reporters after the hearing.

“[U.S. intelligence officials] deserve, and the country needs, the certainty of a permanent, Senate-confirmed director of national intelligence,” Burr added.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), a member of Senate GOP leadership, said that the DNI position has “gone vacant for too long.”

Breitbart News reported on Tuesday that Ratcliffe had earned high praise from former White House officials such as Andy Surabian and Tony Sayegh.

Donald Trump Jr., President Trump’s eldest son, told Breitbart News:

Congressman Ratcliffe has the experience to do this job at the highest level, and most importantly his judgment has proven to be impeccable. His many years of public service show that he is a patriot who will always put his country first and stand tall for the American people. This is a no-brainer confirmation for the Senate.

Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official said: Congressman Ratcliffe has proven through his many years of public service that he has the right judgment, temperament, and experience to make an excellent head of ODNI. He should be confirmed by the Senate as swiftly as possible.”

Tony Sayegh, a senior Trump administration official who served in both the Treasury Department and the White House, told Breitbart News, “Our nation deserves a man of John Ratcliffe’s integrity, experience, and professionalism to lead our intelligence community during these precarious times. “President Trump picked the exact right man for the exact right moment,” Sayegh added.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-05,"Harvard Law Prof: Coronavirus Is an Excuse to Dump Free Speech, Property Rights from Constitution","Harvard Law Professor Adrian Vermeule suggests using the Chinese virus pandemic as an excuse to establish a new interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, implementing Marxist policies that do away with concepts such as “free speech ideology” and “property rights.”

Adrian Vermeule, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, recently wrote a piece for the Atlantic in which he argues that traditional interpretations of the U.S. constitution have “now outlived its utility,” and that it is now time for the government to take a more centralized role in people’s lives.

Vermeule argues that “circumstances have now changed” due to the Chinese virus pandemic, and that it is now possible to imagine “moral” constitutionalism, which he says is not “enslaved to the original meaning of the Constitution,” and is also “liberated” from the narrative of “relentless expansion of individualistic autonomy.”

The professor is advocating for a new interpretation of the U.S. constitution, which he refers to as “common-good constitutionalism.”

“Such an approach,” wrote Vermeule, “should be based on the principles that government helps direct persons, associations, and society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in the interest of attaining the common good is entirely legitimate.”

Vermeule also scrutinizes “the libertarian assumptions central to free-speech law and free-speech ideology,” which he says is “forbidden to judge the quality and moral worth of public speech,” and therefore, should “fall under the ax.”

The law professor even goes as far as stating that “property rights and economic rights will also have to go,” because they “bar the state from enforcing duties of community and solidarity in the use and distribution of resources.”

Vermeule claims that this “global pandemic” makes for the perfect opportunity to implement such strategies that grow government, insisting that “it has become clear that a just governing order must have ample power to cope with large-scale crises of public health and well-being.”

The professor also noted that when he says the government should get involved in “health,” he is referring to that “in many senses, not only literal and physical but also metaphorical and social.”

Vermeule even acknowledges that “the central aim of the constitutional order is to promote good rule, not to ‘protect liberty’ as an end in itself,” and that one common-good principle will be “that no constitutional right to refuse vaccination exists.”

“Constitutional law will define in broad terms the authority of the state to protect the public’s health and well-being, protecting the weak from pandemics and scourges of many kinds,” wrote Vermeule.

The professor even goes on to admit that implementing such principles would require overriding “selfish” claims of individuals to private rights, and that his interpretation of constitutional law means that “rulers” should be afforded a “broad scope.”

Vermeule insists that “these principles include respect for the authority of rule and of rulers,” the “respect for the legitimate roles of public bodies and associations at all levels of government and society,” and “a candid willingness to ‘legislate morality,'” among other concepts.

In January, Vermeule’s colleague, chemistry chairman Charles Lieber, was charged with fraud over his private financial relationship with the Chinese government. Lieber was paid millions of dollars by the Chinese government to work on “collaborative projects” between Harvard and the Chinese government.

This week, Republicans in the House of Representatives announced that they have launched an investigation into China’s influence on American universities and colleges.

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-05,Dr. Birx Questions Accuracy of IHME Model Predicting More Deaths,"Coronavirus Task Force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx on Tuesday questioned the accuracy of the updated Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington (IHME) model for coronavirus deaths.

“I think that particular model is very sensitive to actual any changes in the mortality and very much utilizes that data,” she said during an interview with reporters on Tuesday.

The release of the updated model projects an increase in coronavirus deaths to 74,073 in the United States by August 4, fueling a narrative that the virus was not going away as quickly as the president has predicted.

Birx said she looked forward to an IHME model adjustment in another week, pointing out that their prediction for deaths expected on Tuesday was already higher than the actual data.

She also said that the model likely failed to note the continued mitigation parameters in both phases of the reopening plan.

“I’m not sure all of the mitigation parameters were taken into account,” she said.

President Donald Trump also expressed skepticism about the IHME model on Tuesday, noting their failure to include metrics for social distancing.

“Look, models have been very inaccurate, I’ve seen models that are very inaccurate,” Trump said at the White House when asked about the updated predictions.

Birx also said that the IHME model likely had not taken into account the task force guidelines for asking seniors and more vulnerable communities to continue sheltering in place in both phases of the reopening America plan.

“That’s a consistent element that needs to be present,” she said. “That was put there very intentionally to make sure that in opening up America, that very clear statement, that we were protecting the vulnerable we felt that was absolutely essential.”

She urged states not to skip different phases of the reopening plan, and continue social mitigation protocols to help stop the spread of the virus.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/dr-deborah-birx-questions-accuracy-of-ihme-coronavirus-model-predicting-more-deaths/
['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,"South African Police Arrest Family, Including Breastfeeding Mom, While Feeding the Poor During Coronavirus","A South African man and his fiancée were arrested with their 21-month-old daughter Monday while feeding poor residents of a community near Cape Town after their toddler ran onto a beach and he ran to retrieve her.

According to Cape Talk 567 radio, Liam Bulgen of Muizenberg and his family had prepared food for residents of Vrygrond, a poor neighborhood near the False Bay coast, and were walking legally on a promenade near the beach when their toddler ran onto the sand. He retrieved the child — and they were then confronted by police.

Though the charge was initially unclear, Bulgen said, police indicated that they were being arrested for violating local regulations for the coronavirus lockdown by setting foot on the beach.

Bulgen told Cape Talk that “one officer told me I am stupid for having my child out in public because she could die,” and that the senior officer on the scene was not wearing a face mask.

Bulgen and his fiancée were taken separately to the police station. She was allegedly pushed into a police van while breastfeeding the toddler to calm her down.

South Africans initially rallied around President Cyril Ramaphosa in the early days of the country’s ongoing lockdown, but are now chafing at restrictions on movement — and overly zealous enforcement.

“We are not criminals. We did nothing wrong. And we were mistreated,” Bulgen said. He added that police prevented the couple from handing their toddler over to another relative during their confinement.

The social media accounts for Joe Biden released the new campaign ad which heckles President Trump for stating that he believes he has been “treated worse” than other U.S. presidents.

“Over 1 million cases of COVID-19. Almost 70,000 dead. What is upsetting President Trump? Tough questions from the press,” said Biden’s Twitter account, which included the video. “Cry me a river, Mr. President.”

Watch below:

The campaign ad includes Justin Timberlake’s 2002 hit song and is accompanied by edited video clips from President Trump’s Lincoln Memorial Fox town hall.

“I am greeted with a hostile press, the likes of which no president has ever seen,” the president can be heard saying in the video.

While Biden’s social media accounts insinuate that President Trump should be prioritizing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, the president has been busy conducting daily press briefings regarding his administration’s work in combating the Wuhan virus — and other daily updates — for months.

Meanwhile, many on the left — in Hollywood and in media — have been advocating for news organizations to cease the broadcasting of the daily sought-after briefings and block Americans’ ability to hear from the president on the issue.

The left-wing CNN and MSNBC have already cut away from President Trump’s briefings, refusing to air the full press conferences, with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow going as far as to argue that “all of us should stop broadcasting it, honestly.”

“It’s going to cost lives,” added Maddow of the president’s daily briefings on the Wuhan coronavirus.

The president visited a Honeywell manufacturing plant and spoke about the ongoing fight against the coronavirus.

Owner Jorge Rivas thanked the president and said he was very proud of what he was doing to help the country.

“I think we represent a lot of the Latino community that is very proud of the job that you are doing,” Rivas said. “And I think most of us, all of us Latinos are going to vote for you.”

Rivas said that he and his wife Betty appreciated his support.

His wife wore a denim Keep America Great vest and showed it off to the crowd before addressing them in Spanish and concluded by saying “Latinos Love Trump!”

President Trump thanked the owners and said that he had personally paid for the meals for 150 health care workers in an area health care center.

“They’re sending Donald Trump the bill,” Trump said. “I can’t write it off to the government, cause they wouldn’t like that, but we’re paying it.”

Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist of Imperial College, London resigned from his role as a senior scientific advisor to the British government Tuesday evening.

He became known as professor lockdown after his alarming data modelling predicted huge casualties for the populations of the United Kingdom and the United States unless they enacted severe curbs on individual freedoms to lock the nations down. While the moves were criticised by senior legal figures as approaching a police state, Professor Ferguson’s advice was nevertheless heeded by the government in March.

While Professor Ferguson frequently appeared in the media to defend his work and to tell the public not to break the lockdown rules, he was himself spectacularly breaking them in secret, according to a report in Britain’s Daily Telegraph, which claims the hard-line scientist was meeting his married lover.

The paper names Antonia Staats, a married mother, who was quarantined with her family at a separate address to the professor. Breaching the terms of the lockdown — as enforced by police — she travelled to Ferguson’s own home on at least two occasions, the paper claims.

Staats, who is identified as a “left-wing activist”, was said to be in an “open marriage”, The Telegraph claimed. Posts on Staat’s public Facebook page show strong left-wing themes, including paid activism as an employee of a campaign group, encouraging tactical voting in the last general election to oppose the Conservative party, and hard green activism.

Admitting his error, Professor Ferguson told the paper:

“I accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in Sage [the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]. “I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. “I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The Government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.”

The professor is not the first government scientific figure forced to resign after taking a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do posture to the general public. Breitbart London reported in April when the chief scientific advisor for Scotland resigned her position after ordering citizens to obey the lockdown measures while breaking them herself in public.

While Britons have been ordered to stay in their normal residences and not travel to their country homes in hope of enjoying a more comfortable and less cramped lockdown period, Dr Catherine Calderwood was photographed travelling to her country home. She received a police warning after being exposed in a national newspaper and resigned shortly afterwards.

Rubin advised against the placement of politics as one’s primary paradigm of experience.

“I think we have to try to separate every little [political] belief we have from how we are as humans,” Rubin urged. “I don’t want people to be permanently political. Right now — especially because of the coronavirus, I’m sure you’re seeing this on Twitter — the people that are obsessed with politics all the time, that can’t write about anything other than politics, or their whole worldview is consumed by politics, in many ways are the most miserable people, because politics is not a winning game.”

Rubin continued, “Politics is about controlling people, ultimately, and if you come from a … more libertarian perspective, where your goal is not to control everybody, I think there’s a way to be happier in life through that, because you want to free people, not control them. But if you’re if your goal is to control people — if you get off on controlling people — you will only be endlessly miserable.”

LISTEN:

“Conservatives seem to be much happier, right now, where leftists who are sort of drunk on steroid-laden secularism or something have nothing to believe in anymore,” stated Rubin. “So when the government’s run by a guy that they don’t like — or that they think is Hitler, as absurd as it is — they think the world is just coming to an end at all times. I don’t view politics as everything. It’s important, but it’s not everything.” Pollak asked why conservatives are more reserved than leftists in terms of political sermonizing. “Why is it that people on the left feel comfortable confronting people on the right about their views, but you almost never … have conservatives trying to get liberals to change their views in ordinary settings?” inquired Pollak. “Why is it okay for people on the left to do it, but people on the right feel like they’re overstepping a boundary if they do the same?” Rubin responded, “There’s a very clear answer to this … Broadly speaking, if you’re on the right, you sort of have some live and let live, and you realize that politics isn’t everything, and you kind of want to live your life and hope that other people will live their lives. The reason for that is because people on the right basically believe in individual rights, meaning that if you’re a conservative or you’re a libertarian, you basically believe that everyone in the country should have the same rights, regardless of skin color, race, the rest of it. That’s a bedrock principle.” Left-wing rejection of separation between realms of government and private life drives the ideology’s adherents to view all things through the lens of politics, explained Rubin. “On the left, it’s different. There is no bedrock principle other than, ‘Government should do this,'” Rubin remarked. Leftists are “always in that race to out-government themselves,” he added. Rubin went on, “Their business is everyone’s business, and everyone else’s business is their business,” noting that left-wing people are more likely to try to “jam their worldview down your throat” than those on the right. “Their whole existential being is wrapped up in how they feel, and I think that’s why they’re constantly pushing this stuff on people,” concluded Rubin, describing leftists’ worldview as myopically political. “It’s the totality of how they view the world. They don’t view it through some other lens.”

“Conservatives seem to be much happier, right now, where leftists who are sort of drunk on steroid-laden secularism or something have nothing to believe in anymore,” stated Rubin. “So when the government’s run by a guy that they don’t like — or that they think is Hitler, as absurd as it is — they think the world is just coming to an end at all times. I don’t view politics as everything. It’s important, but it’s not everything.” Pollak asked why conservatives are more reserved than leftists in terms of political sermonizing. “Why is it that people on the left feel comfortable confronting people on the right about their views, but you almost never … have conservatives trying to get liberals to change their views in ordinary settings?” inquired Pollak. “Why is it okay for people on the left to do it, but people on the right feel like they’re overstepping a boundary if they do the same?” Rubin responded, “There’s a very clear answer to this … Broadly speaking, if you’re on the right, you sort of have some live and let live, and you realize that politics isn’t everything, and you kind of want to live your life and hope that other people will live their lives. The reason for that is because people on the right basically believe in individual rights, meaning that if you’re a conservative or you’re a libertarian, you basically believe that everyone in the country should have the same rights, regardless of skin color, race, the rest of it. That’s a bedrock principle.” Left-wing rejection of separation between realms of government and private life drives the ideology’s adherents to view all things through the lens of politics, explained Rubin. “On the left, it’s different. There is no bedrock principle other than, ‘Government should do this,'” Rubin remarked. Leftists are “always in that race to out-government themselves,” he added. Rubin went on, “Their business is everyone’s business, and everyone else’s business is their business,” noting that left-wing people are more likely to try to “jam their worldview down your throat” than those on the right. “Their whole existential being is wrapped up in how they feel, and I think that’s why they’re constantly pushing this stuff on people,” concluded Rubin, describing leftists’ worldview as myopically political. “It’s the totality of how they view the world. They don’t view it through some other lens.”

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-05,Donald Trump Mocks 'Moonface' George Conway for Never Trump Ad,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday ridiculed a group of Never Trump Republicans who put together an ad criticizing his response to the Chinese coronavirus.

“I don’t know what Kellyanne did to her deranged loser of a husband, Moonface, but it must have been really bad,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his advisor Kellyanne Conway’s husband George Conway who is helping lead the “Lincoln Project” — a Never Trump Republican effort to get President Trump out of the White House in 2020.

The group created an ad called “Mourning in America” telling Americans that “more than 60,000 Americans have died from a deadly virus that Donald Trump ignored,” and that America is “weaker and sicker and poorer.”

The ad has over three million views on Twitter

Trump mocked the team for copying Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America” concept saying it was proof they had no imagination.

“You see, these loser types don’t care about 252 new Federal Judges, two great Supreme Court Justices, a rebuilt military, a protected 2nd Amendment, biggest EVER Tax & Regulation cuts, and much more,” he wrote, referring to his record as president.

Trump ridiculed other Republicans involved with the project as “losers,” such as former John Kasich adviser John Weaver, political strategist Rick Wilson who lost with a third party candidate Evan “McMuffin” McMullin, and former John McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt.

The president noted they were all part of the loser political class who lost to former President Barack Obama and were also beaten badly by his campaign in 2016.

“I didn’t use any of them because they don’t know how to win, and their so-called Lincoln Project is a disgrace to Honest Abe,” Trump said.

Trump suggested Abraham Lincoln himself would be proud of his Republican achievements as president.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-05,Pakistani Government Finds Mosques Violating Coronavirus Rules,"A report produced on Tuesday by the city government of Rawalpindi, in the Pakistani province of Punjab, found that most of the city’s 250 most sensitive mosques were ignoring guidelines provided for safe worship during the coronavirus pandemic.

The violations were especially widespread during Taraweeh, an additional prayer service observed during the Ramadan holiday.

Pakistan’s Dawn explained that mosques and imambargahs (halls where Shiite Muslim clerics can address women and children who are normally forbidden in mosques) were examined for their coronavirus vulnerability and rated on a scale of A, B, or C to determine how strict their pandemic precautions should be.

The regional police performed an audit and found that while masks and hand sanitizer were generally used as directed, many of the mosques allowed elderly people and children into risky, crowded areas where they were not supposed to go, and some did not provide clean floors for prayers.

Some of the riskiest mosques were not designed in a manner that facilitated good virus control measures, offering crowded and poorly-illuminated public spaces or inadequate space for worshipers to wait until they were admitted to the prayer halls.

Another security directive required metal detectors for all visitors, but 43 of the 250 mosques covered in the study did not provide them.

Pakistan has a running problem with hardline Muslim imams defying anti-pandemic measures and encouraging their followers to follow suit.

The New York Times noted in late April that “most clerics complied with the shutdown when it was announced, but some of the most influential ones immediately called on worshipers to attend Friday prayers in even greater numbers,” and those worshipers “attacked police officers who tried to get in their way.”

Clerical resistance to coronavirus precautions grew as Ramadan approached until a group of influential Muslim leaders wrote a letter demanding an exemption for mosques from the national pandemic lockdown, with the wrath of Allah and his faithful threatened against officials who refused to comply.

The Pakistani government submitted to this demand, allowing mosques to remain open for Ramadan provided they follow a list of 20 social distancing rules, which the Rawalpindi auditors said many of their mosques proceeded to ignore. A 21st rule that would have limited the size of congregations during Ramadan was rejected out of hand by the clerics, leading less fervent Pakistanis to wonder if Prime Minister Imran Khan had lost control of his government to the imams.

Writing at the Washington Post last week, Brookings Institution fellow Madiha Afzal anticipated precisely the indifferent level of compliance discovered in Rawalpindi. Afzal noted in advance what the police discovered during their audit: many of the 20 pandemic requirements were “impractical to follow” in the crowded mosques, and enforcement was nearly impossible with countless mosques holding five prayer sessions a day plus the extra Taraweeh prayers during Ramadan.

Afzal saw the Ramadan pandemic showdown as a power struggle between Prime Minister Khan, who “burnished his conservative image during his time in politics” and therefore “has more credibility with Islamists than most,” and fundamentalists who want Muslim law enforced by the secular government, while the ambitious and opportunistic Pakistani military looks for any sign that Khan’s position might be weakened by a clash with the religious establishment.

A prominent Pakistani religious leader named Abdul Aziz – a hardliner hard enough to have sent armed followers to make an unsuccessful stand against Pakistani troops when they raided his mosque in 2007 – told Al Jazeera that he and like-minded imams considered prayer more important than ever during the pandemic, particularly during Ramadan.

Aziz sneered at social distancing, finding the advice of doctors inferior to “the word of God” and saying that since he believes the coronavirus is a form of divine punishment, meted out “because we have filled the world with sins,” it would be sinful to compromise religious services in order to resist infection.

“We believe the people should not be made to fear things right now, they should have faith in God at this time, and to place their hope in him,” Aziz said. “If death is written for you, then it will come.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/05/pakistani-government-finds-mosques-routinely-violating-coronavirus-rules/

['Robert Kraychik'],2020-05-05,Gordon Chang: Trump Should Use Trading with the Enemy Act to Block Corporate Business with China,"Daily Beast columnist and The Great U.S.-China Tech War author Gordon Chang said President Donald Trump should use the Trading With The Enemy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to block U.S.-based multinational corporations from doing business with China, offering his remarks on Monday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host John Hayward.

Hayward highlighted Bill Gates’ praise of the Chinese Communist Party’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak as emblematic of “globalist billionaires” — and the world’s most-capitalized technology companies’ — alignment with China.

“We’ve gotten some sobering demonstrations over the past couple of weeks that our own multinational billionaire class is not necessarily on our side,” he noted. “More and more of these globalist tycoons in the United States and Australia and Europe are announcing [or] kind of quietly walking over to China’s side of this debate and at least saying we need to back off, that we’re never going to get anywhere by trying to investigate the coronavirus or blame them for it, and we should instead work with [China] in order to address the remains of the global pandemic. Is that surprising? Is there anything we can do about discovering that so much of our monied elite to lead is really more on China’s side than on ours?”

Chang replied, “It’s not surprising. Money is money. Business is business. I think that when we look at this, we’ve got to understand that we shouldn’t expect loyalty from multinationals. It’ll be nice to get it but that’s not the way business works. What we can do and what would be very effective is for President Trump to use his power under the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and just prevent the monied class from doing things which make them disloyal.”

LISTEN:

Chang added, “What we have to do is to find American national security and enforce it. Once we do that, business will get in line, because our market is more important than China’s market, especially with China on the way that it is now. So this is really up to us and we can do this.”

Hayward asked about China’s use of “sharp power” beyond its borders, referring to the one-party state’s procurement of cultural, political, and social leverage in the West by developing financial relationships with leaders within the three spheres.

“Maybe it’s time for us to get into the sharp power arms race,” considered Hayward. “China uses sharp power, which is economic leverage to compel foreign companies to follow their speech codes and toe the political line coming out of Beijing. We have vastly more financial power than they do, but we don’t use it like they do — ever — and in fact, our own political class would probably turn on any American leader who suggested doing this sort of thing that the Chinese government does repeatedly. We can’t beat them if we don’t start playing the sharp power game, can we?”

Chang quipped, “You should be national security advisor, John. That’s absolutely right. This is what we need to do. We need to use all the elements of our power. We haven’t been doing that. We’ve had a series of presidents who’ve been much more interested in protecting the interest of China’s communists than they are about the American worker. That has to stop. That is stopping with President Trump, who has decided he’s going to actually support the American worker over China’s communists.”

Chang added, “We need to push President Trump further, because he does have the power to make it really uncomfortable for people who believe more in communism than they do in democracy. Many of those people, unfortunately, are Americans.”

Mansour stated, “We shouldn’t expect loyalty from our multinationals. Their focus is on their bottom line, but we can use our policies to actually force them to comply… Our government can exert power to basically protect our national interests. I’m also thinking that we should be demanding certain things from these multinationals in terms of complying with human rights. Any company that is making products in China using slave labor or profiting from it should be held to account.”

Chang responded, “Absolutely, Rebecca. What we have is, for instance, Uyghurs who are being forced from their homeland to work in factories far from where they live. This is a crime against humanity. This is forced labor. This is Third Reich-type stuff.”

“First of all, the American people just need to hold these companies to account, and we know their names,” added Chang. “They’re big consumer companies. Also, it’s up to President Trump to use his powers to say, ‘No, this is going to be absolutely illegal. You’re not going to do this.’ It’s up to the President of the United States to change the incentives [and] to change the boundaries under which these companies act. These companies will act in the most disgusting, horrific manner possible. We just need to make sure they cannot do that.”

Chang concluded by maintaining his call for China to pay reparations to the U.S. over its negligence related to the coronavirus outbreak.

“As of today, there’s about 69,000 Americans who have died of coronavirus,” remarked Chang. “China deliberately spread the disease beyond its borders. Beijing killed 69,000 Americans and counting.”

['John Hayward'],2020-05-05,Pakistan’s Prime Minister Wants Coronavirus Bailouts for Poor Countries,"Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday called upon wealthy nations to finance a more extensive rescue package for developing economies in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Unfortunately, wealthy nations are grappling with trillion-dollar pandemic meltdowns of their own.

Khan is working with like-minded leaders to assemble a coalition at the United Nations to “commence consultations for proposing a comprehensive solution to the debt challenges of developing countries against the backdrop of Covid-19,” as Pakistan’s Dawn put it. His call for a bigger bailout plan than anything proposed to date was made during a phone conversation with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali.

“Global recession is imminent,” Khan told Ali, in a manner that suggested his intended audience was much broader than the prime minister of Ethiopia. “Developing countries would need a combination of additional measures to meet urgent financial requirements, sustain growth, strengthen fragile health systems as well as to save lives and provide social protection to those below the poverty line.”

Stimulus programs, loans, and debt relief for the underdeveloped world are naturally major topics of discussion as the pandemic grinds on. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are facing what the Wall Street Journal described as a “deluge of aid requests” from emerging markets. Appeals for a massive bailout have been made to the G20 assembly of the world’s largest economies as well.

Individual nations such as the United States, the European powers, and Japan have announced trillion-dollar global stimulus plans. As of Monday, over $10 trillion in bailouts were on the table to combat a global financial crisis the IMF compared to the Great Depression. Major industries that link the developed and developing world, notably including the airlines, are teetering on the brink of collapse. The world’s economic powerhouses have all taken massive hits from the coronavirus themselves, so their ability to protect and nourish poor economies is limited.

Largely absent in these bailout tallies is the country that should be compensating the world for the pandemic it unleashed, Communist China. The New York Times noted last month that while the rest of the world is “opening its wallet to fight the effects of the coronavirus outbreak,” the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is “holding back” on both aid to developing nations and domestic bailouts.

To date, the CCP has been unmoved by even the most polite suggestions that it could win all sorts of public relations credit for itself by sending some no-strings-attached aid to developing nations. Deeply paranoid about the dangers of a global backlash against it, the CCP seems more interested in insulting and bullying every nation that asks tough questions about the origins of the coronavirus than winning brownie points by handing out financial aid.

Beijing has a habit of trumpeting its “medical aid” to countries ravaged by the Wuhan virus – even when the “aid” is actually sold at retail prices and proves to contain equipment of exceptionally shoddy quality – but it seems wary of getting on the hook for any significant economic assistance, perhaps because its own economy is in much worse shape than the CCP wants to admit, and it is reluctant to provide any form of assistance that could be interpreted as an admission of liability for the pandemic.

London School of Economics professors Maitreesh Ghatak, Xavier Jaravel, and Jonathan Weigal wrote at the New York Times in late April to warn that over $100 billion in capital has fled emerging markets since the beginning of 2020, and the coronavirus bomb is still ticking in areas like sub-Saharan Africa.

Many developing countries were already facing severe debt crises before the pandemic – along with some much more developed nations such as Turkey – so they have no way to marshal emergency spending for medical equipment and coronavirus-related economic relief. More loans, even at very reasonable disaster rates, would only increase their crushing debt burdens, making investors even less likely to take a gamble on them once the pandemic recedes.

Cautioning that the developed world cannot sustain the shocks from a string of insolvencies and economic collapses in developing nations, the professors recommended a new “Marshall Plan” to “transfer resources immediately to the developing world on a massive scale,” which they dubbed the “Global Solidarity Fund.”

This plan may face the same problem Pakistani Prime Minister Khan and his alliance are likely to encounter at the United Nations: nobody has one percent of GDP to spare and there will be few takers for a bailout scheme that asks nothing more of China than it does of Germany or even virus-ravaged Italy.

As other bailout proponents have noted, even attractively priced loans are tough sells to teetering, overextended developing economies, but without even the faintest promise of repayment, anything else is difficult to ask from developed countries grappling with their own coronavirus economic meltdowns.

The American people are looking at unemployment and GDP reports that look like something out of a feverish nightmare and watching major industries wobble on the edge of the bankruptcy void; in two months we went from an economy performing beyond expectations to a world in which the prosperity of 2019 seems like a thousand years ago, and we may need to accept that certain goods and services we took for granted on New Year’s Eve will simply cease to exist. Millions of people went from ambitious workers looking forward to career growth in a red-hot labor market to fearfully wondering if their jobs will ever come back.

From the perspective of macroeconomics, it’s true that if the coronavirus pushes the dominoes of insolvent Third World economies into a cascade collapse, the ensuing humanitarian calamity will horrify the compassionate people of the West and the fiscal shockwave will be felt on Main Street. The Chinese Communist Party’s irresponsible lies and lust for power have robbed those compassionate people of their ability to do much about it.

In the face of staggering unemployment reports like the one coming our way in America on Friday, there will be little enthusiasm for donating a percentage of our GDP to Pakistan or Africa, especially to countries that are already deeply in hock to China’s Belt and Road program of debt colonialism. Beijing should be expected to take care of its own colonial possessions. May it cost them every last coin in their treasuries, and in the secret offshore accounts of Xi Jinping and the rest of the Communist Party hierarchy.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/05/hayward-pakistans-prime-minister-wants-coronavirus-bailouts-poor-countries/

As of Monday, over $10 trillion in bailouts were on the table to combat a global financial crisis the IMF compared to the Great Depression. Major industries that link the developed and developing world, notably including the airlines, are teetering on the brink of collapse. The world’s economic powerhouses have all taken massive hits from the coronavirus themselves, so their ability to protect and nourish poor economies is limited.

Largely absent in these bailout tallies is the country that should be compensating the world for the pandemic it unleashed, Communist China. The New York Times noted last month that while the rest of the world is “opening its wallet to fight the effects of the coronavirus outbreak,” the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is “holding back” on both aid to developing nations and domestic bailouts.

To date, the CCP has been unmoved by even the most polite suggestions that it could win all sorts of public relations credit for itself by sending some no-strings-attached aid to developing nations. Deeply paranoid about the dangers of a global backlash against it, the CCP seems more interested in insulting and bullying every nation that asks tough questions about the origins of the coronavirus than winning brownie points by handing out financial aid.

Beijing has a habit of trumpeting its “medical aid” to countries ravaged by the Wuhan virus – even when the “aid” is actually sold at retail prices and proves to contain equipment of exceptionally shoddy quality – but it seems wary of getting on the hook for any significant economic assistance, perhaps because its own economy is in much worse shape than the CCP wants to admit, and it is reluctant to provide any form of assistance that could be interpreted as an admission of liability for the pandemic.

London School of Economics professors Maitreesh Ghatak, Xavier Jaravel, and Jonathan Weigal wrote at the New York Times in late April to warn that over $100 billion in capital has fled emerging markets since the beginning of 2020, and the coronavirus bomb is still ticking in areas like sub-Saharan Africa.

Many developing countries were already facing severe debt crises before the pandemic – along with some much more developed nations such as Turkey – so they have no way to marshal emergency spending for medical equipment and coronavirus-related economic relief. More loans, even at very reasonable disaster rates, would only increase their crushing debt burdens, making investors even less likely to take a gamble on them once the pandemic recedes.

Cautioning that the developed world cannot sustain the shocks from a string of insolvencies and economic collapses in developing nations, the professors recommended a new “Marshall Plan” to “transfer resources immediately to the developing world on a massive scale,” which they dubbed the “Global Solidarity Fund.”

This plan may face the same problem Pakistani Prime Minister Khan and his alliance are likely to encounter at the United Nations: nobody has one percent of GDP to spare and there will be few takers for a bailout scheme that asks nothing more of China than it does of Germany or even virus-ravaged Italy.

As other bailout proponents have noted, even attractively priced loans are tough sells to teetering, overextended developing economies, but without even the faintest promise of repayment, anything else is difficult to ask from developed countries grappling with their own coronavirus economic meltdowns.

The American people are looking at unemployment and GDP reports that look like something out of a feverish nightmare and watching major industries wobble on the edge of the bankruptcy void; in two months we went from an economy performing beyond expectations to a world in which the prosperity of 2019 seems like a thousand years ago, and we may need to accept that certain goods and services we took for granted on New Year’s Eve will simply cease to exist. Millions of people went from ambitious workers looking forward to career growth in a red-hot labor market to fearfully wondering if their jobs will ever come back.

From the perspective of macroeconomics, it’s true that if the coronavirus pushes the dominoes of insolvent Third World economies into a cascade collapse, the ensuing humanitarian calamity will horrify the compassionate people of the West and the fiscal shockwave will be felt on Main Street. The Chinese Communist Party’s irresponsible lies and lust for power have robbed those compassionate people of their ability to do much about it.

In the face of staggering unemployment reports like the one coming our way in America on Friday, there will be little enthusiasm for donating a percentage of our GDP to Pakistan or Africa, especially to countries that are already deeply in hock to China’s Belt and Road program of debt colonialism. Beijing should be expected to take care of its own colonial possessions. May it cost them every last coin in their treasuries, and in the secret offshore accounts of Xi Jinping and the rest of the Communist Party hierarchy.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/05/hayward-pakistans-prime-minister-wants-coronavirus-bailouts-poor-countries/#disqus_thread
['Ben Kew'],2020-05-05,Venezuela: Maduro Abducts Two Americans Following Failed ‘Coup’,"Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro announced on Monday that authorities had abducted two American citizens on charges of working with an alleged U.S. military veteran who claimed to carry out a failed coup against his socialist regime.

In an address on state television, Maduro brandished passports allegedly belonging to Airan Berry and Luke Denman, who he accused of playing “Rambo” in a failed attack intended to remove him from power.

“We have physical and material evidence that the group trained on Colombian territory,” he declared. “It has been stated that the adviser to the United States showed evidence of expedition to assault the country and kill me.”

He did not specify who the “adviser” to the American government was.

According to Maduro, the pair were working with Jordan Goudreau, a man claiming to be an American military veteran who runs the Florida-based security company Silvercorp USA. They were abducted on Monday alongside 11 other men, one day after eight men were killed and two others detained in an alleged failed speedboat incursion into Venezuelan territory.

Speaking to the Associated Press, Goudreau confirmed that the two men were part of a mission named Operation Gideon, where they hoped to “liberate” Venezuela from Maduro’s leadership, who has led the once-thriving South American country into one of the world’s most serious economic and humanitarian crises. He is now working to try and get his colleagues released from custody.

“I’ve tried to engage everybody I know at every level,” said Goudreau. “Nobody’s returning my calls, It’s a nightmare.”

Sources close to or within the Venezuelan security forces told Reuters that the two men were arrested and are currently in the custody of Venezuelan military intelligence.

“While the people are in quarantine and at peace, terrorists were planning an attacking against our country. I denounce this before the Non-Aligned Movement,” Maduro continued, in reference to the group of far-left governments opposed to the United States. “Venezuela is standing up defeating the pandemic and terrorism.”

Maduro went on to claim that the plotters were working on behalf of Colombia, the U.S. government, and the nation’s legitimate president, Juan Guaidó, as part of an attempt to oust him from office. Representatives for Guaidó insisted in a statement Monday that they “have no relationship with or responsibility for the actions of the company Silvercorp,” while demanding that the human rights of detainees were respected.

Responding to the incident on Tuesday, President Donald Trump insisted it has “nothing to do with our government.”

“We’ll find out,” he told reporters. “We just heard about it.”

['Pam Key'],2020-05-05,"Whitmer on Biden Allegations: ‘Under These Circumstances’ with 70,000 Dead, We Need Joe","Tuesday on NBC’s “Today,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) dismissed the sexual assault allegations against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, saying “under these circumstances” due to the coronavirus pandemic Biden will be a good president.

Host Craig Melvin asked, “Your name, of course, continues to come upon this shortlist for Joe Biden. As you know, in the past week, the former vice president has been accused of sexual assault. He’s vehemently denied the allegation himself. You are a Biden supporter, one of his earlier backers. I know you are also a sexual assault survivor as well is there anything you want to add to the conversation, Governor Whitmer, that’s emerged over the past few days?”

Whitmer said, “I’ll just say you know I’ve read a lot about allegations. I’ve talked with Joe Biden. I am confident he is who he says he is. I do believe that women should be given space, and they should be listened to, but I also know it’s incumbent we vet thoroughly. In this moment, I think under these circumstances and the conversations that I’ve had with the vice president, I am confident he is who he says he is, and I believe him. I believe he’ll be a good president for the United States of America. Beyond that, you know, I don’t know there’s much more I can add. I simply know that we as a country should be very cognizant of the fact that 70,000 people—more than 70,000 people have died. We have lost the equivalent of a 9/11, and they anticipate that number daily between now and the end of the month. This is a crisis where 30 million people are unemployed in our country. Everything I’m doing is focused on saving lives in the state of Michigan. We need leaders are going to be focused on data and doing the right thing.”

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-05,Pressley: Biden Can Address Reade Allegations and Defeat ‘Occupant of the White House’,"Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) in an op-ed on Monday lamented the lack of justice for survivors of sexual assault but added that she rejects the “false choice that my party and our nominee [Joe Biden] can’t address the allegations at hand and defeat the occupant of the White House.”

“I’m here for an uncomfortable conversation,” the “Squad” member wrote in an op-ed demonstratively spurred by Joe Biden (D) facing accusations of sexual assault from former Senate staffer Tara Reade:

An open letter: It’s 2020 and We Still Don’t Know What Survivor Justice Looks Like in Publichttps://t.co/DzhiB1ydqg pic.twitter.com/tC3TNrlg5z — Ayanna Pressley (@AyannaPressley) May 4, 2020

It is a “necessary” conversation, Pressley said, adding, “I am a survivor. I am an elected official. I am not new to watching survivors bare their souls, and I am not new to being offered false choices in politics.”

The Massachusetts lawmaker said the Biden-Reade saga prompts an “urgent and visceral question.”

“What does an authentic path towards healing and justice look like for survivors in America?” she asked.

She admitted that there is no clear answer or path and stressed the importance of listening to survivors while slamming her Republican colleagues. They, she claimed, “slammed doors in the faces of survivors during the Kavanaugh hearings, and are spending millions to weaponize these allegations against Democratic women in purple states, do not care at all about survivor justice.”

Despite the sharp demonization of her Republican colleagues, Pressley essentially walked the line herself, attempting to reconcile her call for survivor justice with her innate desire to defeat the “occupant of the White House.”

She wrote in part:

Our assumptions and our starting points for these conversations have to change, and the allegations against Joe Biden are no exception. Listening to the stories of those who step forward is the baseline. We say “believe survivors” because, for nearly all of history, the experiences of survivors have been dismissed and derided by a society steeped in misogyny and hatred. We advocate that we begin with assumptions of credibility and move to due process and reconciliation. … We are in the throes of an election of the greatest consequence — one that will determine if core rights and tenets of democracy survive in this nation. The stakes cannot be overstated. But I have no patience for any person who tells me that is a reason to lower my voice. I reject the false choice that my party and our nominee can’t address the allegations at hand and defeat the occupant of the White House. [emphasis added]

Pressley accused Republicans of “using anything they can to undermine the Democratic nominee” and asked Biden and his campaign to “give a response that models the empathy, diligence, and acknowledgement of broken systems that this conversation demands.”

“I’m asking for true partnership with survivors and advocates, and for policy commitments that get us closer as a nation to reconciling our history of structural violence and oppression,” she said.

“There are survivors in every corner of this nation who can tell you what a more just America would look like. I, for one, will be listening,” she concluded.

Her piece earned praise from fellow “Squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who called it “powerful”:

“I reject the false choice that my party and our nominee can’t address the allegations at hand and defeat the occupant of the White House.” This OpEd from @AyannaPressley is powerful, her voice/advocacy offer a path for survivor justice and reconciliation.

Biden recently responded to Reade, who claimed that the former senator sexually assaulted her during her time as a staffer in his Senate office in the early 1990s. The Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee denied the claim in a lengthy statement last week, stating quite plainly that “this never happened.”

“I’m saying unequivocally it never, never happened and it didn’t. It never happened,” Biden said during last week’s appearance on Morning Joe.

“I don’t remember any type of complaint she may have made,” he continued. “It was 27 years ago. And I don’t remember, nor does anyone else that I’m aware of. The fact is that I don’t remember. I don’t remember any complaint ever having been made.”

The Biden campaign has reportedly circulated talking points for Democrat allies, detailing how to better address the allegations.

“Biden believes that all women have the right to be heard and to have their claims thoroughly reviewed,” the talking points read, as detailed by BuzzFeed. “In this case, a thorough review by the New York Times has led to the truth: this incident did not happen.”

The talking points mention Biden’s decades in public life and adds, “There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him — ever.”

The talking points also contend that “this alleged conduct would have been so wildly out of character for Joe Biden.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) is among those who have mimicked the campaign’s talking points, stating that she, a self-described feminist, has read a lot about the current allegation. However, she said she knows Biden and has determined that she is “very comfortable” with “who he says he is.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/ayanna-pressley-biden-democrats-can-address-reade-allegations-and-defeat-the-occupant-of-the-white-house/

Given the circumstances, this is the best course of action for the safety of students, educators, and staff. https://t.co/0mo9VUVq29 pic.twitter.com/qKgVcMP4uh — Governor Ned Lamont (@GovNedLamont) May 5, 2020

The governor said in a statement:

I know how important it is for so many students and teachers to finish out the school year, and I was holding out hope – particularly for high school seniors – that we’d at least be able to complete the final few weeks, but given the current circumstances and to protect everyone’s safety, it has become clear that it’s just not possible. I want to thank the many educators across our state who have stepped up to provide remote learning during this time, as well as the many staff members who’ve been putting thousands of meals together for students each and every day.

According to the executive order, schools will continue to provide distance learning and meals to children who received breakfast and lunch in school.

The announcement states Connecticut’s public schools “have served more than four million meals to students” during the coronavirus crisis.

“A total of 130 school districts are currently serving meals at 458 locations statewide,” it read.

Lamont ordered cancellation of in-person classes on March 17, and then extended the order twice, with the latest extension date being May 20.

“The difficult decision to cancel classes for the remainder of the year is based on the health and safety of our students, their families, and our Connecticut communities,” Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona also said in the statement.

The Connecticut Education Association (CEA), the largest union representing the state’s public school teachers, released a statement in support of Lamont’s decision:

CEA applauds Governor Lamont for listening to public health experts in his decision to close schools for the remainder of this school year. Making the safety and health of students and staff the top priority will help save lives and prevent the further spread of COVID-19.

“We understand the emotion and sadness regarding closing schools and missing certain milestones and celebrations, but at this time, everyone’s top priority must be to protect the health of students and staff, and to prevent the spread of the coronavirus,” said CEA President Jeff Leake.

“This crisis is not over,” Leake added:

[E]xperts say a resurgence of the virus could occur this fall. We must use the next few months to ensure that safety procedures and protocols are in place before students, teachers, and staff re-enter the classrooms. … These are unprecedented times, and they call for unprecedented responses. It is critical that the state and municipalities meet their responsibility to fund the resources students need when they return to the classroom—teachers, counselors, psychologists and strong academic programs.

Cardona added his department is “constantly improving access to high-quality materials and connectivity for our students.”

“Districts are working hard to find creative ways to celebrate the success of our seniors, as well as students who are transitioning from fifth and eighth grade,” he said, stating the panel working to reopen Connecticut is working on plans for summer school.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/connecticut-governor-closes-schools-for-remainder-of-academic-year/

['Frances Martel'],2020-05-05,China: Pompeo Betrayed Christianity with Wuhan Lab Remarks,"China’s state-run Global Times newspaper accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday of “betray[ing] Christianity” and bringing “shame to the evangelical Christians” of America for saying that “enormous evidence” exists linking the current pandemic to a biological laboratory in Wuhan, where it originated.

The first cases of Chinese coronavirus are known to have occurred in Wuhan, a central Chinese city of 11 million. Chinese officials initially stated that the virus originated in a “wet market,” where anyone can sell animal carcasses for consumption, and shut the market down in early January. Police “disinfected” the market, making it impossible for scientists to search for samples of the virus to study.

Now, China denies that the virus originated there, despite the fact that all earliest known cases were documented in Wuhan. Instead, Chinese officials have speculated that the virus originated in a U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland, offering no evidence to corroborate this claim. More recently – and in the anti-Pompeo editorial on Tuesday – Chinese media have begun floating the idea that some link exists between the Chinese coronavirus and diseases related to the use of electronic cigarettes in the United States.

The Global Times column on Tuesday was a response to Pompeo stating in an interview on Sunday that there was “enormous evidence” linking the Wuhan Institute of Virology to the pandemic.

“We’ve said from the beginning that this was a virus that originated in Wuhan, China. We took a lot of grief for that from the outset. But I think the whole world can see now,” Pompeo said. “Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”

Pompeo concluded that, while not complete, investigations appear to show “there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”

The Global Times responded by attacking Pompeo’s religion in an editorial titled “Pompeo Betrays Christianity with Lies.”

“It is generally believed that Pompeo is a devout evangelical Christian. Sometimes he even ‘preaches’ at diplomatic occasions, for which he was criticized,” the newspaper claimed, without providing examples of what sort of remarks it was referring to. “It seems that he does not care about being a subject of controversy. Nonetheless, his lying for political purposes is contrary to his label as a so-called ‘devout Christian.'”

“It is widely known that Christian doctrine opposes lying – it’s a sin. A false witness shall not go unpunished. And he that utters lies shall perish,” the editorial claims, placing an emphasis on retribution and punishment that is largely absent from the four Gospels that contain Jesus’s teachings and failing to mention the Christian promise of mercy and forgiveness.

“Pompeo has been lying. He has brought shame to the evangelical Christians in the US, misusing their trust in the Republican party. He is no doubt a degenerate politician and despicable from the perspective of religion,” the article asserted.

The editorial claimed Pompeo “lied” in his remarks because he “hates socialist China and, in particular, cannot accept China’s rise. He hence launched a propaganda campaign to ruin China’s image.” It goes on to make a series of outrageous statements suggesting that the virus originated in the United States.

“For example, some Chinese, Japanese and even Americans have long suspected that some COVID-19 patients turned up when the US seasonal flu began last winter. There are even some reports that the lipoid pneumonia cases from vaping e-cigarettes observed in the US last year were actually the COVID-19 cases,” the Global Times claimed, without offering any examples of these alleged individuals who have entertained the theory.

The Global Times article attacking Pompeo’s religion is a significant escalation from Chinese state media’s initial response to his comments, which was merely to call them a “bluff” and urge Pompeo to share the evidence that he claimed existed. It also follows a documented escalation in persecution of Christians within China during the pandemic, according to dissidents and Christians in the country.

China is one of the worst most repressive nations and allows only five legal religions to operate in the country: Christianity, Catholicism (separate from “Christianity”), Taoism, Buddhism, and Islam. China forces the clergy of all religions to use their positions to promote the Communist Party, despite the fact that the Party is by definition atheist. Avoiding government propaganda, many Christians in China opt instead for group prayers at home, typically called the “house church” system, which is illegal.

Persecution of “house churches,” many led by Evangelicals, has escalated during the outbreak. Multiple incidents of mass arrests of Christians for praying together have occurred. China has also targeted the legal “Three-Self Patriotic Church,” bulldozing legal church buildings and removing crosses. Witnesses to the incident say Chinese police bulldozed a church on Easter Sunday this year, the holiest day in the Christian calendar. Police also arrested Christians using online video services to pray together on the holiday.

['Ben Kew'],2020-05-05,Vladimir Putin Awards Kim Jong-un World War II Medal,"Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un a commemorative war medal to mark the 75th anniversary of the victory of Britain, Russia, and other allied forces over Nazi Germany in World War II, the Russian embassy in Pyongyang announced on Tuesday.

In its statement, the embassy said that it was presenting the world’s most repressive communist tyrant with the award for his regime’s preservation of the memory of Soviet soldiers who were buried on North Korean territory:

In accordance with the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation and the Chairman of the State Council of the DPRK, Kim Jong-un has been awarded the jubilee medal for the “75th Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945,” for his great personal contribution to preserving the memory of Soviet citizens who died and were buried on the territory of the DPRK [North Korea] and for the concern for the safety of burial places and memorials of Soviet soldiers in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Kim Jong-un did not attend the ceremony. Foreign Minister Ri Son-Gwon was presented with the award by the Russian ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matesgora.

It is not clear if the ceremony would typically be of the importance to attract Kim’s presence. His absence follows weeks of speculation regarding his health that recently culminated with him allegedly making a public appearance last week.

“[Ri and Matesgora] held a brief conversation during which they confirmed the spirit of continuing active efforts to consistently implement the agreements reached by the leaders of the two countries in Vladivostok in April 2019, aimed at further developing and strengthening multifaceted Russian-Korean cooperation,” the statement continued.

Photos of the meeting in Pyongyang showed all those in attendance wearing sanitary masks as a safeguard against the Chinese coronavirus, despite the fact that North Korea has yet to officially report a single case of the disease. Experts widely believe the country has been badly hit by the pandemic.

Kim Jong-un was scheduled to visit Moscow on May 9 to attend a military parade marking the anniversary of the victory, but the meeting and parade were postponed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Russia remains North Korea’s most steadfast ally, behind communist China, with Putin and Kremlin officials forging close diplomatic ties and opposing all attempts to isolate the Kim regime from the international community. Last year, Kim made his first official meeting with Putin in the Siberian city of Vladivostok. The Russian leader described the encounter as a “very wonderful time,” although nothing substantial with regard to plans to denuclearize the Korean peninsula was agreed at the time, or since it took place.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-05,"Chinese Coronavirus 'Charity' Triggering Disgust, Frustration in Zimbabwe","Zimbabweans have started to voice suspicion of the several coronavirus aid packages China has sent their country in recent weeks, accusing Beijing of using the aid to generate favorable publicity amid a global backlash against the country, Radio France Internationale (RFI) reported on Monday.

Many nations have criticized China for covering up its initial outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus late last year, greatly contributing to its subsequent spread out of the country to the rest of the world. The outbreak has since grown into a full-fledged pandemic responsible for 3,618,325 infections and 253,381 deaths worldwide.

Zimbabwe is connected to China through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a system of infrastructure development China uses across Africa and other parts of the world to establish regional influence. The BRI projects are advertised as lucrative endeavors for host countries when, in reality, they place the developing nations further into debt and force their dependency on China. In the past, China’s aid packages to Zimbabwe have typically been related to this BRI connection.

More recently, China has been donating medical aid – such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing kits – as well as large sums of money to Zimbabwe in an outward attempt to help the country combat the coronavirus pandemic. As RFI reported this week, China paid for an upgrade worth $500,000 to the capital’s main coronavirus treatment center. China has employed this new trend of “coronavirus diplomacy,” as critics refer to it, to generate positive publicity for itself, not only in Zimbabwe and Africa, but around the world.

Recently, Zimbabweans have increasingly expressed weariness of China’s self-proclaimed generosity in sending these aid packages, meant to contain a virus that China helped spread around the world.

“It may well be expending more energy on profiling these contributions in the face of bad press relating to its responsibilities around managing and communicating around the initial stages of the [coronavirus] pandemic,” Piers Pigou, a southern Africa consultant with the International Crisis Group, told RFI.

In April, Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo urged citizens not to blame a particular group of people for the origin of the coronavirus, in an obvious attempt to quell criticism of China, RFI reports.

On April 23, Zhao Baogang, the deputy ambassador of China to Zimbabwe, tweeted “[S]anctions harm Zim[babwe] more than COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus].”

In response, influential Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chinono tweeted back, “You think that Zimbabweans are so foolish that they would buy into your pathetic explanations when the whole world knows what is going on?”

“Corruption, Looting, and Chinese pillaging harm Zimbabwe more than anything else,” Chinono added.

“If companies like Huawei were paying taxes, Zimbabwe would not need donations,” he said, referring to a 2014 investment agreement between Huawei and Zimbabwe exempting the Chinese telecom giant from paying taxes in the country.

Last month, Zimbabwean lawyer Alex Magaisa questioned the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe’s decision to donate coronavirus medical aid to a foundation run by Zimbabwe’s first lady, Auxillia Mnangagwa, instead of Zimbabwe’s Health Ministry, New Zimbabwe reports.

Magaisa argued that giving urgently needed coronavirus material – including 50,000 masks, 510 protective suits, and 1,000 goggles – to Mnangagwa instead of directly to medical facilities created unnecessary bureaucracy. Magaisa says he believes the donation was a political move to appease President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

“Now they come through a non-state actor [the foundation] when the state entities exist … We can see through the veil.

Asked on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel to respond to a Wall Street Journal article that claimed the Trump administration will not be taking action against China if China abides by the terms of the phase one trade agreement reached earlier this year, Gidley said that while he had not seen the article, he does not believe that is accurate.

“I haven’t seen the article but I have to say just on its face what you’re telling me it sounds inaccurate,” Gidley told host Alex Marlow. “You’ve heard what the president has been saying about China. We’ve been tougher on China with the tariffs he put in place, with the deals he’s made, he actually was eyes wide open on China from day one. If you actually go back and look at his clips from Oprah in the 80s he’s saying the same thing about China eating our lunch while other people on the other side kind of ignore China and parrot their talking points. I saw a disgusting article in Politico yesterday where they were talking about how China came out unscathed in this and America is kind of the bad guy. I laughed at the byline because I can’t remember the author’s name but the author was the editor in chief for China content—I though ‘for China content,’ yeah that’s exactly right. That’s exactly what China wants him to do.”

The Wall Street Journal article used public comments from a number of Trump officials to infer that the president “won’t seek to punish China economically if Beijing abides by trade commitments made earlier this year.”

The two people the Wall Street Journal quoted were Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Mnuchin’s quote in the article does not even mention any kind of actions related to holding China accountable for coronavirus in the future. He just describes the unrelated effort to make China stick to the trade deal. “I have every reason to expect that they honor this agreement,” Mnuchin said in a Fox Business interview that was quoted by the Journal. Mnuchin added that China not honoring the trade deal would lead to “very significant consequences in the relationship and in the global economy as to how people would do business with them.”

Mnuchin is not quoted as saying anything about future efforts to hold the Chinese accountable for this crisis.

As it relates to the Treasury Department, though, this past weekend on Breitbart News Saturday the department’s spokeswoman, Monica Crowley, said that decisions on holding China accountable would become clearer after the public health and economic crisis in the United States subsides.

“I’m not going to get in front of the president or treasury secretary on any kind of policy discussions or decisions,” Crowley said then. “I know that the administration’s sole focus at the moment is making sure that the American people are safe, and that their well being is intact, and that they are kept safe and healthy, and that the other priority, of course, is the economic priorities in getting America stood up again and getting the economy roaring as only Donald Trump can do. I mean, he did it once, and he’s going to be asked to stand up and do it again within the space of four years, and he can do it because he’s got the pro-growth and economic policies that delivered it the first time around. After this, we will see what considerations are made with regard to making China accountable, and we will see where those discussions take us policy-wise.”

Pottinger, on the other hand, is quoted in the Journal article as having said during an academic conference regarding China: “The U.S. isn’t looking at punitive measures here.”

But Pottinger’s full remarks on China at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia paint a much different story than that short quote the Wall Street Journal plucked out. He berated China for silencing journalists and whistleblower doctors, he lambasted the Communist regime for Tiananmen Square, and he ripped into Beijing for denying its people freedoms—nowhere near an apologist view when it comes to China. Pottinger said in the speech:

Let me break his rule against discussing ‘isms’ to ask whether China today would benefit from a little less nationalism and a little more populism. Democratic populism is less about left versus right than top versus bottom. It’s about reminding a few that they need the consent of many to govern. When a privileged few grow too remote and self-interested, populism is what pulls them back or pitches them overboard. It has a kinetic energy. It fueled the Brexit vote of 2015 and President Trump’s election in 2016. It moved the founder of your university to pen a declaration of independence in 1776. It is an admonition to the powerful of this country to remember who they’re supposed to work for: America first.

That revolutionary tone does not seem to be much of a push to let China off the hook, and he may have just been saying that the United States is not looking at “punitive measures” because he does not want to frame administration action as “punitive.”

As such, during his Monday appearance on Breitbart News Daily, Gidley told Marlow that the president does intend to hold China accountable for its actions, but he did not provide specific planned actions yet.

“I can tell you the president–how that’s going to look and how that’s going to manifest I’m not going to get into on this show,” Gidley said. “But the president knows what’s going on here. He wants to make sure the American people are safe. He wants to make sure we can still work with nations. But the world knows now what we have been saying is fact, and China is culpable in this, and they weren’t giving us the good information. If you’re going to defeat a virus, if you’re going to defeat a plague, if you’re going to defeat pandemics, the best way to do that and the easiest way is with information and data. If there’s a country not sharing that information and that data with the world, it becomes much more difficult to get out ahead of this and to develop vaccines, to mitigate, to know how to contact trace where things have come from. Honestly, I think that even though the media at large doesn’t like the president being tough on China, even other countries now are pointing to the fact that they weren’t being truthful with the world, and that’s a serious problem for them, and that’s something we’re not going to forget.”

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-05,"Report: China to Move 50,000 Uyghur Slaves to Factory ‘Rust Belt’ City","The Chinese government has resumed a job placement plan for tens of thousands of Uyghur Muslim “graduates” of compulsory “re-education” camps in China’s western region of Xinjiang, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Saturday, quoting sources with knowledge of the project.

The plan was finalized last year, but disrupted by the outbreak of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. It includes a quota for the numbers of Uyghur Muslims provinces must take.

The “re-education” camps function as concentration camps, part of standardized measures designed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to extinguish the cultural identity of Muslim Uyghurs, a Turkic people, and other minorities in Xinjiang, a far western province bordering Central Asia. Xinjiang, or East Turkestan, is China’s largest province and has struggled with Beijing-ordered “assimilation” of local cultures for decades.

Critics of the CCP argue that the “students” and “graduates” of the re-education camps have been unwilling participants in the indoctrination programs, better described as detainees, who have endured torture, medical experimentation, and other human rights abuses. The U.S. government has estimated that between one to three million ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities have been detained in the camps; there are roughly 10 million ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang.

Beijing rejects these criticisms. It argues that the camps are meant to provide Muslim Uyghurs the training they need to find better jobs and avoid the influence of Islamic separatists in Xinjiang who promote terrorism, according to China, the SCMP reports. Many camp victims already had successful careers and ample education before Chinese officials imprisoned them, however, weakening this argument.

Now claiming to have its coronavirus outbreak under control, the Chinese government has resumed the job placement deal for provinces to absorb Xinjiang laborers, sources told the SCMP. There is no evidence the laborers have any control over or say in where they work.

“Excellent graduates were to be taken on as laborers by various inland governments, in particular, 19 provinces and municipalities,” said the source, without specifying what constituted an “excellent” graduate.

Some sources earlier told SCMP that the program may be scaled back in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended the world economy, but its latest report indicates that this is not the case.

“The unemployment problem in Xinjiang must be resolved at all costs, despite the outbreak,” the Beijing source insisted.

According to the report, at least 19 provinces and cities have been assigned quotas to hire Muslim minorities, mostly Uyghurs, who have “graduated” from re-education camps.

As early as February, when the CCP claimed that the daily number of new infections had started to decrease outside Hubei province, China began to send Uyghur workers to their new job assignments, the SCMP reported.

By the end of February, Xinjiang alone had created “jobs” for over 60,000 Uyghur “graduates” from the camps.

The southern city of Shenzhen was given a target last year to eventually resettle 50,000 Uyghurs; the city plans to do this in several stages, with 15,000 to 20,000 planned for the first batch, sources told the SCMP. The CCP commonly uses the word “batch” to describe a group of Uyghur workers, seeming to lend authenticity to the sources’ claim.

“For every batch [of workers] that is trained, a batch of employment will be arranged and a batch will be transferred. Those employed need to receive thorough ideological education and remain in their jobs,” the CCP said in a Chinese government work report from 2019.

On March 1, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) published a study on forced Uyghur labor citing this work report as an example of Uyghur labor transfers set up by the Xinjiang provincial government. The Xinjiang government pays a price per head to other local governments and private brokers to organize the work transfer of Uyghurs from detention camps to labor assignments.

The ASPI report, “Uyghurs for Sale,” found that more than 80,000 Uyghur workers were transferred out of Xinjiang and into forced labor between 2017 and 2019, in a program labeled “Xinjiang Aid” by the CCP. The report notes that this type of systematic forced labor and transfer of Uyghurs out of Xinjiang has been in existence since the early 2000s.

The city of Shaoguan was also asked to take on another 30,000 to 50,000 Uyghur workers, the SCMP claimed. Shaoguan, in the southern Guangdong province, was the site of a deadly factory riot between Uyghurs and Han Chinese in 2009. This incident was believed to have sparked a relentless campaign by the majority Han Chinese against the Uyghurs that has lasted for years and included the concentration camps as well as the installation of mass surveillance technology in Xinjiang and human rights abuses such as the use of Uyghurs for organ harvesting and forcing Uyghur women to sleep with Han Chinese “relatives” in the same bed while their husbands were trapped in the camps.

In Fujian province, a government source also told the SCMP they had been told to hire “tens of thousands” of workers from Xinjiang.

“I heard the first batch … would arrive soon [in Fujian]. We have already received official directives asking us to handle their settlement with care,” the source said.

He added that the preparation work includes providing halal food to the Muslim workers as well as setting up stronger security measures to “minimize the risks of mass incidents.”

In March, Anhui Daily, Anhui province’s official newspaper, reported that the eastern province had received 1,560 “organized laborers from Xinjiang,” says the SCMP. One company headquartered in Anhui, the Haoyuanpeng Clothing Manufacturing Co. Ltd (HYP), participates in “Xinjiang Aid” by exporting Uyghur workers from Xinjiang to Anhui province, according to the ASPI report. HYP advertises strategic partnerships with Nike, Fila, Adidas, and Puma on its corporate website.

In February 2018, HYP transferred 63 workers from Xinjiang to its Anhui factory, with plans to eventually transfer 500 in total, the ASPI report said. The transferred workers were described as “graduates” of a detainment camp known officially as the Jiashi County Secondary Vocational School, according to a government report seen by the ASPI.

The ASPI analyzed satellite imagery and official documents suggesting that the Jiashi “vocational school” had operated as a re-education camp since 2017. The Jiashi compound increased in size, adding new dormitories and factory warehouses. In addition, significant security features were added to the structure indicating a secure “military-style management” of the compound, the ASPI reports.

Last month, reports surfaced that Uyghurs had been forced out of Xinjiang as early as March to work in factories in other provinces. The labor push was reportedly a similar effort by China to fill gaps in its economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Uyghurs were shipped out of Xinjiang by the thousands in this instance.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/05/05/report-china-move-50000-uyghur-slaves-factory-rust-belt-city/

['Frances Martel'],2020-05-05,Human Rights Watch to Africa: Don’t Let China Get Away with Racism,"Human Rights Watch called on Africa to unite and “unequivocally call on the Chinese government to cease all discrimination against Africans in China” on Tuesday, a response to ongoing reports of racist acts against black people in the country.

The reports have centered around allegedly anti-coronavirus policies in Guangzhou, southern China, home to one of the nation’s largest African populations. Restaurants in the city began posting signs in April explicitly stating they would not allow black people to enter. African citizens in the city said many landlords had abruptly evicted them, leaving them on the street, as hotels would not accept them either. Some said government officials had forced them into house arrest under the guise of quarantine even if they had not left the city in a long time, showed no signs of having contracted the Chinese coronavirus, and tested negative for the virus.

The Chinese Communist Party denied any racist acts had taken place on behalf of its citizens and claimed that the measures were necessary to curb the virus, which originated in central Wuhan, China. Chinese officials have insisted since late March that “imported” cases are the only threat to the Chinese, meaning foreigners require more scrutiny to keep the rates of infection low.

Some African governments have expressed disillusion with the Chinese regime, but many have deep financial ties to Beijing, compromising their stances. China has invested billions into a plan known as the “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), which it debuted as a plan to reconstruct the ancient Silk Road from western Europe to Beijing. Instead, it has invested in building expensive infrastructure projects in Africa, paid for through predatory loans offered to the local governments.

“African governments together should unequivocally call on the Chinese government to cease all discrimination against Africans in China, and carry out prompt and transparent investigations to hold to account all those responsible for discriminatory practices,” Carine Kaneza Nantulya, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement published Tuesday. “African governments should also press China to enforce measures to prevent discrimination in the future.”

The non-governmental organization’s China wing also demanded that the Communist Party “immediately investigate and hold accountable all officials and others responsible for discriminatory treatment.”

An article at Human Rights Watch’s site noted that “no evidence scientific basis” existed for discrimination against black people in the name of curbing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. It also asserted the Communist Party has long been complacent towards racism against black people:

Police frequently target Africans, often linked on Chinese social media with violent crimes and overstaying their visas, for immigration enforcement. Some job advertisements specifically exclude “heiren,” or blacks, or set a lower salary for African applicants. Some Africans report being paid less than their white colleagues for the same job. Many also said they have experienced of being turned away by taxis, restaurants, or shops. In 2018, a sketch aired during the annual Lunar New Year Gala on state TV featured a Chinese actress in blackface saying things such as “China has done so much for Africa,” and “I love Chinese people! I love China!” A Chinese laundry detergent brand advertisement showed a black man being pushed into a washing machine, getting “cleaned,” and emerging as a lighter skinned Asian.

The organization also published testimony from Africans in Guangzhou who experienced the allegedly coronavirus-related racism first-hand.

“We don’t know what to do, we don’t know where to go to, we have no money, nobody wants to talk about it. We want African governments to take up the issues with the Chinese government,” one man, identified by the pseudonym “John F.” said.

Others lamented that even the end of the pandemic would do little to help them. Micomyiza Jean-Claude, a citizen of Burundi, told Human Rights Watch, “Even after the isolation, people will shout and bully us, and call us ‘virus.’ Life will be different even after the pandemic.”

“I am very tired of being humiliated every day and African leaders keep quiet on racism going on in Guangzhou because they don’t want to spoil business they are doing together. The leaders give more value to business and close their eyes on humanity,” Jean-Claude added.

The first reports of racism against black people in Africa – not merely any African nationals – surfaced in mid-April in Guangzhou. Among the more outrageous reports was a sign posted at a local McDonald’s restaurant stating that black-skinned people were not allowed to enter the premises. Dramatic video footage of African citizens sleeping on the street – at a time in which most of the world is implementing some form of “stay-at-home” guideline – also surfaced. Locals not evicted from their homes complained that they were not allowed to leave their homes, even when testing negative for coronavirus.

“Some Africans in Guangzhou need to readjust their way of thinking. They are not onlookers in the face of COVID-19. Guangzhou is their second home,” the Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party propaganda newspaper, opined in response to the evidence of racism. “As a part of the city, they need to respect and comply with prevention and control measures just like everyone else. Controlling pandemic is not only for the benefit of the locals but also for the expat communities, including Africans.”

Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama declared his nation to be “extremely disappointed” by the reports and announced his government had demanded local consulate officials tally any material damages and every instance of racism against Nigerian citizens. Last week, Benjamin Kalu, the spokesman of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, announced a series of measures to hold China accountable for racism against Nigerian citizens.

2. There is no mutual respect where Chinese citizens are treated as kings in Nigeria while Nigerian citizens in China are treated as second rate humans, worse than dogs forced to starve and sleep in the streets. — Benjamin Kalu (Spokesperson House of Reps) (@BenKaluTweets) May 1, 2020

Among the new provisions would be a thorough inspection of Chinese citizens’ legality in being present in China. Chinese citizens in good standing with the Communist Party are known to regularly run afoul of local immigration laws in Belt and Road countries in Africa.

Attorneys in Nigeria also announced last week they are seeking $200 billion in damages from China for unleashing the coronavirus pandemic on the world.

Some said government officials had forced them into house arrest under the guise of quarantine even if they had not left the city in a long time, showed no signs of having contracted the Chinese coronavirus, and tested negative for the virus.

The Chinese Communist Party denied any racist acts had taken place on behalf of its citizens and claimed that the measures were necessary to curb the virus, which originated in central Wuhan, China. Chinese officials have insisted since late March that “imported” cases are the only threat to the Chinese, meaning foreigners require more scrutiny to keep the rates of infection low.

Some African governments have expressed disillusion with the Chinese regime, but many have deep financial ties to Beijing, compromising their stances. China has invested billions into a plan known as the “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), which it debuted as a plan to reconstruct the ancient Silk Road from western Europe to Beijing. Instead, it has invested in building expensive infrastructure projects in Africa, paid for through predatory loans offered to the local governments.

“African governments together should unequivocally call on the Chinese government to cease all discrimination against Africans in China, and carry out prompt and transparent investigations to hold to account all those responsible for discriminatory practices,” Carine Kaneza Nantulya, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement published Tuesday. “African governments should also press China to enforce measures to prevent discrimination in the future.”

The non-governmental organization’s China wing also demanded that the Communist Party “immediately investigate and hold accountable all officials and others responsible for discriminatory treatment.”

An article at Human Rights Watch’s site noted that “no evidence scientific basis” existed for discrimination against black people in the name of curbing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. It also asserted the Communist Party has long been complacent towards racism against black people:

Police frequently target Africans, often linked on Chinese social media with violent crimes and overstaying their visas, for immigration enforcement. Some job advertisements specifically exclude “heiren,” or blacks, or set a lower salary for African applicants. Some Africans report being paid less than their white colleagues for the same job. Many also said they have experienced of being turned away by taxis, restaurants, or shops. In 2018, a sketch aired during the annual Lunar New Year Gala on state TV featured a Chinese actress in blackface saying things such as “China has done so much for Africa,” and “I love Chinese people! I love China!” A Chinese laundry detergent brand advertisement showed a black man being pushed into a washing machine, getting “cleaned,” and emerging as a lighter skinned Asian.

The organization also published testimony from Africans in Guangzhou who experienced the allegedly coronavirus-related racism first-hand.

“We don’t know what to do, we don’t know where to go to, we have no money, nobody wants to talk about it. We want African governments to take up the issues with the Chinese government,” one man, identified by the pseudonym “John F.” said.

Others lamented that even the end of the pandemic would do little to help them. Micomyiza Jean-Claude, a citizen of Burundi, told Human Rights Watch, “Even after the isolation, people will shout and bully us, and call us ‘virus.’ Life will be different even after the pandemic.”

“I am very tired of being humiliated every day and African leaders keep quiet on racism going on in Guangzhou because they don’t want to spoil business they are doing together. The leaders give more value to business and close their eyes on humanity,” Jean-Claude added.

The first reports of racism against black people in Africa – not merely any African nationals – surfaced in mid-April in Guangzhou. Among the more outrageous reports was a sign posted at a local McDonald’s restaurant stating that black-skinned people were not allowed to enter the premises. Dramatic video footage of African citizens sleeping on the street – at a time in which most of the world is implementing some form of “stay-at-home” guideline – also surfaced. Locals not evicted from their homes complained that they were not allowed to leave their homes, even when testing negative for coronavirus.

“Some Africans in Guangzhou need to readjust their way of thinking. They are not onlookers in the face of COVID-19. Guangzhou is their second home,” the Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party propaganda newspaper, opined in response to the evidence of racism. “As a part of the city, they need to respect and comply with prevention and control measures just like everyone else. Controlling pandemic is not only for the benefit of the locals but also for the expat communities, including Africans.”

Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama declared his nation to be “extremely disappointed” by the reports and announced his government had demanded local consulate officials tally any material damages and every instance of racism against Nigerian citizens. Last week, Benjamin Kalu, the spokesman of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, announced a series of measures to hold China accountable for racism against Nigerian citizens.

2. There is no mutual respect where Chinese citizens are treated as kings in Nigeria while Nigerian citizens in China are treated as second rate humans, worse than dogs forced to starve and sleep in the streets. — Benjamin Kalu (Spokesperson House of Reps) (@BenKaluTweets) May 1, 2020

Among the new provisions would be a thorough inspection of Chinese citizens’ legality in being present in China. Chinese citizens in good standing with the Communist Party are known to regularly run afoul of local immigration laws in Belt and Road countries in Africa.

Attorneys in Nigeria also announced last week they are seeking $200 billion in damages from China for unleashing the coronavirus pandemic on the world.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-05,Anthony Fauci Checked on Sick 'Friend' Chris Cuomo Every Day,"Appearing Monday on CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he spoke daily with primetime host Christopher Cuomo during his coronavirus illness because he was worried about his condition.

A partial transcript is as follows:

CHRISTOPHER CUOMO: How do I know what Tony Fauci thinks? I’ve known him a lot of my life, but I’ve never known him the way I know you through this pandemic. I have spoken to you, almost without exception, every day. You have been calling me out of personal concern to make sure that I was okay, my wife was okay, my son was okay. 11 o’clock at night. Later. Waiting for my show to end, Saturday, Sunday morning, the rare time you have with your family. Why? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: First of all, you’re a friend. We have a professional relationship, but you’re a friend. I’ve known you, I hate to say it, since you were almost a kid. And the fact is, you were going through some difficult times. I don’t think that people seeing you on this show were really experiencing or realizing how you were really sucking it up to look relatively normal. But when you finished the show, when we started chatting at 11 o’clock, 11:30 at night, you were wiped out. You not only had the acute difficulty of the virus that was replicating in you, but you had some of the secondary effects. […] I cared about you, but I was worried about you. That’s the reason why I kept calling.

Cuomo announced he tested positive for the coronavirus on March 31 and said he planned to quarantine in his basement to prevent his wife and children from also contracting the illness. However, his wife, Cristina, and 14-year-old son, Mario, ended up getting sick anyway.

During Cuomo’s illness, a biker who identified himself as David, told the New York Post that he witnessed the CNN anchor violating quarantine on Easter Sunday by taking his family to inspect an undeveloped property in East Hampton. David alleges that when he confronted Cuomo about breaking quarantine, the newsman verbally attacked him. The biker, a lifelong Democrat who voted for the CNN host’s brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), said he was so shaken by the incident that he filed a report with the East Hampton police.

The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its service-sector index fell to 41.8 in April, compared with a March reading of 52.5.

Any reading below 50 signals that the service sector, where the majority of Americans work, is in a contraction. It was the first time the services index has been in contraction since December 2009 and it was the lowest reading since March of that year with the nation mired in the Great Recession.

In April, all major categories fell sharply with the business activity index dropping to 26, the lowest reading on record, while the new orders index fell to 32.9 and the employment index dropped to 30. Prices moved up.

Two sectors reported expansion in the quarter: public administration and finance.

“Due to increased loans from [the federal] stimulus package, [we are] seeing an increase in new business,” a respondent in the financial sector said.

James Rutherford, an analyst with Stephen Inc, said in a note recently that 1,043 Wendy’s restaurants, around 18 percent of the U.S. total, have listed beef items as out of stock.

Oddly enough, more than 100 of those locations still sell Wendy’s chili, which contains beef, according to Rutherford.

As food supply chains struggle to keep up with demand amid the Covid-19 outbreak, CNBC’s Amelia Lucas reports that nearly a fifth of Wendy’s U.S. restaurants have run out of beef, according to a study by Stephens Inc.

Rutherford’s note was first reported by CNBC.

The New York Post reports:

Hamburgers have disappeared from some of the fast-food chain’s restaurants as the coronavirus crisis roils the country’s meat supply. Some Wendy’s locations postedsigns warning that their signature “fresh, never frozen” beef was not available, photos show. Other eateries said they were not serving burgers with two or three patties, customers said on Twitter. Many restaurants in Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and New York restaurants are currently out of beef, while other states’ menus do not suggest there are any supply chain issues.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,Democrat Harley Rouda Spotted on Private Beach; Backed Public Beach Closures in Orange County,"First-term Democrat Rep. Harley Rouda of California was spotted on a private beach in Orange County — even as he supported Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) criticism of communities that kept their beaches open to the public.

Last Thursday, Gov. Newsom ordered a “hard close” of beaches in Orange County, having scolded communities in the county for keeping beaches open to large numbers of people during a heat wave the previous weekend. Local communities argued that most beachgoers had maintained “social distancing,” and resolved to add more law enforcement to beaches while keeping beaches open. That was not good enough for Newsom — or Rouda.

In a statement last Thursday, Rep. Rouda criticized communities that had kept their beaches open: “Opening beaches to thousands of Southern Californians during a weekend heat-wave without adequate social-distancing protocols was a reckless action that put the families of California’s 48th district in harm’s way.”

However, Rouda himself was seen on a private beach with his family in Orange County last weekend.

CBS News 2020 campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar broke the story (original emphasis):

Photos obtained first by CBS News show Democratic Congressman Harley Rouda spending time at a private beach in Southern California despite orders from Governor Gavin Newsom to close some public beaches in the area, CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports. Rouda, a first-term Congressman who beat Dana Rohrabacher, represents the 48th district, which encompasses Orange County. Last week Newsom specifically ordered a “hard close” on Orange County beaches after photos showing people not respecting social distancing went viral on social media. Rouda’s campaign manager said in a statement that Rouda and his family “were actively moving and adequately socially distancing on a residential beach, which has explicitly outlined beach access requirements in accordance with Governor Newsom’s beach order.”

Rouda defeated veteran Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) in the 48th congressional district in 2018, basing his campaign in part on accusations that the incumbent was too favorable toward U.S.-Russia relations.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019 that there was no evidence of “collusion” between the Russian government and any American citizen.

['Sean Moran'],2020-05-05,McCarthy: House GOP to Establish Investigation into Origins of Chinese Coronavirus,"House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Breitbart News during a press conference call on Tuesday that, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) continues to block an investigation into the origins of the Chinese coronavirus, House Republicans will move forward with their own investigation.

Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle this weekend that Pelosi would rather investigate President Donald Trump than the origins of the Chinese coronavirus and whether U.S. taxpayer dollars went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Intelligence officials increasingly believe that the virus leaked from the Wuhan institute.

“We should have an investigative body looking at these grants, but Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that,” Reschenthaler told Breitbart News Saturday. “So you have myself and House Republicans. I can tell you I’m going to continue to look into these grants.”

Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Ronna McDaniel echoed Reschenthaler’s statement on Monday, saying, “Instead of launching another witch hunt, Nancy Pelosi should be investigating the origins of this virus.”

“If she truly cares about oversight, she should demand answers regarding China, not @realdonaldtrump,” she added.

Trump retweeted McDaniel’s call for Pelosi to investigate the beginnings of the Chinese coronavirus.

Exciting to see our Country starting to open up again! https://t.co/My5yPSZdS3 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2020

McCarthy told Breitbart News that he believes that Pelosi is blocking an investigation into the virus.

“The answer is yes,” he said, confirming that he believes Pelosi is blocking the investigation. “And, if you saw my letter to the speaker a couple of weeks ago, one of the items was that Oversight should be looking at the [World Health Organization].”

“Every day that Congress is not in session gives a pass to China — makes us weaker in the process,” he added.

McCarthy then revealed that he was able to get bipartisan support for a committee to investigate China, but that later, Democrat leadership relented.

The Republican leader said, “I last year went to the Democrats, trying to get a bipartisan group to look at China. I had members, Republicans and Democrats, agree to it, and leadership first said yes on the other side. It was going to be an equal number, and now they backtracked on it.”

McCarthy charged that, despite Pelosi’s opposition to a Chinese coronavirus investigation, House Republicans will start their own investigation.

He said, “I gave my names up. We were going forward with it, but you will see that the Republicans, because the Democrats will not work together [with us] on that, we will put our own China committee together and not sit back and allow this to continue.”

['Amy Furr'],2020-05-05,Suspect Arrested for Wiping Nose on Clerk When Asked to Wear Mask,"A man was arrested Monday for allegedly wiping his nose on a store clerk’s shirt in Holly, Michigan, over the weekend.

In a Facebook post on Saturday, the Holly Police Department asked for the public’s help in identifying a suspect who entered the Dollar Tree store on N. Saginaw St. without wearing a mask and reportedly assaulted an employee.

Security footage showed the moment when the man, wearing a checkered shirt and sunglasses, walked behind the employee as she stood in one of the aisles.

“The clerk advised the man that all in-store customers must wear a mask to enter the store as stated on the signs posted on the entry doors,” the department said.

Moments later, the man approached the clerk and reportedly told her, “Here, I will use this as a mask,” then wiped his nose on the sleeve of her shirt before walking away.

The department said the man “continued to be loud and disruptive inside the store before leaving in a white possibly Ford window van.”

In an update Monday, the department explained that an arrest had been made in the case and thanked residents for their help.

“Thank you to all who shared this post, a viewer tip assisted investigators in determining the identity of the suspect,” the update read, adding that details on the arrest would be released following arraignment.

Michigan residents who chose not to wear masks in public would not face criminal penalties or fines, according to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

However, businesses did have the right to turn customers away if they were not wearing a mask, WWMT reported.

As part of its efforts to guard against the coronavirus, Dollar Tree made gloves and masks available for employees to wear while they worked.

“Our Associates are the heart of our Company, and I’m overwhelmed by their ongoing commitment to you and the communities we serve,” wrote the company’s Chief Executive Officer Gary Philbin.

Following the incident on Saturday, Holly Police Chief Jerry Narsh said the clerk did the right thing considering the circumstances.

“She’s fine. She was frightened. Clearly, when something like this happens it’s unexpected. She was upset, she did the right thing. She didn’t confront him in the store. She contacted her manager who contacted the police,” he concluded.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/crime/2020/05/05/suspect-arrested-for-wiping-nose-on-clerks-shirt-when-asked-to-wear-a-mask/

So why is Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms encouraging residents to stay at home and ignore Gov. Brian Kemp’s effort to begin reopening the city?

Black business owners should have the opportunity that Governor Kemp wants to give them: the right to reopen their businesses, maintain their livelihoods, and get back to work.

Mayor Bottoms will tell you that coronavirus fears are behind her warnings, but Georgia’s COVID-19 numbers lag far behind the rest of the country in terms of infections and deaths.

According to Google’s COVID-19 tracker, Georgia has nearly 30,000 confirmed cases and around 1,250 deaths, far below the cases and deaths seen by New York State, the epicenter of the pandemic, that is counting nearly 320,000 cases and over 19,000 deaths.

Mayor Bottoms says that beginning the path to reopening Georgia is “deadly.” Yet while it is true that African Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, it is also true that the vast majority of hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus are among older Americans with pre-existing health conditions.

So why not create messaging for the African American population of Georgia that allows black small business owners to explore the protocols they need to take to safely reopen, and encourage the most vulnerable members of the community to stay inside?

Framing the allowed but not mandated reopening of small businesses in Georgia as an implicit attack on an African American voter base more vulnerable to COVID-19 leads to misinformation and conspiracy theories, and is counterproductive to keeping Atlanta’s citizens healthy in every way, including economically.

Telling a young and healthy small business owner to wait until his or her business is fully destroyed with no chance of coming back because the “science” says so is the kind of messaging that will continue to hurt American citizens of all colors. Moreover, business owners should be given the opportunity to make decisions about their own businesses.

Bottoms’ vociferous stance against reopening the economy, ostensibly to protect black citizens, has the unintended consequence of hurting black business owners in the Mecca for black entrepreneurship.

As Y’Kheyo Underwood, owner of the Good Look barber shop in Marietta, Georgia, told USA Today: “The people who are at home and still getting paid by their companies. If you are in my position, with a small business, you know the only way of getting income is by opening up your establishment.”

Bad messaging – particularly the kind of messaging coming from Bottoms – is especially bad for black businesses. The shaming of Georgia residents of all colors eager to get back to work and run their businesses is wrong, and will hurt the citizens that public officials have pledged to help protect.

It’s up to the business owners and citizens of Atlanta, Georgia, and eventually the rest of the country to figure out a safe, sane way to reopen their businesses while ensuring the safety of our most vulnerable populations. We shouldn’t stand in their way.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/05/05/rob-smith-atlanta-black-business/

['John Nolte'],2020-05-05,"Nolte: 3,000 Moviegoers Flock to Three Texas Theaters on Reopening Weekend","At just three movie theaters in San Antonio, Texas, some 3,000 ticket-buyers showed up during the first open weekend since the coronavirus pandemic struck.

Tickets were discounted to just $5.41, and on the 19 screens in those three theaters, the offerings were only older titles — Trolls World Tour, Bloodshot, I Still Believe, The Hunt, and Bad Boys for Life. So while roughly $9,000 in ticket sales would not normally make the news, when you consider the discount ticket price, the lack of fresh titles, and the fact America is still dealing with a plague, this is being seen as a good sign people are eager to return to normal, and normal means a weekend trip to the movies.

Texas is one of the few states that allowed movie theaters to open up. The theaters are, however, required to limit capacity to just 25 percent. This means that every other seating row is closed off, and in the open rows, customers are kept six feet apart. If you come as a couple or party, you are allowed to sit together.

The concession stands are open, but no refills are allowed.

A Hollywood executive told the far-left Hollywood Reporter that this news “shows me there is a pent-up demand.”

The news is undoubtedly a good sign, and when you look at those titles, it is pretty safe to assume those Texans went to the movies just to go to the movies again, to feel normal again. Every one of those titles is already available through video on demand, and has been for awhile.

This news combined with the near-swarming of beaches (whether those beaches are authorized to open or not) does show a “pent-up demand,” a phrase President Trump has repeatedly used to describe his view of a future when the lockdowns end and the economy recovers by way of an explosion of activity and commerce.

We can only hope.

In the end, though, this is going to be a game of chicken… In order to truly test the waters, some Big Studio is going to have to take the risk of releasing a Big Movie… Will it be Disney’s Mulan or Marvel’s (also Disney) Black Widow? Who’s going to take the plunge to test the waters, especially with a title that needs to clean up worldwide in order to just break even?

As it stands, Christopher Nolan’s latest epic, Tenet, is scheduled to go first on July 17, followed by Mulan on July 27, and Wonder Woman 1984 on August 14.

Those are the only blockbusters on the summer calendar right now. This could change depending on how things go. What I mean is that those three titles could be pulled by skittish studios, or if those titles do well, if moviegoers return in throngs due to a pent-up demand, the massive holes in that summer schedule could be filled by a Black Widow (currently reschedule for November) and others.

It’s hard to imagine a summer with only three blockbusters.

A lot of what happens at the movies will depend on how savvy Americans are to the realistic threat of the coronavirus. As I have pointed out countless times in the past, it doesn’t really matter when things reopen. There’s no vaccine and there’s no risk of our health care system crashing, so it will be no safer to reopen in July than it is today.

Since we’re unlikely to see a vaccine in the next 12 to 18 months (if ever), unless you are willing to quarantine for at least another year, there’s no point in not returning to normal as soon as possible. That doesn’t mean you should be reckless. Masks, hand washing, and social distancing are good ideas.

Nevertheless, no one — not the scientists, not the Democrat governors holding their states in lockdowns — has been able to explain to the public what the public health benefit is to locking us down one day longer than today.

If the world is not going to be any safer two weeks, two months, or a year from now, why not reopen now? Why not return to normality now?

Of course, the fake news media have shifted the goal posts from us locking down to slow the spread of the virus as a means to keep our medical system from crashing (which makes total sense), to this absurd notion that we must now stay closed to save as many lives as we can.

If Americans fall for that ridiculous standard, movie-going will never return because we may never have a cure, which means it will never be any safer to return to normal than it is right now.

According to the media’s dumb standard of locking down to save lives, we can never return to normal until its 100 percent safe, and even a vaccine cannot make us 100 percent safe. That absurd mindset will kill the movies forever.

Of course, there’s always this solution.

['John Nolte'],2020-05-05,Nolte: 26% of Democrats Want Joe Biden Replaced After Hearing Tara Reade Denial,"With 26 percent of Democrat voters now calling for Joe Biden to be replaced as the Democrat presidential nominee, there is no question the former vice president’s Morning Joe appearance, where he denied sexually assaulting Tara Reade in 1993, was a disaster.

Only 61 percent of Democrats says Biden should not be replaced. And of those 61 percent, only a measly 41 percent say he should definitely not be replaced.

Morning Consult conducted the poll of 1,991 registered voters and showed them a 35-second video clip of Biden’s denial. There is a two-point margin of error.

When broken down by age, a whopping 40 percent of Democrats under the age of 45 want Biden gone, while just 15 percent of Democrats 45 and over agree.

On the issue of Biden’s credibility, when surveying all voters — both Democrats and Republicans — only 41 percent found Biden’s denial credible, while 38 percent said it was not credible.

Only 61 percent of Democrats found Biden’s denial credible, while 19 percent said it was not credible.

Only 53 percent of younger Democrats, those under age 45, found Biden’s denial credible; while 67 percent of Democrats 45 and up found Biden’s denial credible.

Tara Reade has credibly alleged that in 1993, while she was working in Biden’s Senate office, the then-Delaware Senator cornered her against a wall, forced his hands under her skirt, and forced his fingers into her vagina.

Biden denies the incident ever took place.

Reade is a lifelong Democrat and investigative reporters have found five contemporaneous witnesses who confirm Reade told them about the incident at or near the time Reade says it happened.

What’s more, there is video of Reade’s now-deceased mother calling into a 1993 edition of CNN’s Larry King Live looking for advice about her daughter’s problems with a “prominent senator.”

Except for this one Morning Joe appearance, and with the help of the corrupt corporate media, Biden has remained hidden and not faced any tough questions about the allegations.

Meanwhile, Reade is challenging investigative reporters to dig into her story and risked prison last month by filing a formal criminal complaint against Biden.

Reade has also called for Biden to open up his Senate papers, which are currently being kept in secret at the University of Delaware.

Reade claims she filed a sexual harassment complaint against Biden (this was separate from the alleged assault) and that a copy of the complaint might be found among Biden’s papers. Biden is adamantly refusing any outsiders access to those papers. He even refused the idea of allowing a judge to look though them.

Reade is the eighth woman to accuse Biden of sexual misconduct. In an effort to put the scandal to bed, Biden created talking points full of lies and in a disheartening repeat of the Clinton 90s, Biden sent prominent women out to lie for him.

The poll claims there is good news for Biden because he is polling better with Democrats on this issue than disgraced former Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) and then-Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) did during their sexual harassment scandals. By respective margins of 48 and 43 percent, Democrats found the misconduct allegations against Franken and Conyers credible.

But that glimmer of good news is a bit misleading. Nowhere in this poll are respondents asked the straightforward questions about whether or not they find the allegations against Biden credible. There is no apples-to-apples comparison.

A second bit of good news is that those who want Biden replaced are primarily young people, and it is safe to assume that some or most of those younger people are supporters of Bernie Sanders who might still be bitter over losing to Biden. Nevertheless, Biden will still need their votes in November and Reade’s increasingly-credible allegation is just one more reason for them stay home.

In this poll, Biden beats President Trump 45 to 41 percent in a head-to-head match-up.

Known as “El Boto or Marruecos,” Cesar Sepulveda Arellano, a leading member of Los Viagras Cartel and the founder of the faction known as “Blancos de Troya,” was in the state prison of Mil Cumbres in Michoacán awaiting trial for the murder of Buenavista Mayor Javier Urena Gonzales. However, on April 30, a state judge ordered his release after state prosecutors were not able to “present” enough evidence to move forward with the case.

In August 2018, El Boto placed a $100,000 hit on Jose Luis Lara, a writer for Cartel Chronicles and a founding member of the Self-Defense Movement in Michoacán. Less than 48 hours after the offer was extended, the Mexican Army and Navy followed an anonymous tip to a house in Morelos–where they arrested him. El Boto at the time claimed Lara was a spy for the U.S. government.

Almost immediately after his release, El Boto sent messages to avocado growers in Michoacán claiming they must pay extortion fees to his men. The release of the kingpin comes as violence between Los Viagras and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion spreads terror throughout the region. Both are fighting for control of the region’s drug production and trafficking routes.

['Lucas Nolan'],2020-05-05,Report: Adult Cam Site Suffers Massive Security Breach,"According to a recent report, adult cam website Cam4.com left almost seven terabytes of private data exposed on the internet. The massive leak contained nearly 11 billion records including payment history, email and conversation logs, and IP addresses.

A recent report from security researchers at Safety Detectives claims that the adult live-streaming website Cam4.com, which is owned by Irish firm Granity Entertainment, exposed a server database containing 7 terabytes of production logs dating from March 16, 2020, and increasing daily.

The Elastic Search database was reportedly completely unsecured and included a huge amount of user and company information including a vast majority of email data records belonging to users in the United States. Americans were the worst effected group by the leak, along with Brazilians and Italians.

The site owners were immediately contacted and the server was secured shortly afterward. After reaching out to Cam4.com, the Safety Detectives security team received a prompt response which also advised the researchers to contact another company called Smart-X.net. Cam4.com and Smart-X.net are both owned by a parent company called Surecom Corp.

10.88 billion records including personally identifiable information were leaked as a result of the unsecured server. The leaked data included:

First and last names

Email addresses

Country of origin

Sign-up dates

Gender preference and sexual orientation

Device information

Miscellaneous user details such as spoken language

Usernames

Payments logs including credit card type, amount paid and applicable currency

User conversations

Transcripts of email correspondence

Inter-user conversations

Chat transcripts between users and CAM4

Token information

Password hashes

IP addresses

Fraud detection logs

Spam detection logs

Some logs further revealed users’ password information. The number of emails leaked exceeded several million according to the researchers. U.S., Brazillian, and Italian users were reportedly the worst affected by the leak.

['Lucas Nolan'],2020-05-05,Report: Adult Cam Site Suffers Massive Security Breach,"According to a recent report, adult cam website Cam4.com left almost seven terabytes of private data exposed on the internet. The massive leak contained nearly 11 billion records including payment history, email and conversation logs, and IP addresses.

A recent report from security researchers at Safety Detectives claims that the adult live-streaming website Cam4.com, which is owned by Irish firm Granity Entertainment, exposed a server database containing 7 terabytes of production logs dating from March 16, 2020, and increasing daily.

The Elastic Search database was reportedly completely unsecured and included a huge amount of user and company information including a vast majority of email data records belonging to users in the United States. Americans were the worst effected group by the leak, along with Brazilians and Italians.

The site owners were immediately contacted and the server was secured shortly afterward. After reaching out to Cam4.com, the Safety Detectives security team received a prompt response which also advised the researchers to contact another company called Smart-X.net. Cam4.com and Smart-X.net are both owned by a parent company called Surecom Corp.

10.88 billion records including personally identifiable information were leaked as a result of the unsecured server. The leaked data included:

First and last names

Email addresses

Country of origin

Sign-up dates

Gender preference and sexual orientation

Device information

Miscellaneous user details such as spoken language

Usernames

Payments logs including credit card type, amount paid and applicable currency

User conversations

Transcripts of email correspondence

Inter-user conversations

Chat transcripts between users and CAM4

Token information

Password hashes

IP addresses

Fraud detection logs

Spam detection logs

Some logs further revealed users’ password information. The number of emails leaked exceeded several million according to the researchers. U.S., Brazillian, and Italian users were reportedly the worst affected by the leak.

In January, Breitbart News reported on another massive breach of the “pussycash” cam site network. That leak primarily focused on the personal information of cam performers.

['Lucas Nolan'],2020-05-05,Apple and Google Promise to Ban Location Tracking in Apps Using ‘Contact Tracing’ Tech,"Apple and Google have reportedly claimed that they will ban the use of location tracking in apps using the new contact tracing system being developed by the two tech giants that they say will help slow the spread of the Chinese virus.

Reuters reports that tech giants Apple and Google have promised to ban location tracking features in apps that take advantage of the new Wuhan coronavirus contact tracing system being developed together by the two Silicon Valley giants.

Apple and Google allege that unlike other systems, theirs will not collect location information or identifying information about those that test positive for the coronavirus. They also require that a person consent to the data that the companies do collect on them. The companies claim that health authorities will be able to include a way to verify that someone tested positive such as a QR code from a hospital, addressing concerns that people could falsely claim that they tested positive.

Google and Apple have both reportedly made changes to their mobile operating systems to allow the devices to exchange a private key with nearby smartphones via Bluetooth, logging when users come into close proximity. If an individual tests positive for the Wuhan coronavirus and enters that information into an app, 14 days’ worth of their contact with other users is sent to a server.

The phones regularly check if any recently encountered individuals have been reported as infected and alerts users with a notification. The notification states that someone they have been in contact with has tested positive and provides them with more information. This system is running on mobile devices running iOS 13 or on any version of the Android operating system from 2015 on.

Software firm Twenty which developed the state of Utah’s Healthy Together contact tracing app which uses both GPS tracking and Bluetooth said on Monday that the app “operates effectively” without needing to rely on Apple and Google’s new system.

“If their approach can be more effective than our current solution, we’ll eagerly incorporate their features into our existing application, provided it meets the specifications of current and prospective public health partners,” Twenty said.

The province of Alberta in Canada, which does not collect GPS data, stated that it has no plans to adopt Apple and google’s system for its ABTraceTogether App.

9to5Mac previously reported that Apple and Google are now using the term “Exposure Notification” to describe their system instead of “Contact Tracing” in an attempt to emphasize the benefit of the system and make it sound less like a surveillance system.

['Allum Bokhari'],2020-05-05,Bokhari: The Booming ‘Gig Economy’ Is a Plutocrat’s Paradise,"In days past, if you were risking your life for low pay, that likely meant you were a soldier. The upside: survival skills, high status, a free college degree, and good benefits. These days, though, you can risk your life for low pay and get none of those benefits, as a member of the pandemic “Gig Economy.”

As you might expect, the Gig Economy is booming at the moment — with workers being laid off from their regular jobs, the modern-day proletariat has few places to turn but companies like Instacart, to meet the rising demand for home grocery deliveries, along with the myriad companies offering restaurant delivery.

Good news though, Instacart is committed to the safety of its employees — oh no, wait, it isn’t. Instacart has failed to provide its rapidly-growing army of shoppers with an adequate supply of hand sanitizer, masks, and other personal protective equipment (PPE). Hazard pay? Don’t be silly — according to the Gig Workers’ Collective, the company hasn’t even increased its default tip amount beyond 10 percent.

The “gig economy” is a new phrase, coined by Silicon Valley to make modern-day tech slavery sound cute. What it really means is that you’ll work harder than your parents did, for less pay, with less stability, with no benefits, and no workers’ rights.

The classic example is ridesharing apps, which displaced the once-stable industry of taxi cabs. There once was a time where taxi cab drivers could earn a decent living, even support a family on their salary. Try doing that with Uber or Lyft! According to a report from several years ago, only four percent of Uber drivers stay with the company for at least a year.

Although if you’re going to earn a living driving, there’s not much of an alternative — taxi drivers in New York City who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to acquire official taxi medallions are now committing suicide as ridesharing apps displace their once-lucrative industry. Free-market libertarians like to praise the disruption brought about by the “invisible hand of the market,” but they neglect to mention that it sometimes carries a knife. That isn’t purely metaphorical either — the company admitted to 3,000 sexual assaults by its drivers in 2018.

The Gig Economy is, of course, an invention of the modern tech elite, which probably thinks American serfs are living the good life compared to the Chinese sweatshop workers who assemble Android and Apple devices (they’re prone to killing themselves too, by the way).

The tech companies know that depriving their workers of regular employment rights is key to their business model. That’s why Uber and Postmates, two giants of the Gig Economy, are suing the state of California to overturn a law that would classify their gig workers are employees.

Even when tech workers are given regular employee status, they are still treated with contempt. There’s no better example than Amazon. Run by the plutocrat of plutocrats, world’s richest man Jeff Bezos, the company seems to commit a new outrage against its employees every week. Most recently, the tech giant fired an employee at one of its New York distribution centers for daring to tell his coworkers – and the public – that there was a coronavirus outbreak at the facility.

Then again, this is the same company that patented a system to put employees in cages, reportedly pressures employees not to take bathroom breaks, and allegedly fires women for becoming pregnant.

My favorite example of Amazon’s intense hatred of its own employees is the “heat map” it uses on employees of its Whole Foods stores, to discover which ones are most at risk of unionization. On of the reported findings of the “heat map” is that stores with a higher level of racial diversity – and, presumably, less cohesion – are less likely to unionize.

With such Machiavellian warfare on their own employees, is it any wonder that a Gig Economy stalwart like GrubHub saw the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to pinch pennies from cash-strapped restaurants? The delivery app is accused of forcing restaurants to offer customers discounts, while still charging commission fees based on the full original price of deliveries. Delivery services are also trying to pull the wool over restaurant owners’ eyes by listing them on their apps without the restaurants’ knowledge, even when the restaurants in question don’t offer delivery or takeout.

Even before the virus, gig workers at Instacart were now so mistrustful of their Silicon Valley masters that they asked the U.S. Department of Labor to investigate allegedly missing tips. Instacart once even tried to make tips count towards workers’ overall wages, before backlash forced it to reverse the policy. And the app has yet to fix a loophole that allows customers to lure Instacart shoppers with the promise of big tips, only to adjust the tips downwards or cancel them altogether after delivery. Other popular delivery apps like DoorDash have also made headlines for adding tips to their bottom line instead of giving them to the gig workers.

Historians have long observed that a grim upside to global pandemics is that a reduction in the supply of labor leads to improved working conditions for survivors. Thanks to technology, it looks like the reverse is true of coronavirus. For America’s proletariat, the only light at the end of the tunnel is the notification on their smartphones, a message from their slavemasters in Silicon Valley, cheerfully reminding them that Pride month is next week and that their default tips have been reduced by 5 percent.

['Allum Bokhari'],2020-05-05,Bokhari: Tech Censorship Is Now a Public Health Hazard,"The Democrats and their progressive allies in Silicon Valley and the mainstream media have spent the last two decades convincing themselves that they are the “party of science.” In their frantic panic to censor material related to the Chinese virus, we’re now seeing the dangerous outcome of that hubris.

You would think that the doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, ranked as the eighth-best hospital in the United States by U.S. News & World Report, knows a bit more about medicine than the blue-haired censors at YouTube.

But the YouTube censors are convinced they know better, recently censoring a video from AYTU BioScience about “Healight,” an experimental UV light treatment the company is developing as a potential treatment for the coronavirus in partnership with a team at Cedars-Sinai.

AYTU BioScience is a Colorado-based pharmaceutical company publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange that has developed a wide range of successful drugs. You’d think they know a thing or two about medicine. But again, YouTube appears to disagree. After all, Silicon Valley’s masters in the mainstream media insist that UV light treatment, mentioned by the president, must be dangerous, wrong, and only advocated by “conspiracy theorists.”

In an exceptionally dishonest headline, Bloomberg Technology wrote that AYTU “sees an opportunity” in Trump’s comments on the treatment, even though the company and Cedars-Sinai had been investigating UV light treatment well before the president made his remarks.

Of course, UV light treatment is still in the early stages of research — if successful, the results will be published in medical journals, which doctors tend to pay more attention to than YouTube or NBC. Nevertheless, the censorship is still a problem — it stifles creative discussion around potential areas of research, and makes information about those area of research harder to find.

As we know from Breitbart’s past reporting, YouTube is happy to take censorship cues from the mainstream media. In 2019, the company altered its search results for the term “abortion” within hours of receiving a complaint by a left-wing Slate writer.

The censorship of AYTU is just one example of Silicon Valley’s coronavirus overreach. YouTube has also censored a video of two doctors in Bakersfield, California, who recommended an early end to the nationwide shutdowns.

Facebook has branded anti-lockdown protests “misinformation” whose organizers will be banned, and has censored a video from Project Veritas containing remarks from officials at a testing center in New York, as well as videos from Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro discussing the need to balance addressing the pandemic with averting economic disaster.

Twitter also banned Bolsonaro’s videos, as well as a post from Fox News host Laura Ingraham discussing hydroxychloroquine. The platform says it will ban coronavirus-related claims that cause “harmful activity,” whatever that means.

And let’s not forget that Chinese internet censorship, which helped prevent information about the coronavirus from getting out in the first place, takes place with the assistance of American technology companies.

Scarcely four months ago, the world was largely unaware of the Wuhan coronavirus. And yet, Silicon Valley believes it — or the media, or bureaucrats (who can’t make up their mind on whether we should wear masks or not) — has all the answers.

This is scientifically illiterate. Doctors and scientists aren’t known for agreeing with each other, and they especially aren’t known for agreeing with each other when so little is known about the virus. Scientists in New York say that smoking raises the risk of severe coronavirus symptoms. Scientists in France say that smoking might actually help the body fight coronavirus symptoms. Who’s right? We don’t know — especially because there’s barely been time to carry out tests. In the world of science and medicine, what matters is not consensus, but rather testing that follows the scientific method and reproducible results.

But surely there are some quacks who should never be listened to? No doubt, but I challenge you to find a method for identifying them. Silicon Valley’s method appears to be: do what the mainstream media says, regardless of their woeful track record of fake news.

But even the “medical establishment” (if such a thing exists, given that doctors disagree about almost everything) can get it wrong. The ideas of Joseph Lister, the Victorian pioneer of antiseptic surgical techniques, were roundly mocked by the medical establishment of the day, including the world’s most prestigious medical journal, The Lancet.

It’s not hard to see why Lister was denounced. After all, he proposed pouring caustic acid on wounds! That sounds as crazy as using UV light, which can cause skin cancer and strokes, as a medical cure. And yet today, antiseptic treatments are taught in every medical textbook.

And what about Edward Jenner, the inventor of the first-ever vaccine, the one that eliminated smallpox? The establishment today love to tout their pro-vaccine credentials, but the establishment of Jenner’s day wasn’t so sure. The Royal Society, the leading scientific society in the world at the time, initially declined to publish Jenner’s paper explaining his research.

And it wasn’t until 1840 — more than four decades after Jenner began his research — that the British government rolled out his smallpox vaccines nationwide. No doubt there were more than a few people at the time who thought that Jenner’s vaccine — which involved injecting children with pus from diseased cows — sounded insane and dangerous. And yet, without the Jenner vaccine, billions of lives would have been otherwise lost to smallpox.

Now, consider this: what if, in Lister and Jenner’s day, all information was controlled by a handful of technology companies that did whatever the establishment told them? Would they have been banned as crackpots and snake-oil salesmen? It’s highly likely. From the Georgian doctor who thought injecting children with a cow virus would be a neat idea, to the 19th-century surgeon who thought to throw acid on wounds to clean them, “crackpots” have been behind more scientific and medical advances than the establishment would care to admit.

The only question is, how many cures will be stopped or delayed by Silicon Valley hyper-censorship, with its insufferable insistence that every truth and every fact is already known?

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-05,Donald Trump: CDC Study Predicting Coronavirus Death Spike Lacks Social Distancing Data,"President Donald Trump at the White House on Tuesday disputed a leaked Centers for Disease Control report showing that daily coronavirus deaths would spike in June.

“That’s a report with no mitigation,” Trump said as he left the White House for a trip to Arizona. “So based on no mitigation, but we’re doing a lot of mitigation.”

The New York Times leaked the CDC study on Monday, suggesting that the president was ignoring the facts about the virus while pushing the country to reopen.

The White House disputed the document on Monday, noting that it did not track with the model used by the Coronavirus Task Force.

Trump said that it was possible to open up the country again and let Americans return to work with social distancing and increased hygiene.

“The fact that they’re out, they’re mitigating, they’re social distancing, they all know that, they’re washing their hands a lot,” he said. “But we have to get our country open.”

The president also disputed the IHME model showing 134,000 deaths by August, again claiming that the data used in the model assumed no mitigation.

“Look, models have been very inaccurate, I’ve seen models that are very inaccurate,” Trump said.

But the president defended the models that predicted up to 2 million deaths in the United States without closing down the country.

“We did everything right, but now it’s time to go back to work,” he said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/donald-trump-cdc-study-predicting-coronavirus-death-spike-lacks-social-distancing-data/

Trump said that it was possible to open up the country again and let Americans return to work with social distancing and increased hygiene.

“The fact that they’re out, they’re mitigating, they’re social distancing, they all know that, they’re washing their hands a lot,” he said. “But we have to get our country open.”

The president also disputed the IHME model showing 134,000 deaths by August, again claiming that the data used in the model assumed no mitigation.

“Look, models have been very inaccurate, I’ve seen models that are very inaccurate,” Trump said.

But the president defended the models that predicted up to 2 million deaths in the United States without closing down the country.

“We did everything right, but now it’s time to go back to work,” he said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/donald-trump-cdc-study-predicting-coronavirus-death-spike-lacks-social-distancing-data/#disqus_thread
['Breitbart News'],2020-05-05,"New York: Over 1,700 Previously Undisclosed Deaths at Nursing Homes","ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities as the state faces scrutiny over how it’s protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic.

At least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state’s nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration late Monday that, for the first time, includes people believed to have been killed by the coronavirus before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test.

Exactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state’s latest disclosure, as the list doesn’t nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying.

The revised list shows that 22 nursing homes, largely in New York City and Long Island, have reported at least 40 deaths.

Parker Jewish Institute in Queens and Isabella Geriatric Center — one of New York City’s largest nursing homes with 705 beds — have reported the highest number of deaths: 71 and 64, respectively.

Audrey Waters, a spokeswoman for Isabella Geriatric Center, said in an email last week, “Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff. This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.”

In many cases, the state’s new figures reveal many more deaths than previously reported at nursing homes: Isabella Geriatric Center had 13 COVID-19 deaths reported as of May 1, and now reports the deaths of 21 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 along with 43 deaths of residents presumed to have COVID-19. And Ozanam Hall of Queens now is reporting a total of 53 deaths, up from just 10.

Several veterans home have been especially hard-hit by the virus: The Long Island State Veterans Home has reported 53 deaths; including 48 confirmed and five presumed COVID-19 deaths. The New York State Veterans Home at St. Albans in Queens has reported 33 deaths while New York State Veterans Home at Montrose in Westchester says 22 residents have died.

Cuomo promised on March 2, when only a handful of coronavirus cases had been reported in New York, to make a “special effort” for nursing homes and congregate homes housing senior citizens. The state directed nursing homes to screen visitors and consider modifying visiting hours on March 6, and later suspended visits to nursing homes statewide March 12.

But the governor is facing criticism over his administration’s role in overseeing and supporting New York’s overwhelmed, state-regulated nursing homes as many have struggled to treat COVID-19 patients, amass enough personal protective gear or ensure adequate staffing.

Advocacy groups for the elderly and family members of nursing home residents have called for greater transparency over COVID-19 cases at each state-regulated nursing home and criticized an April 1 state law granting some immunity to hospitals and nursing homes from civil and criminal liability. They also questioned the state’s March 25 policy that says “no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.”

The governor and his administration have defended that policy as ensuring nursing home residents aren’t left lingering in hospitals or without anywhere else to go. Cuomo’s spokesman tweeted Monday that the policy follows federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. But the federal guidance says only that a nursing home “can accept a resident diagnosed with COVID-19” so long as the nursing home can follow federal guidance on transmission precautions.

Cuomo has also said the state has facilities that can house transferred COVID-19 nursing homes patients, and he recently said that nursing homes that tell the state up-front that they can’t care for a COVID-19 patient wouldn’t face regulatory scrutiny. His administration hasn’t responded to a request for questions on the state’s current capacity to care for COVID-19 nursing home residents and whether nursing homes were informed.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/05/05/new-york-reports-over-1700-previously-undisclosed-deaths-at-nursing-homes/

['Katherine Rodriguez'],2020-05-05,Andrew Cuomo: Not Wearing Mask Is ‘Disrespectful’ to Frontline Workers,"Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a Sunday press briefing that people who refuse to wear a mask are being “disrespectful” to the frontline workers of the coronavirus pandemic.

“It’s disrespectful to the nurses, the doctors, the people who have been frontline workers,” the New York governor said during the briefing. “You wear the mask not for yourself, you wear the mask for me. It’s a sign of respect to other people… You know how you show love? By wearing a mask.”

“Just be responsible and show respect,” he said. “I don’t think that’s too much for each of us to ask of one another. That’s a basic common decency in this situation.”

In April, Cuomo ordered all residents to wear masks or other face coverings in public when they cannot stay at least six feet away from others in areas such as on public transit and in grocery stores.

WABC reported that Cuomo said getting outside for recreational purposes is “good” but told New Yorkers to continue to practice social distancing even as the weather grows nicer outside.

“Staying socially distant and wearing a mask are basic precautions that should keep you safe. Not as good as staying in the house, but should keep you safe,” Cuomo said Sunday.

Cuomo also took the opportunity to call out protesters recently for being “reckless” and “irresponsible” because they refused to wear masks at rallies.

The protesters, however, were frustrated with the governor for not reopening nonessential businesses, urging him to do so because of the toll the coronavirus shutdowns have taken on the state’s economy.

“I understand people’s frustration with the economy not being open. I get it. I want to see the economy open, for myself, for my family,” he said.

“I’m not going to put dollar signs over human lives. I’m not going to do that. Not for my family and not for yours. But I understand their point of view, and I understand the First Amendment. You have an argument, you’re going to make your argument, God bless America,” Cuomo continued.

['Penny Starr'],2020-05-05,Washington State Barber Opens Shop Despite Gov. Inslee’s Lockdown,"A barber who served in the United States Marine Corps decided to open his shop despite Washington Democrat Gov. Jay Inslee’s order “non-essential” businesses be shut and people stay in their homes — an order he extended on Friday to May 31.

But Martin decided he had to reopen to pay the bills.

At first, Martin served his customers in darkened premises until his supporters included the local police, Fox News reported:

He said he turned the lights and “Open” sign back on after seeing Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney’s Facebook post from last month that said he will not enforce the governor’s order because it is a violation of constitutional rights. “If they fine me, take away my license, or not renew it, I’m going to operate anyway,” Martin said. “What are you going to do now? I don’t need a piece of paper to do what I’ve been doing for 60 years.” Martin said he received support from customers who lined up outside the shop over the weekend, with some leaving extra tips and even paying double.

“I think more people are going to suffer from not being able to pay their bills than will ever suffer from the virus,” customer Eddie Donovan told the local Fox News affiliate KOMO News.

So far, 834 people in Washington state have died from the virus, according to state health department data.

“While hair salons and barbershops in states like Georgia, West Virginia, and Kansas have been allowed to reopen, shops forced to remain closed in other states are, like Martin, feeling the economic strain under the lockdown,” KOMO News reported.

Meanwhile, hair salon owner Lindsey Graham, of Salem, Ore., told FOX12 she was reopening on Tuesday for her family’s well-being, despite Democrat Gov. Kate Brown’s lockdown order.

“I’m risking going to jail to do it,” Graham said. “That’s how important it is to my family.”

Oregon state officials have said those who don’t comply with the order could face misdemeanor charges leading to a fine or even time behind bars.

Host Mike Brzezinski asked Schumer if Americans can trust the president and the government to provide “clear” and “salient information and advice” regarding the pandemic.

Schumer stressed the importance of holding hearings on Trump and the White House’s handling of the pandemic because they could bring in “experts who are not part of the government to tell the truth.”

“[T]here are certain people maybe we can trust, and that’s why we want to have hearings and that’s why we want to ask them questions,” Schumer said. “I mean, Fauci has been muzzled at times, but at times has spoken the truth. I’d say the same of Birx. If we had real hearings, we could bring in experts who are not part of the government to tell the truth.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-05,Dr. Anthony Fauci: Coronavirus Likely Wasn’t Created in Wuhan Lab,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, dismissed theories that the Chinese coronavirus was created in a laboratory in Wuhan.

“If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what’s out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated,” Fauci said in an interview with National Geographic published Monday.

“Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,” he added.

Fauci’s remarks come after Pompeo told ABC’s This Week that there was “enormous evidence” that the coronavirus originated in the Wuhan lab — not a wet market.

“China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,” he explained to host Martha Raddatz. “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”

“While the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” he added.

In late April, President Trump also indicated that he had a high degree of confidence that the illness came from the Chinese lab.

“Yes. Yes, I have,” the president responded when asked if he believed the illness could have leaked from the lab. “I think that the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves, because they’re like the public relations agency for China.”

“They shouldn’t be making excuses when people make horrible mistakes, especially mistakes that are causing hundreds of thousands of people around the world to die,” he added. “I think the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves.”

On Thursday, the Office of Director of National Intelligence issued a rare statement in which it announced it does not believe that the coronavirus was genetically modified.

“The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,” said the top U.S. spy agency. “The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”

The Associated Press reported Sunday that China “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in January in order to hoard medical supplies, according to a Department of Homeland Security intelligence report.

['Jeff Poor'],2020-05-05,Cotton: All Evidence Points to Coronavirus Coming from Wuhan Labs,"Tuesday during an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) argued the COVID-19 virus could be a product of the lab but, at the same time, “naturally occurring.”

Over the past few weeks, critics have been dismissive of claims coronavirus could be a product of a lab in China. However, Cotton points out there is a lack of evidence it originated from the wet markets, as many have claimed.

“All the evidence at this point points to two labs in Wuhan,” Cotton said. “No evidence — and I mean no evidence at all points to the seafood market in Wuhan. Now, all the evidence pointing to those labs, the fact that they used bats, that they research coronaviruses, that they have a history of bad safety practices, that the original person infected with the virus had no contact with the food market, all of that is circumstantial evidence to be sure. But in intelligence questions, we rarely get direct or conclusive evidence. So I agree that all of the evidence, albeit circumstantial, points directly at those labs. And if the Chinese Communist Party has evidence to the contrary, they need to bring it forward to the world.”

According to Cotton, just because the virus emerged from the lab does not mean it was “genetically modified or engineered.”

“Whether the virus was genetically modified or engineered is a highly technical, scientific question. And the weight of scientific opinion right now says that, no, this was a naturally occurring virus. But a naturally occurring virus can, of course, be present in a laboratory where it’s being studied. That is a different question from saying that laboratory might have had bad safety practices, and there could have been an accidental breach, which was the original source of what has become this terrible pandemic.”

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,Gavin Newsom: California Can Begin to Reopen Economy on Friday,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the state may begin to reopen its economy Friday, entering the next phase of his recovery plan.

According to “Stage 1” of the plan, retail stores will be able to offer curbside pickup, and there may be further allowances as the state makes progress in reducing coronavirus cases.

The governor “announced that bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, sporting goods stores and other retailers can reopen for curbside service Friday under new guidelines to be announced later this week,” the San Diego Union-Tribune reported, adding: “State officials cautioned that office buildings, shopping malls and restaurant dining rooms will not be reopened Friday, but later on in Stage 2.”

Certain urban areas, such as the six counties forming the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles County, may take longer to reopen, either because of state concerns or because of more restrictive local decisions.

The San Francisco Chronicle noted: “Six Bay Area counties are under a stay-at-home order through the end of May that is separate from the state’s shutdown, and Newsom said such counties could keep their stricter rules in place past Friday if they choose.”

San Diego County is also finalizing its own regulations, which require businesses to provide personal protective equipment and to implement social distancing guidelines, the Union-Tribune noted.

Some counties with few coronavirus cases had already begun to defy statewide orders. Newsom declined to tell reporters on his daily conference call Monday whether he would punish those counties, Calmatters reported.

The state will also develop an “army” of “contact tracers,” Calmatters added, who will be “public health workers tasked with tracking down people exposed to the virus so they can safely self-isolate and prevent the disease from spreading.”

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said that he did not expect Los Angeles to reopen on Friday. “Our timing on opening may vary from other parts of the state,” he said, the Los Angeles Times reported.

On Monday, the City of Laguna Beach reached a deal with Gov. Newsom to reopen its beaches in four phases. Newsom had ordered a “hard close” of Orange County beaches last week over concerns about overcrowding.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,Gavin Newsom: California Can Begin to Reopen Economy on Friday,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the state may begin to reopen its economy Friday, entering the next phase of his recovery plan.

According to “Stage 1” of the plan, retail stores will be able to offer curbside pickup, and there may be further allowances as the state makes progress in reducing coronavirus cases.

The governor “announced that bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, sporting goods stores and other retailers can reopen for curbside service Friday under new guidelines to be announced later this week,” the San Diego Union-Tribune reported, adding: “State officials cautioned that office buildings, shopping malls and restaurant dining rooms will not be reopened Friday, but later on in Stage 2.”

Certain urban areas, such as the six counties forming the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles County, may take longer to reopen, either because of state concerns or because of more restrictive local decisions.

The San Francisco Chronicle noted: “Six Bay Area counties are under a stay-at-home order through the end of May that is separate from the state’s shutdown, and Newsom said such counties could keep their stricter rules in place past Friday if they choose.”

San Diego County is also finalizing its own regulations, which require businesses to provide personal protective equipment and to implement social distancing guidelines, the Union-Tribune noted.

Some counties with few coronavirus cases had already begun to defy statewide orders. Newsom declined to tell reporters on his daily conference call Monday whether he would punish those counties, Calmatters reported.

The state will also develop an “army” of “contact tracers,” Calmatters added, who will be “public health workers tasked with tracking down people exposed to the virus so they can safely self-isolate and prevent the disease from spreading.”

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said that he did not expect Los Angeles to reopen on Friday. “Our timing on opening may vary from other parts of the state,” he said, the Los Angeles Times reported.

On Monday, the City of Laguna Beach reached a deal with Gov. Newsom to reopen its beaches in four phases. Newsom had ordered a “hard close” of Orange County beaches last week over concerns about overcrowding.

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-05,"Philadelphia Reports Zero Coronavirus Deaths, First Day Since March","Philadelphia reported zero coronavirus deaths on Monday, marking the first day the city reported no deaths since March 24.

Health officials reported no new coronavirus fatalities in Philadelphia while adding 186 new cases of the virus, signaling a positive trend for the city.

“We’ve been through some tough times in this epidemic, but over the weekend the situation here in Philadelphia is starting to look better,” Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Tom Farley said, according to WHYY:

Philadelphia reported no new deaths caused by COVID-19 on Monday and just 186 new cases. City officials say it’s a hopeful trend.https://t.co/dhVwYpQfP0 — WHYY News (@WHYYNews) May 4, 2020

Monday also marked the third consecutive day the city saw less than 400 new coronavirus cases. Farley said the city’s total now stands at 16,040 positive cases.

“While the daily count has remained low over the past few days, some labs do not report results over the weekend, and the City has not yet received all backlogged results,” the health department added in a press release.

Additionally, the city’s death toll dropped to 726 after officials removed one of the coronavirus-related deaths over the weekend.

The drop in Philadelphia’s fatality rate follows last month’s controversy regarding inconsistent numbers on the state’s overall death count. The state saw two spikes in its death count followed by a decrease within the span of the week — a phenomenon health officials attributed to lags in reporting and the inclusion and subsequent removal of “probable” coronavirus deaths.

As Breitbart News reported:

According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the inconsistencies began on Sunday after the Health Department raised the death total by 276 overnight, bringing the total to 1,112. The death total saw another significant jump on Tuesday, going from 1,204 to 1,564 in a single day, giving the false impression of a surge in recent deaths. Health Secretary Rachel Levine clarified this week that the spikes were not reflective of current information, attributing the bumps to a computer glitch, a general lag in initial reporting (counting deaths that occurred weeks ago, in some cases), and the addition of “probable positive” deaths.

Pennsylvania had 50,092 confirmed cases of the virus and 2,458 related deaths as of Tuesday morning, according to the state’s department of health.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/philadelphia-reports-zero-coronavirus-deaths-first-day-since-march/

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-04,VA Gov. Northam to Extend Closure of Nonessential Businesses to May 15,"Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced on Monday that he is extending his executive order shutting down businesses deemed “nonessential” until May 14.

All nonessential businesses will remain closed for at least another week, Northam said on Monday. He extended the original order, which was set to expire this week, and extended it even further on Monday, through May 14.

However, he said he hopes the state can begin to move into the first phase of reopening next week, as early as Friday, May 15. Under Phase I, social gatherings are limited to groups no larger than ten, social distancing and teleworking remains in place, face coverings are recommended in public, and restrictions on businesses and religious gatherings are lessened.

Northam said:

Here’s the bottom line. You’ll be able to get your hair cut, but you’ll need an appointment. And you’ll see new safety measures in the salon. It means you can go out to eat again. But restaurants will use less of their seating so to spread people out more. Employees will wear face coverings and they’ll do more cleaning. Phase I means more retail establishments can be open. But they’ll have to operate at lower capacity. You can go to the gym, but with fewer people and more requirements for cleaning.

Phase II expands social gatherings, limiting them to 50 people. Social distancing and teleworking will remain in tact, face coverings will continue to be encouraged, and additional restrictions on businesses will be relaxed. Both phases could last 2-4 weeks “or longer,” according to the governor.

Phase III will remove limits to capacity in businesses and social gatherings and encourage “Safer at Home” for vulnerable populations. However, the final phase will require “no evidence of a rebound” of the virus “for a sustained period of time.” The final phase could be “10-12 weeks away, or more,” according to the slides provided by the governor during his Monday press conference.

Residents flocked to Virginia state’s capital last month to protest Northam’s “draconian, autocratic, administrative orders.”

“Just like the serpent deceived Eve in the garden, I believe that Northam has a great deal of Virginians deceived — that he’s doing a good job and that he truly has their best interest at heart,” Virginia resident James Delong, who attended the Reopen Virginia rally last month, told Breitbart News.

“I don’t believe that at all. I believe he’s a tyrant. I believe President Trump said it best, you know, when he said ‘Liberate Virginia.’ Without liberty, we have nothing,” he added:

['John Nolte'],2020-05-04,Rich McHugh Says AP Didn't Catch Tara Reade Changing Her Story,"Investigative reporter Rich McHugh says the Associated Press (AP) did not catch Tara Reade changing her story about the harassment complaint she says she filed against then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) in 1993.

In an effort to discredit and humiliate Reade, who alleges Biden harassed her, assaulted her, and then fired her in retaliation over her filing a complaint, the Associated Press made it sound as though Reade has changed her story about the compliant.

This is not true. Reade has not changed her story.

The AP told the world Saturday that “Tara Reade says a Senate report she filed against Joe Biden didn’t refer to sexual harassment or assault.”

If that were true, this would obviously be a big deal. Reade’s claim that she filed a complaint against Biden is the next step of the story, especially when Biden is refusing to release his Senate records from the University of Delaware, which is where any complaint is likely to be found.

The allegation from the AP, and a number of Biden supporters who have embraced the AP story, is that this report from the AP proves Reade is changing and embellishing her story.

You see, the AP interviewed Reade in 2019, way last year, and rather than report on the story at the time, the AP sat on the story until this weekend when it could frame its 2019 interview with her in a way that would suggest Reade changed her story about the complaint she filed.

But she has not changed her story, and two investigative reporters back her up on that fact.

Regardless, the AP and Biden’s defenders are still playing a deeply cynical and dishonest semantics game. Let me explain…

First off, Reade has never claimed she filed an official Senate complaint about Biden’s alleged sexual assault. (Under penalty of prison, Reade did file a criminal complaint earlier this year.) While five witnesses have come forward to confirm Reade told them about the assault at or near the time she said it happened, she has only ever said she filed a Senate complaint about Biden’s alleged harassment.

So there is no inconsistency in Reade’s statements about the nature of the complaint she says she filed.

The semantics game comes from the fact that Reade says she did not use the specific words “sexual harassment” in her complaint.

People are embracing this fact as though it matters.

But the fact Reade did not use the specific words “sexual harassment” in her complaint does not matter, because the behavior she says she described in the complaint is sexual harassment.

This is made clear in the AP’s own story:

“I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,” Reade said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press. “I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.” Reade told the AP twice that she did not use the phrase “sexual harassment” in filing the complaint, but at other points in the interview said that was the behavior she believed she was describing. She said: “I talked about sexual harassment, retaliation. The main word I used – and I know I didn’t use sexual harassment — I used ‘uncomfortable.’ And I remember ‘retaliation.’”

No fair-minded person — or news organization — would make an issue out the fact she did not use the specific words “sexual harassment” in a complaint when the behavior she says she described in the complaint is an obvious, textbook case of sexual harassment — most especially the part about “retaliation.”

The AP continued its word games with this:

But Reade is suggesting that even if the report surfaces, it would not corroborate her assault allegations because she chose not to detail them at the time.

That is meant to sound as though it’s some kind of new revelation, as though Reade told the AP in 2019 that — if found — the complaint will not back up her assault allegation, but in the year since she has been claiming it would corroborate the assault allegation. But the truth is that she has never said or insinuated any such thing. She has only ever claimed she filed a complaint about the harassment, not the alleged assault.

Because I care about facts and am aware of them, long before this weekend AP report came out — which is obviously meant to muddy the waters of those who have not followed the story closely, I have only ever referred to Reade’s official complaint as a “harassment complaint,” never an assault complaint. Why? Because, despite what the AP wants you to believe, Reade has always been clear on that point.

Finally, investigative reporter Rich McHugh, who has interviewed Reade a number of times this year, says that what Reade told the AP is consistent with Reade has told him:

This is consistent with what she told me about the complaint as well. https://t.co/0zd1mxzpG5 — Rich McHugh (@RichMcHugh) May 3, 2020

Once again, what we are seeing, courtesy of fake news outlets like the Associated Press, is a disturbing re-enactment of what the corporate media and Democrats did to smear and discredit Bill Clinton’s credible accusers during the 1990s.

This absurd and dishonest hair-splitting about “sexual harassment” is a perfect example of what the media did to attack and besmirch Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Monica Lewinsky, and Juanita Broaddrick 20 years ago — all in an effort to protect Bill Clinton.

Over and over again in the 90s, the media and Democrats aligned to launch campaigns of personal destruction against these women, and they did so with the exact same sleight-of-hand dishonesty we just saw from the AP.

This behavior from the media is as despicable as it is predictable.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) reportedly said Monday that former Vice President Joe Biden’s denial of sexual assault allegations brought forth by former Senate staffer Tara Reade was “credible and convincing.”

“I saw the reports of what Ms. Reade said, I saw an interview with Vice President Biden. I appreciate that the vice president took a lot of questions, tough questions. And he answered them directly and respectfully,” Warren stated, according to CNN congressional reporter Manu Raju.

“The vice president’s answers were credible and convincing,” she added.

Biden, the presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, publically addressed Reade’s claims for the first time in a Friday interview with MSNBC’s Morning Joe. The former staff assistant to Biden alleges that the then-senator sexually assaulted her while the two were in the basement of a Capitol Hill building in the mid-1990s.

“It is not true. I’m saying it unequivocally – it never happened. It didn’t. It never happened,” Biden told co-host Mika Brzezinski.

Warren also reiterated her support for Biden’s White House bid, saying: “I support the vice president, I support his campaign, and I’m proud to endorse him for president.”

President Trump said in a Tuesday interview with the New York Post that the former vice president “owes” the Massachusetts Democrat to be picked as his running mate.

“I think Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Joe Biden’s win because she didn’t drop out and Bernie would have won every single state on Super Tuesday,” the president explained.

“If he’s gonna win — and I don’t know that he makes it to the starting gate — but if he does make it to the starting gate, [Warren is] responsible,” he added.

Other possible vice presidential picks, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) and activist Stacey Abrams, have also expressed support for Biden against Reade’s allegations.

['Kyle Olson'],2020-05-04,Gretchen Whitmer Mimics Biden Campaign Talking Points on Tara Reade,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stuck closely to the Biden campaign script when asked about allegations made by Tara Reade.

Whitmer was asked by CNN host Jake Tapper about her reaction to the accusation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted Reade in 1993.

She replied:

As a survivor, and as a feminist, I’ll say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. Then we have a duty to vet it. And just because you’re a survivor doesn’t mean that every claim is equal. It means we give them the ability to make their case and the other side as well. And then to make a judgment that is informed. I have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I’ve watched his defense. There’s not a pattern that goes into this. And I think for these reasons, I’m very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is.

In April, the Biden campaign circulated talking points to its surrogates and supporters so they would play down the accusations and vouch for Biden’s credibility.

“Biden believes that all women have the right to be heard and to have their claims thoroughly reviewed,” they read.

The document continued in part: “…this alleged conduct would have been so wildly out of character for Joe Biden.”

“There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him – ever,” the talking points said.

Whitmer wouldn’t be the first Democrat to use those talking points.

During an appearance on CNN, Stacey Abrams made similar comments.

“I believe that women deserve to be heard and I believe that they need to be listened to, but I also believe that those allegations have to be investigated by credible sources,” she said.

“I believe Joe Biden. I believe that he is a person who has demonstrated that his love of family, his love of our community has been made perfectly clear through his work as a congressional leader and as an American leader,” Abrams added.

“I know Joe Biden, and I think that he is telling the truth and that this did not happen.”

Like Whitmer, Abrams is also believed to be vying to be Biden’s vice-presidential running mate.

['Kyle Olson'],2020-05-04,Gretchen Whitmer Mimics Biden Campaign Talking Points on Tara Reade,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer stuck closely to the Biden campaign script when asked about allegations made by Tara Reade.

Whitmer was asked by CNN host Jake Tapper about her reaction to the accusation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted Reade in 1993.

She replied:

As a survivor, and as a feminist, I’ll say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. Then we have a duty to vet it. And just because you’re a survivor doesn’t mean that every claim is equal. It means we give them the ability to make their case and the other side as well. And then to make a judgment that is informed. I have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I’ve watched his defense. There’s not a pattern that goes into this. And I think for these reasons, I’m very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is.

In April, the Biden campaign circulated talking points to its surrogates and supporters so they would play down the accusations and vouch for Biden’s credibility.

“Biden believes that all women have the right to be heard and to have their claims thoroughly reviewed,” they read.

The document continued in part: “…this alleged conduct would have been so wildly out of character for Joe Biden.”

“There has never been a complaint, allegation, hint or rumor of any impropriety or inappropriate conduct like this regarding him – ever,” the talking points said.

Whitmer wouldn’t be the first Democrat to use those talking points.

During an appearance on CNN, Stacey Abrams made similar comments.

“I believe that women deserve to be heard and I believe that they need to be listened to, but I also believe that those allegations have to be investigated by credible sources,” she said.

“I believe Joe Biden. I believe that he is a person who has demonstrated that his love of family, his love of our community has been made perfectly clear through his work as a congressional leader and as an American leader,” Abrams added.

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-05,Fact Check: AOC Says Support Biden Because We've ‘Had Kids in Cages',"CLAIM: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said during an April appearance on The View that Democrats must rally behind Joe Biden (D), the Democrat Party’s presumptive nominee, because it is an issue of “life and death,” stating, “We have had kids in cages.”

VERDICT: The “cages” Democrats frequently refer to — chain-link enclosures in certain border facilities — were set up during the Obama-Biden administration, virtually diminishing one of the main reasons Ocasio-Cortez believes it is important for Democrats to support Biden.

Ocasio-Cortez appealed to the false left-wing talking point during an April 15 appearance on the The View in response to cohost Whoopi Goldberg, who asked the lawmaker, “Do you think it’s time to have a conversation with Joe?”

“Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, I think right now just the stakes are too high when it comes to another four years of Trump,” Ocasio-Cortez said, stating that her community “especially” has been impacted.

“And it’s, you know, for a lot of communities, this is an issue of life and death. We have had kids in cages,” she claimed, also criticizing the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I think it’s really important that we rally behind our Democratic nominee in November,” she added:

Despite Ocasio-Cortez’s insinuation, the “cages” she and her Democrat allies consistently refer to were constructed during the Obama-Biden administration — not President Trump’s. Even Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security during the Obama-Biden administration, admitted that existing structures were not invented at the start of Trump’s term.

“Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on January 20, 2017, OK?” Johnson said during an appearance at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year, responding to the viral 2014 photo depicting the controversial holding facilities:

Johnson continued:

But during that 72-hour period, when you have something that is a multiple — like four times — of what you’re accustomed to in the existing infrastructure, you’ve got to find places quickly to put kids. You can’t just dump seven-year-old kids on the streets of McAllen or El Paso. And so these facilities were erected.

Biden has also denied the Obama administration’s role in constructing the “cages,” telling Univision’s Jorge Ramos in September, “We didn’t lock people up in cages.”

As Breitbart News reported:

Biden claimed that the Obama administration’s policies were more humane than those of President Donald Trump: “We didn’t lock people up in cages,” he said. In fact, the “cages” were built by the Obama administration to deal with a surge of unaccompanied minors who crossed the border illegally in 2014. Originally, the Obama administration was “warehousing” children — literally — in overwhelmed Border Patrol facilities. Breitbart News broke the story of the surge, which was partly triggered by Obama’s policy of allowing illegal alien children who entered the country as minors to stay in the country (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA).

Even PolitiFact deemed it “inaccurate” for Biden to claim that Obama’s administration did not put people in “cages,” and left-wing Snopes rated the claim “The Obama administration, not the Trump administration, built the cages that hold many immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border” as “true.”

Ocasio-Cortez has a history of making controversial statements regarding migrant detention centers, setting off a political firestorm last summer after accusing the Trump administration of running “concentration camps.”

“That is exactly what they are. They are concentration camps,” Ocasio-Cortez said of migrant detention centers during an Instagram Live last June.

“The fact that concentrations camps are now an institutionalized practice in the Home of the Free is extraordinarily disturbing, and we need to do something about it,” she added.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/fact-check-ocasio-cortez-says-democrats-must-rally-behind-biden-because-we-have-had-kids-in-cages/

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-05,Trump: Biden Obligated to Choose ‘Pocahontas’ Warren for Vice President,"President Donald Trump on Monday said that former Vice President Joe Biden was obligated to choose Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) as his running mate.

“She was responsible for his win, so, therefore, I think he owes an obligation to pick Pocahontas,” he said in an interview with the New York Post, referring to Warren.

Trump recalled that Warren refused to drop out before Super Tuesday, further splitting the far-left vote that would have helped Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

“I think Elizabeth Warren is responsible for Joe Biden’s win because she didn’t drop out and Bernie would have won every single state on Super Tuesday,” Trump said.

The president argued that Warren essentially saved Biden’s struggling campaign.

“I think he should pick Elizabeth Warren because Elizabeth Warren, more than any other person, including Jim Clyburn and including anybody you can name, is responsible for the win of Joe Biden,” Trump said.

The president said that Stacey Abrams was not a good choice for vice president, recalling that she lost her 2018 race for Georgia governor even with the help of Barack and Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.

“They were there all the time campaigning for Stacey Abrams, their new great star. That didn’t work out too well,” he said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/donald-trump-joe-biden-obligated-to-choose-pocahontas-elizabeth-warren-for-vice-president/

['Kyle Olson'],2020-05-04,Biden: Coronavirus an Opportunity to 'Fundamentally Transform' America,"Joe Biden echoed Barack Obama’s 2008 promise to “fundamentally transform” America on Monday when he vowed to use the coronavirus outbreak to alter the country.

Joe Biden calls coronavirus an “incredible opportunity…to fundamentally transform the country” Make no mistake: Joe Biden is the bannerman for the radical socialist wing of the Democrat Party. Biden and Bernie are two sides of the same far left coin.pic.twitter.com/RKiLqdy3pm — Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) May 4, 2020

“And I truly think, if we do this right, we have an incredible opportunity to not just dig out of this crisis, but to fundamentally transform the country,” Biden told a group of Latino supporters during a livestream.

It’s not the first time Biden has talked about leveraging the crisis to advance progressive policies.

He said April 22nd:

I believe, because, sort of, the blinders have been taken off, because of this COVID crisis, I think people are realizing, “My Lord. Look at what is possible. Look at the institutional changes we can make – without us becoming a ‘socialist country,’ or any of that malarkey – that we can make to provide the opportunities to change the institutional drawbacks …” from education, all the way through to all the other things we talked about.

On April 17th, Biden said, “We have an opportunity now to take, in a recovery act, a real recovery. We can fundamentally change the science relating to global warming.”

And on April 16th, he said, “I think we have an opportunity now to significantly change the mindset of the American people, things they weren’t ready to do, even two, three years ago,” all thanks to the virus.

The first vow to “fundamentally transform” the country came from Barack Obama in 2008.

“We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America,” Obama told a cheering throng of supporters at the University of Missouri shortly before the election.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-04,Democrat Operatives Launch ‘Committee to Draft Michelle Obama’ for VP,"A newly-launched committee called “Draft Michelle Obama” is pushing for Joe Biden, the apparent Democrat presidential nominee, to select the former first lady as his running mate.

“Joe Biden has said he would choose Michelle Obama as his running mate ‘in a heartbeat.’ The aim of this campaign is to build on the substantial grassroots support for a potential Michelle Obama candidacy and help garner media attention for a vice-presidential nominee who has the power to beat Donald Trump,” the group said in a statement released Monday.

The statement adds: “The Committee to Draft Michelle Obama firmly believes that Ms. Obama will not only benefit the Democratic ticket this November but also help lead this country to be more just and caring. However strongly we support Ms. Obama as Vice President Biden’s running mate, we will transfer our resolve to whoever joins the ticket to defeat the most dangerous incumbent in the history of our nation.”

The group, which filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in late April, is supported by Democratic fundraisers Nadine Hack and Mack Wilbourn, spokesperson Drew Zuckerman told The Hill.

Biden has said he would undoubtedly pick Obama to be his running mate, affirming in an April interview that he would “take her in a heartbeat.”

“She’s brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman. The Obamas are great friends,” the former vice president told CBS Pittsburgh.

Days later, former second lady Jill Biden echoed her husband’s praise of Obama, stating that she would make a “wonderful” vice president.

Though Democrats think Obama would boost lagging enthusiasm plaguing Biden’s candidacy, members of the former first lady’s circle say the move will never happen. Former White House official Valerie Jarrett recently poured cold water on the idea, saying there is “no chance” she would agree to run.

“The reason why I’m being so unequivocal is that there just simply has never been a time when she’s expressed an interest in running for office,” Jarrett told The Hill. “She’s not demurring here. She’s not being hard to get. She doesn’t want the job.”

The Biden campaign is currently vetting several women as potential running mates, including failed White House candidates Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Also under consideration are Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and progressive activist Stacy Abrams (D).

According to the FBI, there were 2,911,128 background checks conducted in April 2020. The closest any other April came to that figure was in 2019, when 2,334, 294 NICS checks were done.

April’s surge in background checks followed a March that shattered all one-month records. Breitbart News reported March 2020 witnessed 3,740,688 background checks, which were the most checks conducted in any single month since the inception of NICS.

The March and April surge came amid an unprecedented run on guns and ammunition during the issuance of coronavirus shutdowns, coupled with doomsday scenarios with civil unrest.

On March 19, 2020, Breitbart News quoted Kyle Olsen, owner of Arizona’s Olsen Firearms, saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this.”

He noted that the sales surge eclipsed what his store witnessed in January 2013, a time when Joe Biden was pushing numerous post-Sandy Hook gun controls for Barack Obama.

['Awr Hawkins'],2020-05-05,Poll: Americans Oppose Reopening Gun and Clothing Stores,"A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll shows 70 percent of Americans oppose reopening gun stores at this point in the coronavirus recovery process, and 69 percent oppose reopening clothing and other retail stores.

The Post reported the poll, conducted April 28–May 3, which also showed opposition to opening dine-in restaurants, gyms, golf courses, and nail salons.

The poll found that “67 percent [of Americans] say they would be uncomfortable shopping at a retail clothing store, and 78 percent would be uncomfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant.”

The Post-University of Maryland poll also found that Americans “give President Trump negative marks for his response to the outbreak” but “overwhelmingly approve” of doctors like Anthony S. Fauci.

A closer look at poll respondents shows more identified as Democrats than Republicans. Moreover, opposition to reopening gun and retail stores, golf courses, etc., was driven by Democrats.

For example, 61 percent of Republican respondents are ready to reopen golf courses, versus 30 percent of Democrats. Forty-nine percent of Republicans are ready to reopen gun stores, versus 14 percent of Democrats. Fifty-three percent of Republicans are ready to reopen clothing and other retail stores, versus 21 percent of Democrats.

The poll was conducted by telephone among 1,005 adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

['Awr Hawkins'],2020-05-04,Biden Enjoys Armed Protection While Fighting to Disarm Americans,"Democrat presidential hopeful Joe Biden is enjoying the benefit of armed protection while campaigning on a platform of disarming his fellow Americans.

On March 17, 2020, Breitbart News reported Biden began receiving Secret Service protection. Not only does this mean he is surrounded by good guys 24 hours a day, but it also means he is protected with the very guns he is trying to take from average Americans.

For example, a source told Breitbart News the Secret Service will protect Biden with pistols, semiautomatic rifles–perhaps ARs and/or Sig Sauer MCX platform firearms–and that fully automatic firearms will most like be part of the equation too. The full-auto firearms often consist of submachine guns on a sling, which allows them to be carried out of sight under a jacket or coat.

Ironically, Biden is campaigning on banning the average man from owning rifles such as AR-15s, AK-47s, and Sig Sauer MCXs.

On August 6, 2019, Real Clear Politics posted video of CNN’s Anderson Cooper asking Biden, “So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they’re going to come for guns?”

Biden answered, “Bingo. You’re right, if you have an ‘assault weapon.’ The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period.”

He added:

Look, the Second Amendment doesn’t say you can’t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own. You can’t buy a bazooka. You can’t have a flame thrower. The guys who make these arguments are the people who say the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots; we need the protection against the government. We need an F-15 for that. We need something well beyond whether or not you’re going to have an “assault weapon.”

But Biden is protected by the very weapons he says “should be illegal, period.” Moreover, he was protected by them during his eight years as vice president to Barack Obama.

When is the last time Joe Biden went out in public without armed security? But yet he doesn’t want you to be able to defend yourself and your family. He’s an out of touch elitist hypocrite. 📸: @bennyjohnson pic.twitter.com/1tNVZp3Z3D — NRA (@NRA) May 4, 2020

Also, the Secret Service is using standard-sized magazines in their rifles, i.e., which means 30 rounds. But Biden is campaigning to ban average Americans from having “20, 30, 40, 50 clips in a weapon.”

The bottom line–Biden lives behind layers of safety bolstered by guns that he says “should be illegal, period.” He is enjoying the benefits of those guns while working hard to be sure average Americans cannot own them.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-05,"Ohio U. Lays Off Gender, Race Studies Professors","Ohio University laid off three professors from the gender and race studies departments this week in response to financial burdens imposed by the Chinese virus pandemic. Ohio University also fired 140 unionized employees who worked in the university’s custodial, groundskeeping, and maintenance departments.

According to a report by the College Fix, Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, laid off three professors this week in response to financial difficulties imposed on the university by the ongoing pandemic. The now jobless faculty members were part of the gender and race studies departments.

The university has already been criticized for its decision to lay off faculty from the gender and race studies departments. Ohio University political science professor Kirstine Taylor wrote in a viral tweet that she was “heart-sick” over the university’s decision.

This morning Ohio University started laying off tenure-track faculty, starting with African American Studies. I am heart-sick. And I worry that this is the canary in the coal mine for other universities. Are any other institutions doing this? — Kirstine Taylor (@kirstinetaylor) May 1, 2020

Ohio University spokesperson Carly Leatherwood said that faculty salaries are the university’s largest expense. “The majority of the institution’s operational costs are in its employees, which requires the university to make extremely difficult decisions regarding our workforce, including today’s action,” Leatherwood said.

Over 3,000 members of the Ohio University community have signed a petition that calls on the university to reinstate the professors. “Entire academic programs, including African-American Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies are facing elimination. Faculty have been excluded almost entirely from the decision-making process,” the petition reads.

On Monday, the American Association of University Professors Ohio University Chapter released a statement in which it condemned the university’s decision. The group argued that the decision could “destroy” the university’s commitment to “diversity and inclusion.”

“Further, the ostensible decision not to renew the three faculty members in Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and in African American Studies will irremediably weaken or destroy programs that directly support diversity and inclusion, one of Ohio University’s primary institutional commitments,” the statement read. “These terminations must be reversed and there must be a halt to any further personnel decisions.”

Breitbart News reported in May 2018 that the Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion at Ohio University makes almost $200,000 per year. By comparison, the average full professor at a public university earns $126,000 per year.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-05,Department of Education Investigates U. of Portland for Feminist Student Club Excluding Whites,"The University of Portland is facing an investigation by the Department of Education over the exclusion of white students and faculty from a feminist student organization. The investigation is the result of a complaint by University of Michigan-Flint Professor Mark J. Perry who alleged that the practice constitutes a violation of Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race and color.

According to a report by The College Fix, the University of Portland is facing an investigation by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights over a student organization called the “Feminist of Color Collective” which excludes white students from its meetings. The group also regularly excludes male students from its meetings.

The complaint was filed by University of Michigan-Flint economist Mark J. Perry. Perry has filed Title IX complaints against universities and colleges against the country. Breitbart News reported in February 2018 that Perry filed a civil rights complaint against Stanford University after it instituted a policy that banned male students from the gym at certain times during the week. Perry has filed 129 complaints about sex discrimination at American universities and colleges to the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. 71 of Perry’s 129 complaints have resulted in investigations.

In an email to the Seattle office of the Department of Education, Perry argued that the feminist organization’s exclusion of white students constituted a Title VI violation.

Portland State University (PSU) is a public university that receives federal financial assistance and is therefore required to enforce Title VI’s prohibition of discrimination based on race and color. PSU is a public university in the state of Oregon and under the jurisdiction of your office. Therefore, I am requesting that the Seattle OCR investigate PSU for violating Title VI for the following discriminatory program as described in the photo of a flyer below that was publicized on Twitter by assistant professor of philosophy at Portland State University Peter Boghossian.

The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights confirmed this week that it is investigating the University of Portland over its support of the “Feminist of Color Collective.”

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-05,House Republicans Launch Probe Into China’s Influence on American Universities,"Republicans in the House of Representatives announced this week that they have launched an investigation into China’s influence on American universities and colleges. Many universities and colleges have cut ties with the Chinese government’s Confucius Institute over concerns that it sought to limit criticism of China on American campuses.

According to a report by Fox News, Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives have launched a probe into China’s efforts to infiltrate American colleges and universities.

In a letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, Republican lawmakers wrote that they are concerned that the Chinese government is using American universities and colleges to indoctrinate students.

“We cannot allow a dangerous communist regime to buy access to our institutions of higher education, plain and simple,” Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH) said.

The letter, which was signed by leaders of the House Committee on Education and Labor, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, House Armed Services Committee, House Committee on Homeland Security, House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and House Foreign Affairs Committee, asks DeVos to aid them in their investigation of China’s influence on American universities and colleges.

“For some time, we have been concerned about the potential for the Chinese government to use its strategic investments to turn American college campuses into indoctrination platforms for American students,” the letter reads.

The letter expresses concern that the Chinese government has exerted influence on American campuses through the Confucius Institute, an organization backed by the Chinese government that partners with American institutions to teach Chinese language and culture. However, many universities and colleges have severed ties with the Confucius Institute over concerns that it was designed to limit criticism of the Chinese government on American campuses.

“For example, a 2018 Hoover Institution report notes the presence of some 110 ‘Confucius Institutes’ on college campuses as well as over 500 ‘Confucius Classrooms’ in secondary schools,” the letter continues. “While the stated mission of such institutes and classrooms is to teach Chinese language and culture, the report notes, ‘faculty and other watchdogs have warned that they may present risks to intellectual freedom by using American universities as vehicles through which to advance Chinese Communist Party propaganda.'”

Breitbart News reported in January that Harvard University Chemistry Chairman Charles Lieber had been charged with fraud over his private financial relationship with the Chinese government. Lieber was paid millions of dollars by the Chinese government to work on “collaborative projects” between Harvard and the Chinese government.

['Bob Price'],2020-05-05,102 Migrants Apprehended in Tractor-Trailers at Texas Checkpoint in a Week,"Laredo Sector Border Patrol agents apprehended another 54 migrants locked in a tractor-trailer rig. The arrest occurred at an interior immigration checkpoint located about 70 miles north of the Texas-Mexico border.

Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials noted the apprehension is part of an increasing trend where cartel-connected human smugglers dangerously lock illegal immigrants in the rear of a tractor-trailer. The migrants are locked in with little-to-no air circulation, no bathroom facilities, and no means of escape in the event of abandonment by the smugglers or a crash.

Laredo North Station agents assigned to the Interstate 35 Immigration Checkpoint observed a white tractor-trailer rig approaching for inspection on Monday morning, according to information provided by Laredo Sector officials. During an initial screening, a K-9 alerted to an odor near the rear of the trailer it is trained to detect. The agents directed the driver to a secondary inspection station.

During a physical search of the trailer, agents found 54 people, including two juveniles, locked inside the hot trailer. The photo provided by CBP officials shows the cramped conditions and the danger posed by the heavy-tire cargo that would slide around in an emergency stop or crash.

Agents identified the 54 migrants as having traveled to the United States from Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. The agents placed the driver and his passenger, both U.S. citizens, in custody pending an investigation to be conducted by Homeland Security Investigations special agents.

In less than a week, Laredo Sector officials apprehended 102 migrants who were being smuggled in tractor-trailers at this single checkpoint.

“As temperatures rise, the Laredo Sector continues to see an increase in the number of individuals willing to put their lives in danger by being smuggled.,” Laredo Sector officials stated.

During an interview with Breitbart Texas in April, Laredo Sector Chief Patrol Agent Felix Chavez said smuggling in tractor-trailers is up significantly this fiscal year.

During the first seven months of Fiscal Year 2020, which began on October 1, 2019, Laredo Sector agents apprehended 1,071 migrants in motor-vehicle related incidents. This is up from 669 during the same period in FY19, the chief said. The use of tractors increased by 38 percent when compared to the previous year.

Chavez stressed that illegally crossing the border and the entire human smuggling process is very dangerous. He cited the callous treatment of migrants by the Mexican cartels and others engaged in the human smuggling process.

“They have no respect for human life,” the chief said, “even during the COVID-19 pandemic. To them, these people are nothing more than human cargo.”

The incident occurred on Monday afternoon in Tula, Hidalgo, just north from Mexico City. The unnamed victim was being treated at the hospital, information released by health officials stated. Video of the action circulated on some local social media accounts.

A prepared statement from the Tula Hospital revealed that the patient began to show symptoms on April 27 and sought medical attention on May 1. The patient was not listed in serious condition and was showing signs of improvement when he went missing. Officials closed the hospital for a search and found the patient on the third floor before the deadly jump.

The suicide comes as health officials say that the number of Coronavirus cases continue to rise. The latest figures show almost 25,000 confirmed cases since the pandemic started with 2,271 fatalities.

"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']",2020-05-05,Drones Outfitted with Explosives Seized in Mexico in ‘Active Terrorism Investigation’,"Authorities seized drones outfitted with makeshift explosive devices in central Mexico as part of an active terrorism investigation.

Drones fitted with C4 and other explosives were found in stash houses in the state of Puebla. On April 22, the Office of Mexico’s Attorney General received an anonymous tip about organized criminal activity that could lead to potential acts of terror.

On April 25, authorities obtained search warrants from a federal judge targeting three stash houses in San Andres Cholula, Puebla. Days later, federal agents and military personnel carried out raids.

Authorities seized three drones modified to carry explosives, an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives, gunpowder, and several homemade explosive devices called “chrysanthemums.” Other items included weapons, ammunition, and communications equipment.

Mexican officials have not released the name of the criminal organization involved, however, Puebla is home to a few increasingly powerful fuel theft gangs.

On April 22, news outlets in Puebla published photographs purportedly depicting members of Mexico’s National Guard having lunch with operatives belonging to a fuel gang known as the “Valencia Family.” The photographs caused substantial controversy, Proceso Magazine reported. It remains unclear if the investigation into the National Guard is also linked to the discovery of the drones. According to the National Guard, a high-ranking commander was removed from his post in Puebla and others are face similar probes.

"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']",2020-05-05,Drones Outfitted with Explosives Seized in Mexico in ‘Active Terrorism Investigation’,"Authorities seized drones outfitted with makeshift explosive devices in central Mexico as part of an active terrorism investigation.

Drones fitted with C4 and other explosives were found in stash houses in the state of Puebla. On April 22, the Office of Mexico’s Attorney General received an anonymous tip about organized criminal activity that could lead to potential acts of terror.

On April 25, authorities obtained search warrants from a federal judge targeting three stash houses in San Andres Cholula, Puebla. Days later, federal agents and military personnel carried out raids.

Authorities seized three drones modified to carry explosives, an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives, gunpowder, and several homemade explosive devices called “chrysanthemums.” Other items included weapons, ammunition, and communications equipment.

['Bob Price'],2020-05-04,"Guns, Cash Seized at Outbound Texas Border Crossing","U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers seized a cache of firearms, ammunition, and undeclared cash as smugglers attempted to move them across the border into Mexico. The seizures took place in four separate incidents.

CBP officers assigned to the Camino Real Bridge in the Del Rio Sector observed a 2008 Saturn Astro XR approaching the outbound inspection station on April 29. The officers referred the driver, a 35-year-old Mexican male, to a secondary inspection station, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector CBP officials.

During a search of the vehicle, the officers discovered 12,247 in undeclared U.S. currency. The officers seized the currency and arrested the driver and his 45-year-old Mexican male passenger. They turned both over to the Maverick County Sheriff’s Office for further investigation.

One day earlier, officers assigned to International Bridge 1 searched a Chevrolet 2500 pickup truck as it prepared to leave Texas and enter Mexico. During the search, the officers found multiple firearms and ammunition, officials stated.

The firearms included a Smith & Wesson SD40 Crimson Trace pistol, a Winchester 190 .22 caliber rifle, three Smith & Wesson .40 caliber 14-round magazines, one Smith & Wesson Pro Mag .40 caliber 25-round magazine, and 319 rounds of ammunition in varying calibers, officials stated. Officers seized all of the firearms and ammunition.

Officers assigned to the Camino Real Bridge on April 27 searched a GMC 3500 pickup truck. During the inspection, the officers found a Taurus Armas GC2 9 mm pistol and two Pro Cal 9 mm magazines hidden inside a DVD player, officials stated. The officers seized the firearms and issued a $500 penalty.

That same day, CBP officers also seized 28 rounds of .22 caliber ammunition while searching a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck.

“Our frontline officers continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of blending inspection skills and experience with the use of technology in these enforcement actions,” Port Director Paul Del Rincon, Eagle Pass Port of Entry, said in a written statement.

['Bob Price'],2020-05-03,15 Miles of Additional Border Wall Completed in California,"Contractors completed 15 miles of a new border wall system in the El Centro Sector of Southern California, Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott announced. Border Patrol agents who work in the sector told Breitbart Texas previously completed sectors reduced crime in the area and made it safer to patrol.

In a tweet on Friday, U.S. Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott said, “Today, we completed a 15-mile section of border wall system in El Centro Sector that will provide much-needed infrastructure to help USBP agents secure the border.”

Border Security is National Security Today, we completed a 15 mile section of border wall system in El Centro Sector that will provide much needed infrastructure to help USBP agents secure the border.

It is not clear from the announcement if this is a new border wall system, or a replacement for outdated technology. Regardless, the new bollard-style wall provides increased security, technology surveillance, lighting, and all-weather roads to improve the response time of Border Patrol agents to crossings in the area.

Last summer, Breitbart Texas reported that the completion of new border wall construction in the El Sentro Sector made the area safer for agents to patrol and reduced crime in the area.

“We’ve had people throw Molotov cocktails over the old landing mat fence and it was dangerous because we couldn’t see through it like we can with [President Donald Trump’s] new border barrier. Here in El Centro, we have the highest stretch of border wall on the entire Southwest border. Trump’s new wall section is 30-feet high,” Border Patrol Agent Mike Matzke said in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council Local 2554.

“New sections of Trump’s wall have been built and anyone claiming that a 30-foot barrier that replaced a 10-foot high sheet metal fence isn’t new barrier doesn’t know what they are talking about,” the veteran Border Patrol agent explained. “The old legacy landing mat fence in our sector wasn’t effective and really bad people were jumping all day and night.”

“Assaults on Border Patrol agents in the area have dropped 65 percent since Trump built it,” Matzke concluded. “Illegal entries in the area are down 75 percent since Trump built it.”

The new border wall system previously completed in Calexico, California, was the first section of replacement wall to be completed, El Centro Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Joshua C. Devack said in a video presentation in October 2019 and reported by Breitbart Texas.

“Since the border wall system was completed in this area, local business and commerce is thriving and areas once considered dangerous are now secure,” Devack stated. “In addition, overall crime in this area has been significantly reduced thus making our community a safer place to live and work.”

CBP officials report the completion of 175 miles of new border wall systems along the U.S. border with Mexico. In the process, contractors utilized 245,000 tons of steel and 360,000 cubic yards of concrete.

Border Patrol agents previously told Breitbart Texas they like the new bollard walls because they are difficult to climb and provide agents with visibility to what is happening on the Mexican side of the wall.

"['Ildefonso Ortiz', 'Brandon Darby']",2020-05-04,Mexican Health Officials Stop Sharing Coronavirus Case Estimates,"Mexico’s top health officials are now avoiding the practice of estimating and announcing Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases to instead focus on hospital capacity.

During a nightly news conference, Mexico’s Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell released the most current figures that show 23,471 confirmed cases and 2,154 fatalities. Lopez Gatell also minimized the fact that as of April 11, his epidemiologists estimated Mexico had approximately 104,562 cases. The official did not give a current estimate.

In early April, Lopez Gatell explained that Mexico was not engaging in mass testing and would instead develop statistical models which multiplied the number of confirmed cases against a set factor. The factor for several weeks was announced as 8, however, this weekend, Lopez Gatell stated it was a more fluid equation without a standard factor.

During Sunday’s news conference, Lopez Gatell claimed that the estimated number of cases was no longer important and people should instead focus on available bed space in hospitals. Lopez Gatell said “not every person who tests positive for COVID-19 is a confirmed case.”

Lopez Gatell recently admitted that previous case figures from daily reports did not account for private hospital patients. In some states, the number of cases could almost double if private patients were included. States like Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas release their own numbers to reflect all hospitals and show nearly double that of the federal figures.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-05,Wisconsin’s Stay-at-Home Order Challenged in Court for Religious Discrimination,"Two Wisconsin residents sued state and local officials Monday over a stay-at-home order that bans religious gatherings of more than nine people, and all public protests, while allowing larger gatherings in stores and other settings.

The plaintiffs, Jeré Fabick and Larry Chapman, are challenging Emergency Order 28, issued by Gov. Tony Evers and Secretary of Health Services Andrea Palm, arguing that it is “unconstitutional in singling out religious worship and political gatherings for special restrictions.”

Adam Laxalt, the former attorney general of Nevada, who is representing the plaintiffs through the Cooper & Kirk law firm, said in a memorandum released to the media:

As a former Attorney General, I understand that Government needs space to protect its citizens during times like these. While much of Wisconsin’s approach to fighting the pandemic is lawful, the state has clearly overstepped important Constitutional boundaries and has failed to protect its citizens’ fundamental liberties of freedom of conscience, right to assembly and free exercise, and the right to travel.

The filing notes:

While EO 28 permits 60 individuals—ten adult staff and 50 children (who obviously can not be required or expected to be properly masked and distanced)—to gather together in a day care center, it does not allow even ten religious believers (who can be required and expected to observe recognized protective measures) to gather together for worship. While Respondents allow hundreds of customers into Costco at any given time, no group of any size is allowed to assemble in the park, or any other public or private place, to engage in political protest or expression.

The filing also points out the the state’s rule discriminates against Jews in particular, since Orthodox Jews require a quorum of ten men for daily services to be held. “EO 28 operates as a complete ban on the form of worship practiced by some Wisconsinites,” the lawsuit states. “For example, under Jewish law, public prayer and worship may only occur in the presence of a Minyan, or quorum of ten Jewish males over the age of 13.”

The lawsuit follows U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s warning to state and local governments last week that they should not overreach in their stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic, and that the federal government would support challenges to orders that violated constitutional rights.

“[T]he Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis,” Barr wrote in a memorandum to U.S. Attorneys. “We must therefore be vigilant to ensure its protections are preserved, at the same time that the public is protected.”

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-05-05,Committee Calls for End to ‘Silent Slaughter’ of Christians in Nigeria,"The International Committee on Nigeria (ICON) has called for the appointment of U.S. Special Envoy to Nigeria, asserting that the country is failing to provide freedom of religion and basic protections for its citizens.

As “a nonprofit working to secure a future for all Nigerians,” ICON released a statement following the release of the 2020 Annual Report from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which designates Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” for its egregious violations of religious freedom.

In a statement sent to Breitbart News, ICON said that terrorist groups like Boko Haram have perpetrated “unspeakable violence” against unarmed and undefended Christian communities over the past decade, and the persecution has gone from bad to worse, resulting in a “silent slaughter.”

“Tens of thousands of innocent lives have been lost, the vast majority of them women and children,” the group said. “Thousands of churches have been torched. Entire communities, villages, and towns have been devastated. Millions have been kidnapped or displaced from their homes following persecution.”

“In an especially disgusting demonstration of brutality, the same terrorists that have operated unchecked for the last decade are now exploiting this time of crisis,” the committee said. “According to reports, more than 200 innocent lives have been taken already this month. That’s four times more than the number of lives lost to COVID-19.

Much of the anti-Christian violence in Nigeria is perpetrated by Fulani raiders who seek to rid the nation’s middle belt of Christians. According to ICON, statistics on Nigerian deaths suggest that the group is “six times deadlier than Boko Haram.”

ICON also took issue with the way the slaughter of Christians has been addressed by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, who is himself of Fulani ethnicity.

“Not only has President Muhammadu Buhari failed to stop the violence, but attacks against Christians have become more aggressive and deadly under his administration,” the group lamented. “We need to do everything in our power to stop this crisis as soon as possible.”

“USCIRF’s 2020 Report confirms the critical need for U.S. action to stop the killing of innocent people in Nigeria. Specifically, we need to send a Special Envoy to Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region,” the statement reads.

Williams'],2020-05-05,U.S. Bishops: ‘Disproportionate’ Impact of Coronavirus on Black Americans,"Leaders of the U.S. Bishops’ conference (USCCB) have issued a statement denouncing the coronavirus’ “disproportionate” effects on black Americans and the “systemic structural conditions” underlying it.

“Our hearts are wounded for the many souls mourned as African American communities across the nation are being disproportionately infected with and dying from the virus that causes COVID-19,” the bishops state in a May 4 message.

In their communiqué, the bishops suggest that the reason for the disproportionate impact of the virus on the black community relates to entrenched structures of racism in American society.

“We raise our voices to urge state and national leaders to examine the generational and systemic structural conditions that make the new coronavirus especially deadly to African American communities,” they state.

Among the document’s signatories are Bishop Shelton J. Fabre chairman of the USCCB’s Ad Hoc Committee Against Racism, Archbishop Paul S. Coakley, chairman of the Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development, Archbishop Nelson J. Perez, chairman of the Committee on Cultural Diversity in the Church, and Bishop Joseph N. Perry, chairman of the Subcommittee on African American Affairs.

The release of bishops’ statement coincided with the Joe Biden campaign rollout of a broad policy proposal aimed at “rooting out systemic racism from our laws, our policies, our institutions, and our hearts.”

“The truth is, African Americans can never have a fair shot at the American Dream so long as entrenched disparities are still allowed to chip away at opportunity,” Mr. Biden wrote in a statement Monday announcing his “Lift Every Voice” proposal.

“The data we’ve seen so far suggests that African Americans are dying from COVID-19 at a far higher rate than whites,” Biden stated, and “the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 have exposed — and cruelly exacerbated — the disparities long faced by African Americans.”

Blacks in the U.S. “are less likely to have a job they can do from home, forcing them to make the difficult choice between their health and a paycheck,” Biden noted.

“Long-standing systemic inequalities may also be contributing to this disparity — including the fact that African Americans are more likely to be uninsured,” he said.

[],2020-05-05,Rays Minor Leaguer Learned of Family’s Murder on Facebook,"DANVILLE, Va. (AP) — Tampa Bay Rays minor leaguer Blake Bivens says he learned through social media of the deaths of three family members last summer.

Speaking publicly for what is believed to be the first time about the Aug. 28 deaths of wife Emily, 1-year-old son Culle and mother-in-law Joan Bernard, Bivens recalled details of traveling home to Keeling, Virginia, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he had been on a road trip with the Rays’ Double-A Montgomery affiliate.

The 24-year-old pitcher’s brother-in-law, Matthew Bernard, was arrested, charged with three counts of murder and is awaiting trial.

Bivens spoke for more than 30 minutes Sunday with interim senior pastor Travis Gore of The River Church during a conversation aired live on Facebook.

The athlete said his faith has helped him cope with the deaths.

“The only thing I really remember from the whole plane ride is I just went through periods. I just stared at the back of the seat the whole time, trying to get my mind to wrap around what I’m hearing,” Bivens said.

“It’s almost kind of like, `This isn’t really happening.’ I was more in a state of shock. I would go through periods of shaking,” he said. “Then I would start to lose it a little bit and break down and cry. It was kind of like a circle. The plane rides just seemed like they took forever.”

Bivens said he initially feared something was wrong when he awakened that day and had not received a text message from his wife.

The concern grew when he couldn’t reach her and he learned on Facebook that his brother-in-law was being sought by police. He returned to social media, searching for information, while sitting in the Chattanooga airport.

“First headline I see is two females and a small child were gone. I immediately knew that was them,” Bivens said. “I found out my family was gone over a Facebook headline. I just immediately began to scream in the middle of the airport.”

The pitcher said the trip home “could have been a whole lot worse for me” if he had not been accompanied by three members of the Rays organization, including Montgomery manager Morgan Ensberg.

“I think the hardest moment for me was when I got home and I walked in my son’s bedroom for the first time and realized I was never going to see him on this earth again,” Bivens said. “That was the worst moment in my life. Nothing ever will come to feeling the way I felt at that moment.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/05/rays-minor-leaguer-learned-of-familys-murder-on-facebook/

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-05,"Brett Favre Paid $1.1 Million in Mississippi Welfare Funds for Speeches He Didn’t Attend, Audit Says","Former Green Bay Packers quarterback and NFL legend Brett Favre, was paid $1.1 million in Mississippi welfare funds to deliver speeches that he never attended, according to a recent audit of the Mississippi Department of Human Services.

As the Mississippi Clarion Ledger reports, Favre was paid in two installments totaling $1.1 million for speaking engagements, autograph signings, appearances, and promotions. According the Ledger, it was learned that Favre “did not speak nor was he present for those events.”

The audit revealed more than $94 million in questionable disbursements by the Mississippi DHS.

Favre will reportedly not face criminal charges over the scandal, but others will, Pro Football Talk reports.

Mississippi State auditor Shad White said that the report “shows the most egregious misspending my staff have seen in their careers at the Office of the State Auditor.” White added, “if there was a way to misspend money, it seems DHS leadership or their grantees thought of it and tried it.”

Brett Favre was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in 2016. He threw for nearly 72,000 yards over a 20-year career spent with the Falcons, Packers, Jets, and Vikings.

['Kyle Morris'],2020-05-04,Massachusetts Golf Course to Reopen During Lockdown,"As small business owners around the country suffer the economic wrath of COVID-19, with some state governments refusing to allow them to resume operation, one country club in Massachusetts is planning on defying the state order.

Cara Cullen, along with other members of the Marroney family, has owned Wachusett Country Club in West Boylston, Massachusetts, since 1939. The family has also owned Kettle Brook Golf Club in Paxton, MA, since 2008. Cullen spoke with Breitbart News about the decision she is weighing as to when to reopen for business and defy the state’s order.

Asked during a call with Breitbart News on Monday if she intends to reopen despite the governor’s lockdown order, she said yes she does and is working out the details of how to do so now.

According to Cullen, there seems to be a “general consensus” among golf clubs in the area to defy the state government’s order and reopen for business, saying, “We don’t have a choice” and that they have “nothing to lose at this point.” Cullen said she believes that if golf courses are not reopened soon, she believes most in the Central Massachusetts area will “go under.”

“We have sat back and remained patient while 48 states have opened up golf,” Cullen said before she mentioned that several from the state are traveling to other states to play golf during the state’s lockdown. “That to me is such a hazardous situation to have thousands of golfers crossing the borders to New York and Connecticut every single day to golf. I mean how many times have they brought the virus back?”

Cullen placed blame on the state’s governor, Charlie Baker, for refusing to allow golf courses in the state to reopen, saying he has created a “hazardous condition” that forces people to travel to other states.

Cullen also called out the behavior in other stores across the state like Walmart, saying there is “barely any social distancing” and people are “flocking to Home Depot, Target, Walmart, to alleviate their boredom and frustration.”

“There is no way you can tell me that what goes on down at Walmart is safer than opening a golf course,” Cullen said, adding that they are at “wits’ end.”

Asked about the economic impact of the closure, Cullen said she lost her mother-in-law in March to the coronavirus. “If I thought for a minute that it would be unsafe, I would never do it and I would take the economic hit,” Cullen said in regards to reopening. “I do understand how important and real this virus is… This weekend we would have taken in $30,000 at each golf course.”

“Governor Baker has no problem endangering the lives of all these essential employees of Stop and Shop, Home Depot, and Target, but we can’t open golf courses because it’s unsafe,” Cullen reiterated. “If he really thinks golf is not safe, then he should tell Massachusetts people right now that they cannot cross the border to golf in other states.”

Cullen pointed out that her customers are working-class, blue-collar Americans, including “firefighters, police officers, electricians, and plumbers.” She also discussed the rise of mental health issues Americans face, mentioning that 48 other states understand that outdoor recreation is essential.

“Every single aspect of opening will help the safety of what’s going on as far as stopping people from crossing the borders, stopping people from flocking to the essential stores that are open, and allowing people an outlet for their mental health and physical health,” Cullen said.

“We can’t just close up and wait it out,” Cullen continued. “If you don’t maintain a golf course, within weeks it would no longer be a golf course and you could never get it back to its original condition.”

“We’re using thousands of dollars of chemicals and treatments, every single day we are out mowing and cutting and there is no revenue coming in,” Cullen added.

During the interview, Cullen stated that she had been in recent conversations with the state government in hopes of getting the course reopened, but they failed to deliver. She said she believes the lockdown extension until May 18 is a “delay tactic.” Cullen said she joined a call recently with Lt. Governor Karyn Polito to discuss the possibility of reopening golf courses in the state. Cullen said the conversation sounded “very promising,” but it was halted on Monday with no expected reopening date given to Cullen.

Should they decide to reopen, Cullen talked about safety measures she would implement to ensure that the course remains safe for those who utilize it, which included pins for hands-free ball removal, one rider per cart, cart sanitation, masks for employees, closures of course buildings (food, etc.), and golfers to have to wait in their car until ten minutes before tee time.

“I think it’s lazy, I think it’s petty, and I think it’s not looking out for the small businesses,” Cullen concluded.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/04/massachusetts-country-club-mulls-possibility-of-reopening-during-lockdown/

['Katherine Rodriguez'],2020-05-04,Two Men Found Dead on NYC Subway,"Two men who were believed to be homeless were found dead on the New York City subway trains in less than 24 hours this past weekend.

The first incident took place Friday night at the 168th St. station in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. The New York Police Department (NYPD) said that transit workers discovered a dead 56-year-old man on a C train while at the station.

The second incident took place Saturday morning around 8:20 a.m., when a rider called 911 after finding an unresponsive body. When emergency medical services (EMS) responders arrived, they found 61-year-old Robert Mangual dead on the floor of the 4 train at Brooklyn’s Utica Avenue station.

A spokesperson for the city medical examiner’s office said Monday that a cause of death has not been determined for either man.

In a similar incident last month, a 62-year-old man was found dead on a subway train near the Astoria section of Queens.

Subway ridership has gone down more than 90 percent due to the coronavirus, but there has been an increase in homeless people using subway cars as a shelter during the pandemic.

This has prompted the city to shut down its subways between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. starting May 6 for disinfecting.

['Amy Furr'],2020-05-04,Drive-In Movie Theater Previously Deemed 'Non-Essential' to Open Friday,"A drive-in movie theater in McHenry, Illinois, received the go-ahead Sunday to open for business after it was labeled nonessential during the coronavirus pandemic.

Sunday, the McHenry Outdoor Theater owner, Scott Dehn, said they would begin the season Friday and Saturday night thanks to their many supporters, according to a Facebook post.

The post read:

You came together as a single voice in an effort to help us open. Your efforts are a true testament as to what can be accomplished when people work together towards a common goal. Imagine if we all did that across all areas of our lives. You are all amazing. When things got tough, I found myself browsing through your comments on my Facebook posts. You never lost hope and your supportive comments gave me the inspiration to keep on trying. Thank you.

Although he satisfied all the state’s guidelines, Dehn said officials told him at the last minute he could not open the theater on May 1 because it was a nonessential business.

“I remain hopeful that something good will come of this. I noticed that there was even a petition making the rounds on social media with over 7,800 signatures! I mean, WOW… That is amazing,” he wrote on Facebook.

['Amy Furr'],2020-05-04,Drive-In Movie Theater Previously Deemed 'Non-Essential' to Open Friday,"A drive-in movie theater in McHenry, Illinois, received the go-ahead Sunday to open for business after it was labeled nonessential during the coronavirus pandemic.

Sunday, the McHenry Outdoor Theater owner, Scott Dehn, said they would begin the season Friday and Saturday night thanks to their many supporters, according to a Facebook post.

The post read:

You came together as a single voice in an effort to help us open. Your efforts are a true testament as to what can be accomplished when people work together towards a common goal. Imagine if we all did that across all areas of our lives. You are all amazing. When things got tough, I found myself browsing through your comments on my Facebook posts. You never lost hope and your supportive comments gave me the inspiration to keep on trying. Thank you.

['Katherine Rodriguez'],2020-05-04,Three Platypuses Returned Back into Wild After Australian Bushfire Crisis,"Three platypuses at the center of an emergency evacuation during Australia’s scorching bushfire season have been released back into their natural habitat.

Rescuers transported the animals from Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve near Canberra to Sydney’s Taronga Zoo this past December, while bushfires ran rampant, and their watery habitats came close to dissolving due to the extreme drought, the Australian Broadcasting Company reported.

Dr. Phoebe Meagher with the Taronga Zoo said researchers had to act quickly because the bushfires were predicted to sweep the area in a matter of days.

“With the help of the University of New South Wales, we got out the nets and the tinny — and we managed to save seven platypus from the drying creeks,” she said.

Recent rainfall in the area means it is now safe for the platypuses to return to their habitat at the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.

“We’ve had lots of rain, the creeks are full, and there’s lots of food available,” Dr. Meagher said.

A video of conservation workers releasing the platypuses in the wild showed that the animals did not leave the zoo empty-handed.

The returned platypuses have been outfitted with some high-tech trackers to better understand their movements and behaviors of a species that is elusive and going extinct.

Dr. Meagher said a second group of platypuses would be returned to the wild in the coming weeks.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2020/05/04/three-platypuses-returned-back-wild-after-australian-bushfire-crisis/

['Oliver Jj Lane'],2020-05-05,Coronavirus: Wages of over Half of UK Adults Now Paid by British State,"Almost a quarter of all British employees have been ‘furloughed’ in two weeks, meaning over half of the British adult population is now being paid by the government, possibly the highest proportion ever.

The UK government announced the coronavirus job retention scheme, a state-funded programme where businesses slowing or suspending operations during the national lockdown could avoid firing their staff, in March. Rather than employees being laid off and shuffled onto the government’s unemployed claimant count, the government would instead pay employers to keep paying wages even though the furloughed staff were not doing any actual work.

Uptake of the programme was enormous, and perhaps greater than expected, with 800,000 employers nationwide signing up to the scheme, placing 6.3 million people onto the government payroll at a cost of around £8 billion, the Treasury said. The bill for keeping essentially unemployed people in their jobs was so large, it is now costing the British taxpayer the same amount that it spends on the NHS, the chancellor revealed.

The Job Retention Scheme launched on 20 April. By midnight 3 May a total of: ➡️ 6.3m jobs furloughed *

➡️ 800K employers furloughing **

➡️ Total value of claims £8bn Apply for a grant to cover the wages of your furloughed staff now: https://t.co/bx1Nszshsr pic.twitter.com/29n9h0RB2k — HM Revenue & Customs (@HMRCgovuk) May 4, 2020

In normal times the number of people earning a wage in private business significantly outweighs those in the government sector, but with almost a quarter of all employed people becoming state-paid in just a couple of weeks, the balance has tipped, judging by historic employment trend data, for the first time in British history.

Between the 6.3 million newly furloughed staff, and over 20 million people either received a state pension or government benefits, there are now more people on the government payroll than private, according to an analysis by British newspaper the Daily Telegraph. The proportion is a significant rise on any other period in modern British history, including times of high government interaction with the workforce including the two World Wars where millions of Britons were under arms, or during the late-1970s highwater of state ownership of industry, or during the early 1980s and ’90s crashes.

The difference also throws into sharp contrast the difference wrought by a century of so-called social democracy and government growth. While in 2020 under the coronavirus emergency over 50 per cent of the adult population is in the employment of the state, in 1920 less than eight per cent were in receipt of tax money.

Speaking on Monday evening to British television news network ITN, chancellor Rishi Sunak, who initiated the furlough scheme, reflected that the trend was “clearly not a sustainable situation” and the government was working to wind down the programme. Yet businesses warned if the supply of government money — due to run out in June — was turned off too soon, they would simply make their suspended employees redundant.

Mr Sunak said: “There will be no cliff edge to the furlough scheme. I am working as we speak to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and to ease people back into work in a measured way. But as some scenarios have suggested, we are potentially spending as much on the furlough scheme as we do on the NHS, for example. Now clearly, that is not a sustainable situation.

['Kurt Zindulka'],2020-05-05,Brexit's Nigel Farage Visited by Police Over Illegal Boat Migrant Reporting,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage was visited by police officers Monday, warning him to observe the “essential travel” rules after he reported on illegal boat migrants arriving in Dover.

On Monday, Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage went to the port at Dover and filmed the Border Force bringing a group of migrants “including a very young baby” to shore.

Yet after continuing his work as a politician-turned-journalist to expose the “scandal” of Britain’s borders remaining open at a time where the rest of the country is closed, Mr Farage said that “two police officers just knocked on my door to advise me on essential travel.”

“They had received a complaint that I had been to Dover to report on the illegal migrant scandal taking place,” Farage said, adding: “What a total waste of time and money.”

The national lockdown measures that were imposed on the country allow exceptions to the restriction of movement for certain key workers including “journalists and broadcasters who are providing public service broadcasting.”

Police forces across the country have been accused of overzealous enforcement of the national lockdown. Last week, it was revealed that the Crown Prosecution Service will review every charge, conviction, and sentence that have been brought under the Coronavirus Act following a string of wrongful convictions.

Lockdown lunacy. Two police officers just knocked on my door to advise me on essential travel. They had received a complaint that I had been to Dover to report on the illegal migrant scandal taking place. What a total waste of time and money. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) May 4, 2020

In his film at Dover, Mr Farage blamed the inaction of the Home Office for the growing “scandal” of illegal boat migrants landing on British shores during the Chinese coronavirus crisis.

“The Border Force is supposed to protect our borders, not be a taxi service for illegal immigrants and yet that’s what the Home Office are telling them what to do,” Mr Farage said.

Mr Farage lamented the “enormous risks people are taking”, but cautioned that it should be remembered that all of this is “organised by criminal trafficking gangs”.

“Remember that even if some of these people qualify as refugees, you claim refugee status in the first safe country you come to. France is a safe country, and I do just get the feeling that we are being so weak about this… that if already over a thousand people have come this year… goodness knows what this figure is going to be,” the Brexit Party leader added.

“If we get a calm summer, they are going to start coming in much much bigger vessels, and we’ve got to get a grip on this,” Mr Farage warned.

The veteran political campaigner, who also serves as an ad hoc journalist as the host of his own LBC radio programme, was following up previous reporting from the beaches of East Sussex, where he interviewed locals who said illegal migrants met and sea or received onshore are just the tip of the iceberg, with some landing entirely undetected, unnoticed by the authorities and unreported by the press. Speaking from East Sussex, Mr Farage said: “This scandal, I think, is far bigger than anyone realises… Not one, to my knowledge, has been returned [to France] and [home secretary] Priti Patel needs to get tough.”

This earned criticism in certain quarters of the mainstream media, with Sunday Times journalist Sarah Baxter, in particular, chastising him for continuing to pursue an issue — mass immigration — with, she claimed, had now gone “right off the boil”.

“I wonder, who is out of touch here? Is it me, or is it the mainstream media?” Farage asked at the time.

On Sunday, the Border Force stopped 49 migrants attempting to cross the English Channel in three rubber dinghies, bringing them ashore at Dover. On Monday, an additional 16 migrants — claiming to be from Iraq and Iran — were brought ashore.

Meanwhile, the UK’s French counterparts stopped an additional 39 migrants on Sunday and a further 39 migrants on Monday before they were able to enter British territorial waters, meaning that over 130 migrants had set sail from France in the span of two days, the BBC reports.

Last week, Home Secretary Priti Patel spoke to her French counterpart about returning more migrants to France. However, there has been no indication from the British government that it intends to turn away migrants at the border.

Last year, 1,890 illegal boat migrants reached British shores, but the British government only deported 125 of them, despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s promise to send migrants back.

['Kurt Zindulka'],2020-05-05,MI6: UK Government Was 'Fully Aware' of China’s Corona-Cover-up,"The British government was made “fully aware” of what was “really happening” in China during the early stages of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, unnamed intelligence officials claim.

Anonymous sources, allegedly from within MI6 — the UK’s equivalent to the CIA — claim that intelligence officials had informed government ministers “not to believe Beijing’s claims” about the true scale of the pandemic.

“We didn’t believe these figures coming from China. The Government would have been fully aware of the true scale of the virus in China at that time,” an MI6 source is said to have told The Telegraph.

“The intelligence community would have known what was really happening in China. The idea that the UK would have taken Chinese figures at face value is frankly ridiculous. If the Chinese are lying, the role of the intelligence community is to know what the real figures might be if they are being hidden,” a former senior intelligence official added.

Despite this, the government refused to shut down travel from China or from any other country during the pandemic, with an estimated 15,000 people arriving per day through British airports. The government also continued to use the reported death toll numbers coming from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during Downing Street’s daily “global death comparison” until April.

China Lied, People Died: Five Eyes Report Details CCP Coronavirus Cover-up https://t.co/sHLCxA7ZRt — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020

The revelations from the unnamed MI6 sources follow an intelligence leak from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zeeland, that detailed the scale of the CCP coronavirus cover-up.

The report also detailed the possibility that the virus emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which it concluded had been working on coronaviruses in bats, with one strain being a 96 per cent genetic match to the COVID-19 virus that sparked a global pandemic.

The Chinese embassy in London refuted the claims that the virus emerged from the Wuhan lab, saying in a statement: “There is no evidence showing the virus came from a lab. Rumour-mongering, as well as slander and smear, will only damage international solidarity.”

The British conservative think-tank, the Henry Jackson Society revealed images from the institute, which purportedly displayed the “dangerous safety standards” at the Wuhan lab. However, it is not clear what the workers in the images were doing or whether protective gear was required.

The director of the Asia Studies Centre at the think tank, Matthew Henderson said: “Given what we now know about lax biosecurity standards, it is at the very least plausible that human error at a virology lab contributed to the spread of the pandemic.”

“Since Beijing refuses independent access to these sites, their records and their research, why should we think otherwise?” Henderson questioned.

['Simon Kent'],2020-05-05,Australian Lawmakers Call to Slash Immigration in Post-Coronavirus World,"Australian lawmakers of all political stripes have joined a call to slash migrant numbers after the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, arguing the country’s historic reliance on new arrivals to boost growth has hurt workers while driving soaring house prices and crowded cities.

Their push addresses concerns many Australian employers use the current temporary visa system to avoid hiring local workers and were exploiting people whose visa status and security depended on their wage provider.

“Do we want migrants to return to Australia in the same numbers and in the same composition as before the crisis?” Labor Party parliamentary member Kristina Keneally wrote in an opinion piece. “Our answer should be no.”

In particular, she called for a reduction in the number of young, lower-skilled temporary workers permitted to enter the country and more investment in skills training for locals at a time when more than a quarter of Australia’s population is foreign born, the second largest in the OECD.

“We must make sure that Australians get a fair go and a first go at jobs,” Keneally outlined in the Sun-Herald and the Sunday Age newspapers.

“Our post-Covid-19 economic recovery must ensure Australia shifts away from its increasing reliance on a cheap supply of overseas, temporary labour that undercuts wages for Australian workers and takes jobs Australians could do.”

A member of the ruling conservative coalition, Andrew Laming, agreed. He said there was scope to increase the skill-based element of the migrant intake, arguing it was vital to focus on “quality rather than quantity”.

Senator Dean Smith has also raised concerns about immigration, saying Australia deserves a more comprehensive debate in the wake of the pandemic.

“Any plan to reshape Australia once the coronavirus has passed must start with a conversation about the composition, geographic spread and the skill components of our population,” he said.

The current immigration debate in Australia’s parliament is a continuation of one that began in earnest even before the Chinese coronavirus epidemic took hold, as Breitbart News reported.

In January, soaring house prices and crowded cities combined to convince a clear majority of Australians the country’s open door immigration push must end.

Just 30.4 per cent of Australians now believe the country needs more people, according to a poll conducted by the Australian National University (ANU).

This was compared to 69.6 per cent who felt Australia did not need more people, a dramatic increase since a similar poll was done in 2010.

The collapse in support was most prominent among males with just 32.8 percent supporting a bigger Australia compared to 53.4 percent in the 2010 poll.

Most Australians support the notion of cultural diversity but did not want population growth to come at the expense of the quality of life of the majority, according to the survey.

The results confirm previous calls by local politicians for the country’s conservative coalition government to end mass migration.

Australia’s current population growth is the largest it has experienced since colonisation.

In 1981 the Australian population was around 14.9 million people. By June 2018 it had reached 25.0 million, with the last five million of that growth occurring since December 2004.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in 2018 he intended to cut Australia’s permanent migration intake by about 30,000 people, citing public concern about congested cities.

“They are saying: enough, enough, enough,” Morrison told the 2018 Bradfield Oration.

In December last year immigration was again at the forefront of national debate when the Department of Home Affairs declared social cohesion must be at the forefront of any future decisions on migrant intakes.

This includes cautioning migrants they must fully embrace Australian values, including learning English, while pledging allegiance to the country that will be their new home, as Breitbart News reported.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/australian-lawmakers-call-to-slash-mass-immigration-in-post-coronavirus-world/
['Simon Kent'],2020-05-05,Australian Lawmakers Call to Slash Immigration in Post-Coronavirus World,"Australian lawmakers of all political stripes have joined a call to slash migrant numbers after the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, arguing the country’s historic reliance on new arrivals to boost growth has hurt workers while driving soaring house prices and crowded cities.

Their push addresses concerns many Australian employers use the current temporary visa system to avoid hiring local workers and were exploiting people whose visa status and security depended on their wage provider.

“Do we want migrants to return to Australia in the same numbers and in the same composition as before the crisis?” Labor Party parliamentary member Kristina Keneally wrote in an opinion piece. “Our answer should be no.”

In particular, she called for a reduction in the number of young, lower-skilled temporary workers permitted to enter the country and more investment in skills training for locals at a time when more than a quarter of Australia’s population is foreign born, the second largest in the OECD.

“We must make sure that Australians get a fair go and a first go at jobs,” Keneally outlined in the Sun-Herald and the Sunday Age newspapers.

“Our post-Covid-19 economic recovery must ensure Australia shifts away from its increasing reliance on a cheap supply of overseas, temporary labour that undercuts wages for Australian workers and takes jobs Australians could do.”

A member of the ruling conservative coalition, Andrew Laming, agreed. He said there was scope to increase the skill-based element of the migrant intake, arguing it was vital to focus on “quality rather than quantity”.

Senator Dean Smith has also raised concerns about immigration, saying Australia deserves a more comprehensive debate in the wake of the pandemic.

“Any plan to reshape Australia once the coronavirus has passed must start with a conversation about the composition, geographic spread and the skill components of our population,” he said.

['Jack Montgomery'],2020-05-04,Left-wing Politician Charged with Vote-by-Mail Fraud,"Local politician Israr Rashid has been charged with a number of vote-by-mail offences in High Wycombe, England.

Rashid won the Totteridge and Bowerdean seat on Buckingham County Council in a by-election on February 7th, securing 40.8 per cent of the vote on a turnout of 30.21 per cent — far ahead of his nearest competitor, independent candidate Matt Knight, on 27.8 per cent of vote, or the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates, on 21.2 per cent and 10.2 per cent of the vote.

Rashid had originally been the Labour candidate for the seat — and is described as having been the Labour candidate in the Buckingham County Council news bulletin announcing the outcome of the election — but, according to the Bucks Free Press, the left-wing party “suspended” him just days before the vote was held.

The local news outlet now reports that he has been charged with “conspiracy to defraud the electoral services manager at Wycombe District Council by dishonestly causing or permitting to be submitted to the officer postal voting statements which contained false particulars”, as well as “two counts of committing, aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring in the commission of voting by post as some other person.”

Rashid’s lawyer submitted not guilty pleas via Skype on his behalf at Aylesbury Crown Court, whose proceedings have been disrupted by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Judge Francis Sheridan said a trial for the politician would be organised as swiftly as possible, warning that “If [Rashid] does not turn up for trial, it will be held in his absence” and imposing a number of bail conditions preventing him from contacting certain people or coming within 100 feet of certain addresses, to prevent “interference” with witnesses.

['Frances Martel'],2020-05-05,North Korea Says 'Fake News Rampant in South Korea',"The North Korean propaganda website Meari published an article condemning South Korea’s free press for unspecified “fake news” on Tuesday following weeks of speculation over the health of communist dictator Kim Jong-un.

Kim did not make any public appearances for weeks since April 11, notably choosing not to attend a ceremony for the “Day of the Sun,” grandfather Kim Il-sung’s birthday and North Korea’s most important holiday. His absence resulted in widespread, anonymous reports claiming that Kim had either died, become “brain dead,” been seriously injured in a missile attack, suffered a major cardiovascular health episode, or had contracted the Chinese coronavirus.

On Friday, North Korean state media published images of a man they claimed to be Kim cutting a ribbon at a ceremony celebrating the construction of a fertilizer plant. The videos and photos allegedly of Kim were the first anyone had seen of him since April 11 and appeared to confirm that he was healthy, able to walk and talk, and in command of the country.

South Korea’s Yonhap news agency translated the comments in Meari, which notably did not mention Kim Jong-un himself or any of the rumors relating to his health recently.

“Fake news that has been rampant in South Korea is putting people in a state of confusion,” Meari claimed, blaming “conservative media” for much of the reporting. While conservative newspapers like Dong-A Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo published some reports on Kim’s health, the most prominent reports claiming Kim was in danger came from left-wing outlets like CNN. The state propaganda outlet claimed that South Korean media was engaged in the act of “manipulating public opinion by intentionally fabricating false facts about a specific subject or group with a view to pursuing certain political and economic objectives.” It reportedly did not identify any subject or group in particular. Elsewhere in North Korean state media, outlets focused on the construction of the Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory, which Kim visited for the ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday. Rather than discuss Kim himself, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) hailed the “wonderful construction” of the factory. “The scientists, technicians and builders of the country built the modern phosphatic fertilizer production base tantamount to establishing a new industrial field despite the vicious sanctions and pressure from the hostile forces and the disastrous spread of the malignant virus worldwide,” KCNA applauded on Monday, one of several regular mentions of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. North Korea claims to have identified zero cases of coronavirus despite being bordered by three of the world’s most affected countries: its origin nation, China; Russia; and South Korea. KCNA reiterated that Kim was present this weekend at the site, claiming he “learned in detail about the construction which was in a standstill due to various bottlenecks in the early stage of the construction and saw to it that an audacious operation was unfolded to build the factory our own way to be perfect one.” On Tuesday, Rodong Sinmun, the state newspaper, continued its usual stream of communist agitprop.

“The materialization of the dream and ideal of our people and triumphant advance of socialism depend on living our own way,” a column in the North Korean outlet read. “Even in the worst adversity in which others would be disrupted a hundred times, the red flag of socialism have been fluttering on this land generation after generation and the DPRK [North Korea] has been demonstrating its might as a great independent power, impregnable socialist fortress.”

Despite publishing significant volumes of material in the past week, the “fake news” diatribe has been the closest that North Korean state media has gotten to addressing the Kim health rumors. The gossip report that elevated discussion of Kim’s disappearance internationally appeared last month in CNN, citing anonymous sources who claimed that Kim was suffering from heart disease and was in “grave danger” after a surgical procedure. That report prompted NBC News’ Katy Tur to claim that Kim was “brain dead” on Twitter, then delete the claim.

Other reports suggested that Kim was struggling to overcome infection of the Chinese coronavirus, potentially the product of a meeting with Chinese doctors on other health issues. Yet other reports claimed that Kim had not been infected but had been exposed to the virus, necessitating quarantine. Kim could not publicly announce quarantine when the government claimed no cases of coronavirus had occurred in the country.

A report in Dong-A Ilbo also suggested, again citing anonymous sources, that Kim had been injured in a missile test and could not appear in public without revealing the injury. Two newly-elected South Korean lawmakers said, respectively, that Kim was dead or that Kim could not walk properly from a health condition. The two have since apologized profusely; media outlets who reported the other rumors have largely not done the same.

North Korea has also not remarked on a bizarre incident this weekend following Kim’s reemergence in which North Korean soldiers fired across the border into the South. South Korea reported no injuries or deaths and dismissed the incident. American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said this weekend Washington believes the shots fired to be “accidental.” Radio Free Asia (RFA) quoted some observers, however, who believed the shots to be a message that North Korea did not intend to change its hostile policies against Seoul.

Many reports indicated that Kim spent much of his absence in Wonsan, a northern port city he has invested heavily in towards making a seaside resort. Kim’s family train appeared to be in the city in satellite images, and other surveillance showed movement of Kim’s fleet of yachts there. Sunchon, where the fertilizer factory is located, is easily reachable within a day’s time from Wonsan.

['Simon Kent'],2020-05-05,W.H.O. Rejects Claims Wuhan Lab Spawned Coronavirus Epidemic,"The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) on Monday sided with the Chinese Communist Party and rejected claims by Washington that a secretive laboratory in the southern China city of Wuhan spawned the global coronavirus epidemic.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday in an interview with ABC there was “enormous evidence” Covid-19 originated in the lab.

This followed the revelation the intelligence community has not yet ruled out that the coronavirus accidentally escaped from the lab in Wuhan, where scientists were studying bat coronaviruses.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a rare statement addressing the matter on Thursday, as Breitbart News reported.

“The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,” it said.

But the administration had not produced evidence publicly or provided it to the W.H.O., said its emergencies director, Dr Michael Ryan. “So from our perspective, this remains speculative.

“Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,” Ryan told a virtual briefing, stressing this was “a very important piece of public health information for future control”.

“If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the W.H.O. to operate in an information vacuum in that regard.”

Ryan did not reveal if indeed the W.H.O. had carried out any investigations of its own or questioned the Chinese administration over the origins of the deadly pandemic.

Instead Ryan said it was important for the W.H.O. to learn from Chinese scientists’ data and exchange knowledge to “find the answers together”, but cautioned against politicising the issue.

“If this is projected as aggressive investigation of wrongdoing, that is much more difficult to deal with. That’s a political issue,” he said.

Chinese state media attacked the U.S. claims, with the state broadcaster CCTV labelling them “insane and evasive” in a Monday opinion piece entitled “Evil Pompeo is wantonly spewing poison and spreading lies”.

The Chinese Communist Party-backed Global Times also published an editorial accusing Pompeo and Trump of “bluffing”, and said if the U.S. had evidence it should present it.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/05/05/w-h-o-backs-china-rejects-claim-wuhan-lab-spawned-coronavirus-epidemic/

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-05-05,China Orders Christian Church to Discontinue Online Worship,"The Chinese communist party has ordered the Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) to cease all online worship services, in its latest crackdown on Christianity in the country.

In late 2018, Chinese authorities carried out a series of tightly coordinated raids on the 5,000-member Early Rain Covenant Church in the city of Chengdu, arresting more than 100 members, including Pastor Wang Yi and his wife.

The government cut the phone line to the church and Chinese police reportedly tracked down church members using the location signals from their mobile phones. Pastor Wang later received a sentence of nine years in prison for “inciting subversion” and running an illegal “business.”

China’s state-run Global Times newspaper argued at the time that Wang was not a true Christian but an agitator “brainwashed by Western values.”

Since the shuttering of their church, Early Rain members have had to resort to online streamed worship services, but now the government wants to stop those as well, the Christian Post reported Monday.

Last weekend, police brought in members of ERCC in charge of church activities and online services and demanded that they bring a halt to all activities. One of those detained was Ran Yunfei, who had been scheduled to give a testimony during a church service. Police allowed him to return home only after the service had ended.

As Breitbart News reported, on Easter Sunday, police from the Public Security Bureau raided the homes of ERCC members, arresting six church leaders for participating in an online worship service via Zoom.

“At that time I was also in the Zoom call, but there was a long period of time where I did not hear a thing,” one church member said. “I thought it’s the network connection issue at first, but I soon heard a quarrel erupt. Our co-worker Wang Jun was questioning some people, ‘Who are you to do this [to us]?’”

The Easter service included a taped sermon given by imprisoned Pastor Wang, which apparently sparked the raids. One church member, Zhang Jiangqing, said that police came to his house and threatened harsh treatment if he continues to listen to Wang’s sermons.

“Don’t participate in already banned [religious] activities anymore! Don’t listen to Pastor [Wang]’s sermons anymore! If you do this again, we will deal with it seriously and take you away!” Zhang said.

In its 2020 report released last week, the U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said that religious freedom conditions in China “continued to deteriorate” in 2019.

“The Chinese government has created a high-tech surveillance state, utilizing facial recognition and artificial intelligence to monitor religious minorities,” it noted.

Commissioner Johnnie Moore said there was no doubt that China is “the world’s foremost violator of human rights and religious freedom.”

“It cannot be compared to any other country in the world not only because of its inexcusable actions, but because of the way it aids and abets similar actions by other countries all around the world,” Moore said.

USCIRF recommended that the U.S. government “intensify efforts to counter Chinese government influence operations in the United States that are designed to suppress information about or advocacy in response to violations of religious freedom in China.”

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-05,Nigeria: Doctors Go on Strike over Insufficient Coronavirus Protection,"Medical doctors in Nigeria began a strike on Monday over a lackluster welfare package that included an “inadequate response” from the government to the increased health risks posed by the country’s worsening Chinese coronavirus outbreak, the nation’s Daily Trust reported.

Yesterday, the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in southwestern Nigeria’s Ogun State announced the start of a three-day warning strike effective from Monday over the deficient welfare package. ARD said the strike action followed the alleged refusal of the state government to respond to concerns over the need for an improved welfare package for its members.

“There has been no commitment whatsoever from the government on the issue of appropriate remuneration, entry-level, new minimum wage, hazard allowance, and life insurance for our members,” the association said in a letter to the state governor.

“Despite the inadequate response of Ogun State government to the health risks confronted by our members during this COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic, our members went ahead to continue their work diligently in their various departments and at the isolation center,” the letter said.

“We were taken aback by the arbitrary change in only hazard allowance to be given as COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] Special Hazard Allowance to all health workers,” ARD added.

The association condemned the increase in hazard allowance from N5,000 [$12.82] to N10,000 [$25.64] as “a mere charade.”

As Africa’s top oil producer, Nigeria’s economy has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which has decreased global oil demand. And as Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria faces a potentially devastating coronavirus outbreak, which has been quietly intensifying in recent weeks.

On May 1, in northwestern Nigeria’s Kano state, the number of new coronavirus cases nearly tripled over a few days, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported last Friday.

The Nigeria Center for Disease Control said the number of recorded infections across Kano rose to 219 on May 1, up from 77 at the start of last week.

This report followed shortly after news that over 150 people died in Kano from a “strange ailment” over a two-day period from April 17-18. Nigerian authorities failed to confirm whether this mystery illness was the Chinese coronavirus, but the report fueled speculation that the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Kano and in Nigeria far exceed the numbers released by the government.

Yesterday, the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in southwestern Nigeria’s Ogun State announced the start of a three-day warning strike effective from Monday over the deficient welfare package. ARD said the strike action followed the alleged refusal of the state government to respond to concerns over the need for an improved welfare package for its members.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-04,Tanzania: President Reveals 'Imported' Test Kits Give False Results,"Tanzanian President John Magufuli denounced imported coronavirus test kits as faulty after he said they returned positive results for samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw, a fruit similar to papaya, Reuters reported on Sunday.

The testing kits had “technical errors,” Magufuli said during an event in Chato in northwestern Tanzania on Sunday. The president added that the coronavirus testing kits had been imported from abroad but did not say from where.

Magufuli said he told Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the imported kits. They randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a sheep, a goat, and a papaya, but assigned them human names and ages.

According to the president, these samples were then submitted to a Tanzanian laboratory to test for the coronavirus. Laboratory technicians were not told that these were not human samples.

Samples from the papaya and the goat tested positive for coronavirus, Magufuli said.

He added that this meant it was likely that some people in Tanzania were falsely testing positive for coronavirus.

“There is something happening. I said before we should not accept that every aid is meant to be good for this nation,” the president said. According to the report, Magufuli said he wants the imported testing kits investigated.

In recent weeks, several countries around the world including the United States, Australia, Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands have rejected coronavirus medical equipment imported from China as defective.

On April 21, Indian health authorities told states to stop using coronavirus testing kits imported from China after a scientific investigation concluded they were wildly inaccurate. This rejection of Chinese-made goods by India was a demonstration of “prejudice” according to the Chinese embassy in New Delhi last week.

“It is unfair and irresponsible for certain individuals to label Chinese products as ‘faulty’ and look at issues with pre-emptive prejudice,” Chinese embassy spokeswoman Ji Rong said in a statement.

Last month, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) called on the world to “stop smearing Chinese [coronavirus] assistance” in an article published in the state-run newspaper Global Times.

“I think the quality issue reported by some media has been politicized. They can’t prove the reported testing kits have quality issues, because the use and transport [of the kits] may influence their stability and sensitivity,” an employee at Beijing Beier Bioengineering, a test kit provider, told the newspaper.

In Tanzania, Magufuli’s government has drawn criticism in recent weeks for failing to take the coronavirus pandemic seriously. In March, he said Tanzanians need prayer, not medical masks, to protect themselves from the coronavirus.

Tanzania has not taken extensive measures against the coronavirus pandemic yet, unlike most other African nations. Markets, public transportation, and shops remain open in the country, although schools and universities have been closed.

On April 29, a prominent Tanzanian lawyer was arrested for saying the coronavirus was “serious” and “a real threat” to the nation. News of the arrest came amid accusations from a Tanzanian opposition leader that Magufuli’s government was hiding the true number of coronavirus cases and deaths, both believed to be much higher than reported.

At press time on Monday, Tanzania had officially reported 480 infections and 16 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/tanzania-president-says-faulty-imported-test-kit-claimed-goat-coronavirus/

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-05-03,"Islamists Massacre 12 Christians, Kidnap Bride and Groom from Wedding","Muslim Fulani raiders in north-west Nigeria slaughtered 12 Christians and kidnapped a couple from their church wedding ceremony in recent days, Christian Today reports.

In late April, Fulani militants killed seven Christians in three separate attacks over five days in Rafi County, including the execution of two Christians in Gidigori village on April 20th.

A group of Islamists also stormed a church in Shiroro County where a wedding was taking place on April 12th, kidnapping the bride and groom along with some other church members.

“As the pastor was officiating during the wedding solemnization, the herdsmen stormed the church and took away everyone who was unable to escape from the church building, including the bride and groom,” said area resident Danjuma Iliya.

“In that village, five Christians were killed in the series of attacks carried out by the herdsmen.”

Armed Fulani herdsmen also abducted Emmanuel Iliya Agiya, elder and treasurer of the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) in Jema’a County on April 22nd.

The raiders reportedly fired shots into the air to scare local villagers before breaking into Iliya’s house and leading him away at gunpoint.

“The armed herdsmen first tried to forcefully gain entry into the house of the brother of the victim but were unsuccessful,” said Aku Joshua Shai, an eyewitness to the attack. “They then proceeded to the next house, the victim’s house, dragged him out, and then took him away at gunpoint.”

Shai added that in the same county, armed Fulani militants attacked Zakkan village on April 14, killing one Christian, 40-year-old Abel Danjuma, and wounding two others.

“The three victims are members of the Catholic Church at Zakkan village,” Shai said. “The herdsmen, too, blocked the Abuja-Jos route at Zakkan village and kidnapped two young girls who were travelling from Abuja to Taraba state. The girls were later rescued and set free by Christians from Zakkan village who went in pursuit of the herdsmen and rescued the girls.”

The U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom included Nigeria in its shortlist of “Countries of Particular Concern” (CPC) in its 2020 report released last week, asserting that the nation is guilty of engaging in or tolerating “particularly severe” violations of religious freedom.

Likewise, in December 2019, the State Department named Nigeria to its Special Watch List (SWL) for severe violations of religious liberty.

['Dr. Susan Berry'],2020-05-05,Report: Connecticut Nursing Homes Hardest Hit by Coronavirus Had Prior Serious Infection Violations,"A Connecticut media outlet’s investigation of inspection reports for nursing homes hit by large numbers of coronavirus cases reveals the facilities were likely to have prior federal infection control violations and other serious problems months before COVID-19 hit the state.

CT Mirror reported Monday results of its analysis of inspection reports and evaluations for nursing homes with a significant number of residents infected with COVID-19 showed the facilities were more likely to have had prior serious infection control violations, staffing level problems, and poor inspection grades than those with no cases of coronavirus.

According to the report:

Among the facilities where at least 10% of the residents have COVID-19, just over half recorded “below or much below average” ratings compared to one-third of the homes without the virus. And while it is not universally true, the homes fined or cited for violations are the ones now most likely to be hardest hit by COVID-19.

Currently, 58 percent of all coronavirus-related deaths in Connecticut have occurred in nursing homes. About 1,250 nursing home residents are believed to have already died in the state due to the COVID-19 infection.

CT Mirror’s data reflected overall ratings from federal inspections of nursing homes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

The analysis showed 34 percent of all Connecticut nursing homes had below average inspection ratings, compared to 40 percent of facilities in which 10 percent of residents have been infected with COVID-19. In nursing homes in which none of the residents have the infection, 26 percent scored below average prior to the pandemic.

In Waterbury, for example, 33 elderly or disabled at Abbott Terrace Health Center became ill with a “respiratory outbreak” last summer – months before a pandemic was declared.

“Within two weeks, one out of every six residents had contracted the illness,” CT Mirror reported.

In July, federal inspectors found serious violations at Abbott Terrace, including failure by staff to wash hands or switch gloves between work with residents or after changing soiled bedding.

Even after the last inspection, staff at the facility were never trained in how to control the spread of infection, said the report.

Currently, Abbott Terrace has one of the highest rates of COVID-19 infection in the state, with the number of residents with the infection having spiked from 69 to 120 in just two weeks.

CT Mirror reported in April nursing home workers and their union leaders said the state has not provided them with sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) or adequate funding.

The report noted that unannounced inspection visits by the state Department of Public Health, the Connecticut National Guard, and CDC officials are occurring.

Gov. Ned Lamont (D) has reportedly said the staffing problems at the facilities are isolated and most of them now have sufficient PPE.

However, the report noted spokespersons for Lamont and the state’s public health department did not appear to know the status of the inspection reports or their conclusions.

“The governor makes orders all the time,” the governor’s spokesman, Max Reiss, reportedly responded. “Is he supposed to sit behind his desk and go through 50 reports? No. There’s no governor doing that.”

Nursing homes and the policies governing them are coming under more pronounced scrutiny as the elderly are more vulnerable to becoming infected with the COVID-19 respiratory illness.

In New York last week, the New York Post reported state officials allowed nursing home staff known to be infected with the coronavirus to remain at work with residents in a facility in rural Steuben County.

On March 25, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) issued a directive ordering nursing homes to accept coronavirus patients.

“ No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19,” the directive stated . “NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.”

While Cuomo has since said nursing homes may tell state Department of Public Health officials they cannot accept COVID-19 patients or transfer them to other facilities, some reported the state did not respond to their concerns.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/report-connecticut-nursing-homes-hardest-hit-by-coronavirus-had-prior-serious-infection-violations/

['Robert Kraychik'],2020-05-04,Rep. Mike Johnson: Relax State Licensing Requirements to Help Economic Recovery,"Relaxing state-issued occupational licensing regulations should be included in the economic recovery policy linked to the coronavirus outbreak, said Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA), offering his remarks on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Sunday with host Joel Pollak.

Johnson highlighted state-issued occupational licensing for hairstylists and florists as examples of “ridiculous” economic restrictions.

“Look at my home state of Louisiana,” Johnson said. “We’re one of the worst. You have to get a license to braid hair in Louisiana. You have to get a license to arrange flowers in a vase to be a florist. It’s ridiculous.”

“Onerous” government regulations obstruct economic mobility, noted Johnson. He said, “So many states have [governments that are] so onerous. The burdens are so great [that] the people don’t have any mobility. The whole goal of our tax policy and economic policy should be more economic mobility for more people because that’s how you climb up to the next rung on the proverbial ladder, and that’s how you achieve the American Dream.”

Johnson continued, “But increasingly, over the decades, the American Dream has been pulled further beyond the grasp of more people. Our goal — what we should be doing right now in earnest — is bringing that back within everyone’s grasp, and something as simple as these occupational licensing [regulations], it sounds like a minor point, but it’s a big deal.”

Johnson went on, “Some of these occupational licensing [regulations prevent] healthcare workers, for example, [from working] across state lines. We ought to eliminate some of that, particularly in the time of a pandemic when everything’s brought into focus. If some of these very qualified persons who are licensed in one state were allowed to operate in a neighboring state — at least at certain times and under certain conditions — we would be a lot better suited to address all these problems were facing.”

Americans would broadly support the elimination of occupational licensing regulations of the aforementioned variety. “There are a lot of ideas like that, that if you presented it to the average American, they would nod their heads in agreement and say, ‘Of course, we should do that. Why don’t we well?’

Relaxing occupational licensing mandates are a part of the Republican Study Committee’s — a caucus of congressional conservatives — 37-point economic recovery proposal, noted Johnson.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2020/05/04/rep-mike-johnson-relax-state-licensing-requirements-to-help-economic-recovery/

['Pam Key'],2020-05-05,CNN’s Bash: Trump Claim Dems Want Death ‘Absolutely Ridiculous and Reprehensible’,"Tuesday on CNN, political correspondent Dana Bash said President Donald Trump accusing the Democrats of wanting him to be unsuccessful in his coronavirus pandemic response, which would mean more death was “absolutely ridiculous and reprehensible.”

When asked by reporters about not allowing Dr. Fauci to testify before the House, Trump said, “Because the House is a setup. The House is a bunch of Trump haters. They put every Trump hater on the committee. The same old stuff. They, frankly, want our situation to be unsuccessful, which means death, which means death.”

Bash said, “One thing I really want to touch on that the president mentioned at the beginning, which may seem like Washington stuff, but it is so important. It helps to answer that very question you just asked me, which is congressional oversight. The fact that the president is so flagrant and open in the notion that he’s not allowing anybody from the administration to testify before the House because the House is run by Democrats is ridiculous. And it flies in the face of the Constitution, what is required of Congress. Yes, Fauci is going to go before the Republican-controlled Senate next week. And that committee is run by a very fair-minded Republican, Lamar Alexander, but the idea that even now the president just doesn’t care about basic checks and balances in the Constitution is remarkable. Elections have consequences — Democrats took control of the House, period.”

Anchor Jim Sciutto said, “He’s choosing his oversight. He’s saying I’ll allow the oversight from the Republican-controlled Senate but not the Democratic-controlled House. He said House Democrats, specifically, I believe, want the U.S. response to the coronavirus to be unsuccessful, which he said means death. That’s quite a charge, is it not, to level at House Democrats?”

Bash responded, “Of course it is, and it’s ridiculous. It’s absolutely ridiculous and reprehensible that he’s doing that. And he’s doing it as he is, we should note, getting on his helicopter and his plane and going to Arizona, a very important battleground state for his reelection. The first time he’s doing this in a very long time and taking a risk in doing so. He’s very clear he’s done with staying at the White House. We’ll see if this is just the beginning of other changes and if the rallies in some way, shape or form that he loves will start again.”

It helps to answer that very question you just asked me, which is congressional oversight. The fact that the president is so flagrant and open in the notion that he’s not allowing anybody from the administration to testify before the House because the House is run by Democrats is ridiculous. And it flies in the face of the Constitution, what is required of Congress. Yes, Fauci is going to go before the Republican-controlled Senate next week. And that committee is run by a very fair-minded Republican, Lamar Alexander, but the idea that even now the president just doesn’t care about basic checks and balances in the Constitution is remarkable. Elections have consequences — Democrats took control of the House, period.”

Anchor Jim Sciutto said, “He’s choosing his oversight. He’s saying I’ll allow the oversight from the Republican-controlled Senate but not the Democratic-controlled House. He said House Democrats, specifically, I believe, want the U.S. response to the coronavirus to be unsuccessful, which he said means death. That’s quite a charge, is it not, to level at House Democrats?”

Bash responded, “Of course it is, and it’s ridiculous. It’s absolutely ridiculous and reprehensible that he’s doing that. And he’s doing it as he is, we should note, getting on his helicopter and his plane and going to Arizona, a very important battleground state for his reelection. The first time he’s doing this in a very long time and taking a risk in doing so. He’s very clear he’s done with staying at the White House. We’ll see if this is just the beginning of other changes and if the rallies in some way, shape or form that he loves will start again.”

['Trent Baker'],2020-05-05,Azar: Trump’s Reopening Recommendations ‘Based on the Soundest Scientific Evidence and Modeling’,"Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar weighed in on the report of a draft report from FEMA and the CDC predicting up to 200,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by June 1.

With many questioning President Donald Trump’s push to reopen the country, Azar told Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom” he has not seen the report and it has not been reviewed by the White House, adding the president’s recommendations on reopening the U.S. economy are “based on the soundest scientific evidence and modeling” rather than draft projections.

“So, I’ve not seen that report,” Azar advised. “I’ve heard about it, obviously. There are hundreds of models that are drafted up to look at various contingencies out in the private-public health world, as well as within our agencies. This apparently is a draft modeling a report of various contingencies prepared by Johns Hopkins. This was not reviewed by the White House or senior leadership or the task force. The president’s recommendations on reopening the American economy are based on the soundest scientific evidence and modeling and forecasting, not draft initial projections that just are floating out there.”

He added, “We actually rely on especially the University of Washington’s model has been quite influential, as well as other work that Dr. Deborah Birx leads, to make sure we’re relying on the soundest, validated, scientific, epidemiological information.”

['Hannah Bleau'],2020-05-05,"Democrat PAC Sues Florida Officials, Calls for Eased Restrictions on Mail-in Voting","The Democrat PAC Priorities USA filed a lawsuit against Florida officials — including Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Attorney General Ashley Moody (R), and Secretary of State Laurel Lee (R) — over the state’s voting laws, contending that certain changes need to be made to make mail-in voting easier for the upcoming November election.

The PAC joined others, including the Florida Alliance for Retired Americans and Alianza for Progress, in challenging certain provisions they believe makes it more difficult for voters to mail in a ballot. They argue that November’s election will bring what Politico described as an “unprecedented spike in demand for mail-in ballots and a reduction of poll workers and elections staff,” citing coronavirus-related concerns.

The groups specifically take aim at the deadline for mail-in ballots, contending that officials should count ballots postmarked by Election Day. They also view the basic requirement for postage as too burdensome. That, in itself, “amounts to a poll tax,” and the “voter assistance ban imposes unreasonable restrictions on speech and the right of association,” Politico explained.

“No Floridian should ever be forced to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote,” Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil said in a statement, attributing his call for these changes to the coronavirus.

“Our country faces a once in a lifetime health crisis, local and state leaders need to make sure that every Florida voter has full, equal, and safe access to the ballot box in November,” he added.

The lawsuit coincides with a similar legal challenge lodged by the Dream Defenders and New Florida Majority, which filed a lawsuit in March, demanding officials to extend the vote-by-mail deadline for the primary. With the primary behind Florida voters, the groups have now modified their complaint:

The activists amended their complaint this month to focus on changing protocols for the upcoming elections and to add a group of new plaintiffs, including the LGBTQ+ youth advocacy group Zebra Coalition and Young, who is president of the Florida Council of the Blind. The new complaint expands the scope of the lawsuit to demand that the state provide more options for people with disabilities and language barriers, expand early voting locations and dates, provide a better online voter registration system, and improve the vote-by-mail process so that it doesn’t disenfranchise groups who have historically had their mailed ballots rejected.

The lawsuits come as progressive dark money groups increase their shadowy efforts to politicize the coronavirus and, specifically, use the fear surrounding the crisis to gain ground on the liberal universal vote-by-mail agenda.

Priorities USA has, in many ways, taken the lead on the vote-by-mail effort, teaming up with the anti-Trump group Organizing Together in airing ads touting their agenda.

As Breitbart News reported:

Trump’s reelection campaign this month slammed an attack ad by the Soros-backed Priorities USA Super PAC, which criticized Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic “by using deceptively edited quotes from briefings and the news media,” as Breitbart News detailed. That effort — the focused criticism of the president — has now been coupled with what has, until now, remained the left’s dormant scheme to push universal vote-by-mail, which Republicans warn drastically increases the chances of voter fraud and compromises the integrity of elections.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), along with a host of her progressive counterparts, is calling for the next stage of coronavirus relief to include provisions for universal vote-by-mail.

“This is the lifeblood of our democracy, the vote. So here we are trying to protect the lives of American people, the livelihoods of the American people, and also the life of our democracy,” Pelosi said last month.

“That is what we are going to do in the next bill as well,” she vowed.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/05/democrat-pac-sues-florida-officials-calls-for-eased-restrictions-on-mail-in-voting/

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-04,Michelle Obama: Black Americans Not Voting in 2016 was a ‘Slap in the Face’,"Former first lady Michelle Obama says in her upcoming Netflix documentary Becoming that it was a “slap in the face’’ that black Americans failed to show up to vote in the 2016 presidential election, according to the New York Post.

“It takes some energy to go high, and we were exhausted from it … when you’re the first black anything,’’ Obama said, referring to her and her husband, former President Barack Obama, of their failed efforts to help election then-Democrat White House nominee Hillary Clinton.

“You know, the day I left the White House, it was painful to sit on that stage, and then a lot of our folks didn’t vote — it was almost a slap in the face,” the former first lady added.

“It wasn’t just in this election, but every midterm, every time Barack didn’t get the Congress he needed, that was because our folks didn’t show up,” she said during another point in the film. “After all that work, they just couldn’t be bothered to vote at all. That’s my trauma.”

During the highly-anticipated documentary, Obama also shoots down the prospect of returning to politics — even as calls grow for former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, to select the former first lady as his running mate.

“Now we’re out of the White House, not to be viewed, judged and parceled by every other person on the planet — yeah, it’s better, it’s absolutely freeing,’’ said Obama. “Being the first lady has been the greatest honor of my life. But how many people are in that position where the entire attention of everything is you, every gesture you make, every blink of an eye is being analyzed?

“Barack and I are not interested in being at the forefront forever — not even for that much longer,’’ she added

The film, described as “an intimate look into the life of former first lady Michelle Obama” chronicles her 34-city book tour in 2018-2019 for her best-selling memoir “Becoming.” Obama’s promotional tour, managed by the concert promoter Live Nation, had the scale of a rock tour, with a string of dates at sold-out arenas.

The film will debut May 6 on Netflix. In a statement, Obama said the experience of the tour “drove home the idea that what we share in common is deep and real and can’t be messed with.”

“We processed the past and imagined a better future. In talking about the idea of ‘becoming,’ many of us dared to say our hopes out loud,” said Obama. “I treasure the memories and that sense of connection now more than ever, as we struggle together to weather this pandemic, as we care for our loved ones, tend to our communities, and try to keep up with work and school while coping with huge amounts of loss, confusion, and uncertainty.”

['Edwin Mora'],2020-05-05,First Week of Ramadan Deadlier than 2019,"Islamic terrorists, mainly the Taliban, were responsible for 185 fatalities and 188 injuries during the first week of Ramadan, a time when extremists believe martyrdom and jihad are exceptionally rewarded in paradise, a Breitbart News tally revealed.

That means, on average, terrorists killed about 26 people each day during the first full seven days of the holiest week for Muslims — April 24 to 30. During that same period, there were 60 terrorist attacks that took place in 13 countries, resulting in a total of 373 casualties, including fatalities and injuries.

That translates to over 50 casualties each day during the holiest month for Islam adherents.

As it has done in the last three years, Breitbart News will provide regular updates on the carnage during Ramadan, which began at sunset on April 23 in most countries and will last through sundown on May 23.

The first full day of fasting fell on April 24, the first day Breitbart News began its count.

While several countries and regions have put their citizens on some form of lockdown, including Kabul, the coronavirus pandemic plaguing the globe has not slowed the war in Afghanistan.

So far, the deadliest group during the ongoing month of Ramadan is the Afghan Taliban, responsible for 130 deaths, or nearly 70 percent of all fatalities during the first week. Afghan Taliban jihadis are also behind over 75 percent (144) of all injuries.

As a result of the Taliban’s relentless attacks, Afghanistan is so far the deadliest country of the holy month, home to 40, or about two-thirds, of all 60 documented assaults during the first week of Ramadan.

The Taliban rejected a U.S.-backed Ramadan truce offered by Afghanistan, reportedly saying a ceasefire is “not rational” as they ramp up attacks on the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) and civilians.

At the end of February, the United States and the Taliban narco-jihadis signed an agreement calling for the conditions-based withdrawal of American and foreign military forces.

Even as the Taliban ramps up attacks, the first phase of the withdrawal of foreign forces is already underway, a U.S. reconstruction watchdog noted last week. America is reportedly working on bringing the number of American troops in the war and pandemic-ravaged country to well below 10,000. American troops invaded Afghanistan in October 2001.

Despite the demise of its so-called caliphate in March 2019, the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates continue to wreak havoc, responsible for 36 deaths and five injuries during the first days of Ramadan, primarily in Iraq.

“The terrorist activities of Daesh [Islamic State] have increased during Ramadan [Muslims’ holy month],” Nihad Mohammed, a spokesperson for the police in Iraq’s Diyala province, declared.

The jihadi group continues to operate outside the Middle East. On April 27, an ISIS-linked man in France rammed his car into two police motorcyclists, seriously injuring them.

There was also one ISIS-linked attack each in Egypt, the Philippines, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Although to a much lesser extent, other jihadi groups have also been carrying out attacks during Ramadan, including Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis in Yemen, and the al-Qaeda-linked Hayyat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS).

Even with the fall of the ISIS caliphate in 2019, the first week of Ramadan this year is deadlier than in 2019. Jihadists killed at least 165 people and injured another 145 in the first week of that year.

Jihadist groups and other Islamists are known to urge their members and supporters to engage in jihad on Ramadan, believing that martyrs will get extra rewards in paradise. Despite these attempts, the vast majority of Muslims solely abide by Ramadan’s fasting tradition: abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset.

Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website in coordination with news and government reports.

Given that news outlets and governments fail to report many of the terrorist attacks in real-time, the casualty total for the first week is subject to change.

Government officials may also update some of the casualty totals as some of the injured victims succumb to their injuries.

All the terrorist attacks so far during Ramadan 2020, as documented by Breitbart News, include:

At the end of February, the United States and the Taliban narco-jihadis signed an agreement calling for the conditions-based withdrawal of American and foreign military forces.

Even as the Taliban ramps up attacks, the first phase of the withdrawal of foreign forces is already underway, a U.S. reconstruction watchdog noted last week. America is reportedly working on bringing the number of American troops in the war and pandemic-ravaged country to well below 10,000. American troops invaded Afghanistan in October 2001.

Despite the demise of its so-called caliphate in March 2019, the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its affiliates continue to wreak havoc, responsible for 36 deaths and five injuries during the first days of Ramadan, primarily in Iraq.

“The terrorist activities of Daesh [Islamic State] have increased during Ramadan [Muslims’ holy month],” Nihad Mohammed, a spokesperson for the police in Iraq’s Diyala province, declared.

The jihadi group continues to operate outside the Middle East. On April 27, an ISIS-linked man in France rammed his car into two police motorcyclists, seriously injuring them.

There was also one ISIS-linked attack each in Egypt, the Philippines, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Although to a much lesser extent, other jihadi groups have also been carrying out attacks during Ramadan, including Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Iran-allied Shiite Houthis in Yemen, and the al-Qaeda-linked Hayyat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS).

Even with the fall of the ISIS caliphate in 2019, the first week of Ramadan this year is deadlier than in 2019. Jihadists killed at least 165 people and injured another 145 in the first week of that year.

Jihadist groups and other Islamists are known to urge their members and supporters to engage in jihad on Ramadan, believing that martyrs will get extra rewards in paradise. Despite these attempts, the vast majority of Muslims solely abide by Ramadan’s fasting tradition: abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset.

Breitbart News primarily gleans its tally from the Religion of Peace website in coordination with news and government reports.

Given that news outlets and governments fail to report many of the terrorist attacks in real-time, the casualty total for the first week is subject to change.

Government officials may also update some of the casualty totals as some of the injured victims succumb to their injuries.

['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-05-05,Coronavirus Returns Long-Banned Drive-in Movie Shows to Iran,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — The new coronavirus pandemic has brought back something unseen in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution: a drive-in movie theater.

Once decried by revolutionaries for allowing too much privacy for unmarried young couples, a drive-in theater now operates from a parking lot right under Tehran’s iconic Milad tower, showing a film in line with the views of hard-liners.

Workers spray disinfectants on cars that line up each night here after buying tickets online for what is called the “Cinema Machine” in Farsi. They tune into the film’s audio via an FM station on their car radios.

With stadiums shut and movie theaters closed, this parking-lot screening is the only film being shown in a communal setting amid the virus outbreak in Iran, one of the world’s worst. Iran has reported more than 98,600 cases with over 6,200 deaths, though international and local experts acknowledge Iran’s toll is likely far higher.

“It was very fascinating, this is the first time this is happening, at least for people my age,” said Behrouz Pournezam, 36, who watched the film along with his wife. “We are here mostly for the excitement to be honest, the movie itself didn’t matter that much. I didn’t care what movie it is or by whom or which genre.”

The film being shown, however, is “Exodus,” produced by a firm affiliated with Iran’s hard-line Revolutionary Guard. The film by director Ebrahim Hatamikia focuses on cotton farmers whose fields die from salt water brought by local dams. The farmers, led by an actor who appears to be the Islamic Republic’s answer to American cowboy stand-in Sam Elliott, drive their tractors to Tehran to protest the government.

There is precedent for this anger. Iran had built dams across the country since the revolution — especially under hard-line former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad — that environmentalists blame for damaging waterways and farmland. But this film instead involves “a peasant protest against the local authority that symbolically resembles President Hassan Rouhani’s government,” the state-owned Tehran Times said.

Rouhani, a relative moderate in Iran’s Shiite theocracy, has increasingly faced hard-line criticism amid the collapse of his nuclear deal with world powers. Those allied with his administration have criticized the film.

Moviegoer Atefeh Soheili, however, was glad just to enjoy entertainment outside of her home.

“Now I’m sitting here with clean hands and if I want to eat something or relax I don’t need to worry about distancing from other people,” she said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/05/coronavirus-returns-long-banned-drive-in-movie-shows-to-iran/

Kurtz met with several world leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and all agreed to take preventative measures against the spread of the coronavirus, including wearing masks and undergoing tests.

On Monday, Netanyahu announced the easing of lockdown restrictions.

['Frances Martel'],2020-05-04,Health Minister: Iran 'Outperformed' World Powers on Coronavirus,"Iranian Health Minister Saeed Namaki applauded his country in a post Monday on Twitter, claiming that Iran – among the countries with the highest coronavirus infection and death rates in the world – “outperformed the most powerful countries” in the world, presumably among them the United States and China.

The Iranian government claims that, at press time, it had documented 98,647 cases of Chinese coronavirus cases in the country. Among those, Tehran claims 6,277 people have died. These numbers have been the source of much controversy, however, as local officials have repeatedly questioned Tehran’s numbers and journalists have noted that the sum of regional coronavirus case numbers is much higher than the national number. The dissident National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), which has kept its own tally of coronavirus figures based on intelligence from within the country, claims nearly 40,000 people have died since the outbreak began in the holy city of Qom.

Iranian officials tasked the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, with national coronavirus response. The IRGC claimed to be working on a vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus in March, despite being an armed criminal gang with no known history of pharmaceutical development.

“By God’s grace and with the sacrifices made by my colleagues, we have outperformed the most powerful countries in the fight against coronavirus,” Namaki posted on Twitter, according to Iran’s Tasnim News Agency. Namaki noted that Iran had to contend with a “financial crunch” – an attack on the U.S. sanctions placed on the country in response to its repeated violations of international law and, specifically, the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal – and has fought the virus with a much smaller budget than those “who have spent billions of dollars.”

Elsewhere this weekend, Namaki asserted that Iran had successfully controlled the outbreak.

He did not identify any country by name, leaving open-ended if his critique of other countries was meant merely for overt enemies like the United States, or also for nominal allies like China. While the Iranian government applauded China for its handling of the crisis and claimed to receive humanitarian aid for some time, Health Ministry officials appeared to turn on the Communist Party in April.

“It seems statistics from China was a bitter joke because many in the world thought this is just like influenza, with fewer deaths,” Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said last month. “This [impression] were based on reports from China and now it seems China made a bitter joke with the rest of the world … If in China they say an epidemic was controlled in two months, one should really think about it.”

Iranian Center for HIV/AIDS head Minoo Mohraz also accused China that month of “slacking” on providing data regarding the number of people affected by its epidemic.

“Wrong data leads to wrong results and incorrect policies which in turn lead to in an increase in the number of victims,” yet another health official in Iran, coronavirus task force member Hamid Souri, said at the time, referring specifically to China’s “wrong data.”

Chinese statistics on the outbreak in the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, were used to form the academic models that governments throughout the world heeded in making policy to save lives. Ample evidence has surfaced that China has falsely deflated the number of cases in the country. One study suggested that the real number of people infected in China is as much as 100 times larger than the one the Communist Party reported.

Despite having already admitted to using faulty Chinese numbers to orchestrate its response, the government of Iran announced on Monday that it was planning to share its alleged expertise to help other countries end their regional outbreaks. Aqa Mohammadi, a member of Iran’s Expediency Council, which advises Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, claimed that “several countries have asked for Iran’s successful experiences in battling coronavirus as well as effective use of public capacities in this field” and that they would soon receive an organized response. Health Ministry officials, state media claimed, had announced plans to export coronavirus testing kits around the world.

Mohammadi also claimed that Iran’s response to the pandemic had occurred in the “best form possible.”

Jahanpour – who has previously criticized the Iranian regime for, among other things, holding mass public funerals creating the sort of crowds that governments around the world have been trying to prevent from gathering – announced a rise of over one thousand newly identified cases in the 24 hours between Sunday and Monday. Health Minister Namaki has claimed the outbreak would be controlled by late May at the latest in Iran.

President Hassan Rouhani announced the reopening of most mosques in what Iran is calling “white” areas – those with low density of coronavirus cases – on Monday. Among the bigger challenges Iran has faced in controlling the outbreak is the fact that Islamic clerics have openly defied social distancing measures, urging mobs to unite against the government and demand religious sites remain open. It is currently Ramadan, the holiest month of Islam and one that requires greater participation in mosque activities. The mosques are expected to attract large crowds on Friday, the traditional day of mosque prayers.

And so, they’ve chosen to go after China. Look, there’s a lot to criticize China about. I don’t want to make any mistakes about that. They should have been far more transparent about the human-to-human transmission, and they did conceal things, but whether they can get the intelligence agencies to somehow search for the conclusion they want to reach, that’s not how the agencies are supposed to work, and there’s a danger in the administration either putting out theories that cannot be substantiated or deliberately provoking a fight during the middle of a pandemic.”

['Neil Munro'],2020-05-04,Report: Labor Department Cheats American Graduates,"President Donald Trump’s Department of Labor cheats many millions of American graduates by allowing employers to import foreign contract workers at below-market wages, says a May 4 report by the Economic Policy Institute.

“DOL lets H-1B employers undercut local wages,” said the report, titled “H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels.” The report continues:

Sixty percent of H-1B positions certified by the U.S. Department of Labor are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation. While H-1B program rules allow this, DOL has the authority to change it—but hasn’t.

The H-1B program allows employers to import roughly 100,000 foreign graduates each year, just as 800,000 young Americans graduate from colleges with skilled degrees in business, health care, design, software, and science.

The labor department allows companies to import their foreign workers — mostly from poor India — under cheap, no-benefits contracts. This policy undercuts U.S. graduates who must earn higher salaries to pay off debts to expensive U.S. colleges, pay U.S.-level health insurance, and buy houses in U.S. districts made expensive by the annual inflow of immigrants.

The report says:

In fiscal 2019, a total of 60% of H-1B positions certified by DOL had been assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation: 14% were at H-1B Level 1 (the 17th percentile) and 46% were at H-1B Level 2 (34th percentile).

The report urges the labor department to protect Americans by raising the minimum wages that must be paid to the visa workers:

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has broad discretion to set H-1B wage levels, that is, the minimum wage employers must pay their H-1B workers, which corresponds to the H-1B workers’ occupation and the region where they will be employed. By law, DOL must set four H-1B wage levels—which it does according to wage survey data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Employment Statistics survey. DOL has set the two lowest levels (of the four) well below the local median wage. … Changing program rules to require and enforce above-median wages for H-1B workers would disincentivize the hiring of H-1B workers as a money-saving exercise, ensuring that companies will use the program as intended—to bring in workers who have special skills—instead of using the H-1B as a way to fill entry-level positions at a discount. … We recommend that DOL use its existing authority to set the lowest (Level 1) wage to the 75th percentile for the occupation and local area and also require that wage offers to H-1B workers never be lower than the national median wage for the occupation.

Eugene Scalia heads the department of labor. The visa programs are overseen by the department’s Wage and Hour Division, which is now run by a former counsel for President Geoge W. Bush.

The visa programs have helped to suppress salaries for college graduates for at least 20 years. Since 2000, wages for the top ten percent of U.S. college graduates have only grown 15 percent, while wages for average graduates have grown just 8.8 percent, according to a February report by the EPI.

On April 22, Trump directed his deputies to recommend changes to the visa workes programs so that Americans can regain jobs as the economy recovers. Unsurprisingly, business groups oppose any curbs on the visa worker programs.

George W. Bush is backing estb.'s soft-focus PR #AllofUS campaign for unity, b/ his economic director spilled the beans:

""We don’t want [Trump’s] temporary [immigration] policy to become permanent.""

Investors & progressives unite for extra migrants. #H1Bhttps://t.co/SaNsCK9x8V — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) May 4, 2020

The overall population of H-1B contract workers is roughly 900,000. They are imported alongside a wide variety of other contract workers, including OPTs, CPTs, L-1s, J-1s, TNs, E-3s, and B-1s. The resident population of white-collar visa workers is roughly 1.5 million.

Roughly 53,000 employers use the H-1B outsourcing program, but most of the foreign workers are imported by a few Fortune 500 companies, according to the report.

While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B program in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019. … Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa. … … Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major U.S. firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple, and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill.

The elite employers use the program to undercut salaries for American graduates by using foreign contract workers at the lowest of the four levels. The report says:

Amazon and Microsoft each had three-fourths or more of their H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2.

Walmart and Uber had roughly half of their H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2.

IBM had three-fifths of its H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2.

Qualcomm and Salesforce had two-fifths of their H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2.

Google had over one-half assigned as Level 2.

Apple had one-third of its H-1B positions assigned as Level 2

The report spotlights the potential for companies to spike their stock market value by slashing their payroll costs with an imported workforce.

But the EPI report ignores many hidden costs of the H-1B program that are also ignored by business groups.

For example, numerous Americans say the existence of this vast foreign worker population blocks many young Americans from getting starter jobs at Fortune 500 companies, reduces salaries for millions of U.S. graduates, and degrades Americans’ professional careers into a series of unstable monthly “gig” contracts.

The supply of subsidized foreign white-collar labor also allows business school executives to degrade the workplace authority and free speech of innovative American professionals, to subordinate the development and reliability of technology to the priorities of foreign workers and also to subordinate technological quality to the demands for quarterly profits by U.S. and Indian CEOs and investors.

These hidden costs are ignored by the Silicon Valley companies, whose many visa workers at helping them the competition against Chinese companies. For example, Eric Schmidt, one of the former H-1B advocates at Google, is calling for a Valley bailout that would provide yet more H-1B visa workers:

Trump’s directions to his agency leaders to reconsider the visa programs will start a fight within the White House as reforms try to get Americans into the Fortune 500 jobs and investors’ lobbyists try to protect their supply of cheap labor.

['Neil Munro'],2020-05-04,Bloomberg News: Import More Migrants Because Americans Can’t Get It Done,"The United States will need even more immigrants once the economy has recovered from the coronavirus crash, according to the editorial board of Mike Bloomberg’s news site.

“The U.S. will need to bring in more foreign talent, not less, to fill labor shortages in critical fields, notably health care, and to promote innovation,” the editorial board of Bloomberg.com claimed.

“The [post-crash] goals should be to increase immigrant admissions overall, while prioritizing skills over family ties, strengthening border security, and providing a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country,” said the board.

The board strongly supports the federal policy of subsidizing investors and companies with an annual inflow of one million legal immigrant consumers, renters, and workers.

The annual inflow of one million legal immigrants is boosted by the resident army of roughly two million imported contract workers — including H-1B and H-2B workers — plus at least one million temporary workers, plus at least eight million illegal migrants. Every year, this imported population of roughly 45 million people helps investors by cutting wages and raising rents for the four million young Americans who enter the labor force.

Bloomberg’s media company uses the H-1B program to import many immigrant software experts and journalists. This inflow helps Bloomberg to minimize the payroll he offers to American graduates and journalists.

The Bloomberg board also linked their editorial to a pro-migration study by Bloomberg’s advocacy group, dubbed New American Economy.

But political pressure from native-born Americans and from many legal immigrants is pushing President Donald Trump to gradually reduce the inflow of legal immigrants, even after he has successfully blocked large-scale illegal migration from Mexico. On April 22, Trump announced curbs on legal immigration and directed his agency chiefs to draw up plans for cutbacks to the visa worker programs by late May.

Many Fortune 500 companies and many billionaire investors strongly back the federal government’s policy of inflating the labor supply with migrants and visa workers. To block Trump, they have now launched a hard-nosed lobbying campaign and a soft-focus PR campaign in cooperation with various allies, including left-wing groups and former President George W. Bush. The campaign is also supported by Bloomberg and by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

The board’s editorial did make one minor concession to public opinion, saying, “with unemployment soaring, some tailored, temporary restrictions on immigration can be justified.”

In his brief $1 billion campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination, Mike Bloomberg repeatedly insisted that the United States needs to import more immigrants for employers. In January, Breitbart News reported:

“This country needs more immigrants and we should be out looking for immigrants,” Bloomberg told the San Diego Union-Tribune on January 5. “For those who need an oboe player for a symphony, we want the best one. We need a striker for a soccer team, we want to get the best one. We want a farmworker, we want to get the best one. A computer programmer, we want to get the best one. So we should be out looking for more immigrants.” … “If business were able to hire without restrictions from anywhere in the world, pretty much every [American’s] occupation would be foreignized,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. He continued: “Americans would have to accept dramatically lower earnings, whether they object or not. Not just landscapers and tomato pickers, [because] Indians and Chinese by the millions can do nursing and accounting. There would not be any job that would not see its earnings fall to the global average.”

Bloomberg’s board acknowledged that the public opposes their demand for yet more wage-cutting, rent-raising migrants. “Sensible reform this side of November’s election already looked unlikely; the pandemic has made it all but unthinkable,” the board said.

That view is shared by one of Bloomberg’ op-ed columnists, Noah Smith. He wrote April 27, that “We pro-immigration people [have] lost, thanks to external events, the rabid insane commitment of the anti-immigration forces, and the natural ending of the immigration wave.”

In an exclusive interview with Alexander Marlow on SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Daily, Sessions said it is critical that lawmakers defend the interests of unemployed Americans who have been laid off due to forced business closures spurred by the Chinese coronavirus crisis.

LISTEN:

“We have 30 million unemployed … We don’t have jobs in the United States,” Sessions said. “There are no jobs now. We’ll lay off more people this week then we did last week.”

“Why would we bring in foreign workers to take jobs when we don’t have jobs for the American people,” Sessions asked. “What theory is it that they’re operating under when they try to justify such a policy position? It’s certainly not in the interest of the American people. It’s in the interest of their corporate friends and some ideology that they adhere to … so I do think that it’s time for this Congress to deliver on its promises that the president made in the campaign.”

Sessions said more Republican lawmakers must be stepping up to the plate to take on China, holding the communist regime accountable for wrecking the U.S. economy. A select committee in the House and Senate, Sessions said, ought to be formed to determine the truth behind China’s role in spreading the coronavirus to the world.

“Where are the rest of the Republicans? Where are they? I mean this is a big issue,” Sessions said. “This party owes it to the American people to defend our interests — American interests. And I don’t think there’s been near enough action.”

“I would think the first thing we need to do is to rally the people who understand the significance of this and have what I call for, is a select committee to study this pandemic and how it started,” Sessions continued. “We did that after the attack on Pearl Harbor … where House and Senate appoint select members of congress … and the charge is what did China know and what did they do, when did they act on it or not, and did they lie about it? The world needs to know.”

As Breitbart has reported, existing U.S. legal immigration law greatly benefits China. Visa programs such as the EB-5 visa for wealthy foreign investors, the F-1 student visa, and J-1 visas allow about 180,000 Chinese nationals to enter the country every year in addition to the 60,000 to 70,000 Chinese nationals who secure green cards annually.

There are nearly 500,000 Chinese students in the U.S. in any given year — more than any other nation — taking seats in university classrooms and looking to eventually obtain Optional Practical Training (OPT) authorization to take entry-level jobs in white-collar professions.

['John Binder'],2020-05-04,Men Accused of Child Rape Among 830 Inmates Freed in Massachusetts,"Two men accused of raping children are among the nearly 830 Massachusetts inmates that have been freed in the last month over concerns of the Chinese coronavirus crisis spreading in prison facilities.

Convicted child rapist Glenn Christie, 54-years-old, and 29-year-old Matthew Parris, accused of raping two teenage girls this year, have both been released from Massachusetts prisons after the state’s supreme court has ordered the routine release of hundreds of accused and convicted criminals.

As of April 26, Massachusetts officials have released 824 inmates from state prisons since April 3. This means that the state is releasing about 36 inmates every day with no end in sight, all in an effort to empty jails to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

There are about 11o confirmed cases of the coronavirus among inmates in Massachusetts prisons out of more than 310 inmates tested for the virus. A total of 81 correctional officers and 23 other staffers in the state prison system have also tested positive.

Christie is one of the inmates set free thanks to the court order. In 2018, Christie was convicted for repeatedly raping a 12-year-old boy.

Parris, also freed from prison thanks to the court order, was arrested less than two months ago and charged with raping and sexually assaulting two teenage girls.

According to the charges, Parris had been working as a teaching assistant at Southeastern Regional Vocational Technical High School when he contacted a 15-year-old student through Instagram. The two met at a local cemetery, according to police, and Parris allegedly attempted to kiss her and touch her breast. The victim said Parris gave her a bag with a sex toy in it before she fled.

More than a week later, police said Parris threatened and forced the girl to perform oral sex on him in the middle of a school day inside a closet. A second victim told police that Parris had similarly contacted her through Instagram.

When the two met in person, police said Parris forced the girl to perform oral sex on him and threatened the victim’s family. A day later, police said Parris forced the girl to get undressed in his car before driving to a location where he allegedly sexually assaulted her.

Parris had already pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated statutory rape, rape of a child with force, and kidnapping of a child.

['Joshua Caplan'],2020-05-04,NBC News Chairman Andy Lack Stepping Down,"NBC News Chairman Andy Lack will leave his post by the end of the month as part of a corporation-wide shake-up, NBCUniversal’s chief executive announced in a Monday memo to the news organization.

NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell wrote that the company’s news organizations — NBC News, MSNBC and CNBC — will be folded into one group, which will be overseen by NBCUniversal International Group chairman Cesar Conde. Top executives who will now report to Conde include NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, MSNBC chief Phil Griffin, and CNBC chairman Mark Hoffman. Lack planed to depart from NBC News after the 2020 presidential election, according to Deadline.

“Cesar is a well-respected, strategic leader who has succeeded in multiple roles at NBCUniversal since joining the company in 2013,” Shell said in a statement. “Most recently, Cesar has overseen unprecedented growth at Telemundo, which under his leadership has become the number one Spanish-language network, and through its news division has played a critical role in the expansion of news operations, breaking news coverage and trailblazing political reporting. Cesar’s valuable and relevant experience leading broadcast networks and news divisions, combined with his high degree of integrity and proven management skills, make him the right person to lead our news group into the future.”

Lack came under fire following a 2018 New York Times report alleging that NBC News covered up a rape accusation against now-convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein by refusing to greenlight a Ronan Farrow expose. Farrow ultimately took the story to the New Yorker and later won a Pulitzer Prize with The Times for their reporting on Weinstein. “One of the men tasked with reviewing Farrow’s reporting—a key executive under Lack—was himself an accused sexual harasser, multiple sources told The Daily Beast. Under Lack’s tenure, NBCUniversal paid the accuser nearly $1 million for her silence,” the Daily Beast reported at the time. Lack denied the claims, stating Farrow’s reporting wasn’t ready to be published at the time and said he was not involved in any effort to ban the report’s release.

In a separate Daily Beast report, Lack was accused of ignoring several allegations of sexual harassment while he was CEO of the music label Sony BMG.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2020/05/04/nbc-news-chairman-andy-lack-stepping-down/

['Tom Fitton'],2020-05-04,Fitton: Judicial Watch Exposes Deep State Leaks to Washington Post,"Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a distinguished public servant, was briefly national security advisor to President Trump until allegations surfaced in the Washington Post that he had been in communication with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.

Flynn’s lawyers alleged in a November 1, 2019, court filing that James Baker, the Pentagon’s Director of the Office of Net Assessment, “is believed to be the person who illegally leaked” the transcript of Flynn’s December 29, 2016, telephone calls with the ambassador to David Ignatius, a Washington Post reporter.

We went to court to uncover the details, and we now have received 143 pages of records from the Department of Defense that reveal extensive communications between Baker and Ignatius.

The Washington Post published Ignatius’ account of the calls on January 12, 2017, setting in motion a chain of events that led to Flynn’s February 13, 2017, firing as national security advisor, and subsequent prosecution for making false statements to the FBI about the calls.U.S. Attorney John Durham is reportedly investigating the leak of information targeting Flynn.

Citing “the government’s bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement,” Flynn’s attorney, Sidney Powell, moved in January 2020 to withdraw Flynn’s 2017 guilty plea during the Mueller investigation. Flynn claims he felt forced to plead guilty “when his son was threatened with prosecution and he exhausted his financial resources.” Last week, prosecutors provided Flynn’s defense team with documentation of this threat, according to additional papers Flynn’s lawyers filed on April 24, 2020, in support of the motion to withdraw.

We obtained the records in our November 2019 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the DOD failed to respond to a September 2019 request (Judicial Watch v. Department of Defense (No. 1:19-cv-03564)). We were seeking:

All calendar entries of Director James Baker of the Office of Net Assessment.

All records of communications between ONA Director James Baker and reporter David Ignatius.

The communications we requested occurred May 2015 through September 25, 2019.

The records we have received include an exchange on February 16, 2016, with the subject line “Ignatius,” in which Baker tells Pentagon colleague Zachary Mears, then-deputy chief of staff to Obama Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, that he has “a long history with David” and talks with him regularly.

In an email exchange on October 1, 2018, in a discussion about artificial intelligence, Baker tells Ignatius: “David, please, as always, our discussions are completely off the record. If any of my observations strike you as worthy of mixing or folding into your own thinking, that is as usual fine.” Ignatius replies, “Understood. Thanks for talking with me.”

Here are Ignatius and Baker’s email exchanges by year:

In 2015, Ignatius and Baker had a total of seven email conversations to set up meetings or calls, two simply to compliment one another and one exchange where Ignatius invited Baker to speak at the Aspen Strategy Group conference.

In 2016, Ignatius and Baker had a total of 10 email exchanges to set up meetings or calls and two to compliment each other.

In 2017, Ignatius and Baker had a total of 10 email exchanges to set up meetings, one exchange where Ignatius forwarded one of his articles, and one exchange where Ignatius asks Baker for his thoughts on the JCPOA (the Iran nuclear deal), because Baker wasn’t available on the phone.

In 2018, Ignatius and Baker had a total of nine email exchanges to set up meetings, four where Ignatius forwarded articles and one where Ignatius asks Baker for tips on what to say at a quantum computing conference where he was speaking.

These records confirm that Mr. Baker was an anonymous source for Mr. Ignatius. Mr. Baker should be directly questioned about any and all leaks to his friend at the Washington Post.

In a related case, in October 2018 we filed a FOIA lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense seeking information about the September 2016 contract between the DOD and Stefan Halper, the Cambridge University professor identified as a secret FBI informant used by the Obama administration to spy on Trump’s presidential campaign. Halper also reportedly had high-level ties to both U.S. and British intelligence.

Government records show that the DOD’s Office of Net Assessment (ONA) paid Halper a total of $1,058,161 for four contracts that lasted from May 30, 2012, to March 29, 2018. More than $400,000 of the payments came between July 2016 and September 2017, after Halper reportedly offered Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos work and a trip to London to entice him into disclosing information about alleged collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.

Flynn’s attorney told the court that Baker was Halper’s “handler” in the Office of Net Assessment in the Pentagon.

In an interviewwith Lou Dobbs, I discussed the possibility that Judge Emmet Sullivan would look at all of this and throw the Flynn case out or that Attorney General William Barr would cancel the prosecution. “Flynn was ambushed,” I say in the interview. “He is the victim of a coordinated leak campaign.”

I know that President Trump is taking a good hard lookat this. While the FBI is under renewed scrutinyover its disgraceful handling of the Flynn matter, it’s clear we need to look closely at the Defense Department as well.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/04/jfitton-judicial-watch-exposes-deep-state-leaks-to-washington-post/

['Aaron Klein'],2020-05-04,Gov. Ron DeSantis: Media Should Apologize for Causing ‘Frenzy’ Over Beach Reopenings,"Gov. Ron DeSantis suggested members of the national news media should apologize to mayors in Duval County, Florida for hyping criticism of decisions by local jurisdictions to reopen some beaches in mid-April.

The beaches in Duval County were reopened only under social distancing rules.

Seventeen days later, DeSantis presented data that shows Duval County remains among the lowest of the state’s major metropolitan areas when it comes to new Coronavirus cases.

He also showed graphs depicting significant declines in coronavirus hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and the use of ventilators in Duval County.

“I think apologies can be sent to the city of Jacksonville attention Mayor [Lenny] Curry,” said DeSantis, addressing members of the national media. “You may want to CC the mayors of Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach and Atlantic Beach. But I won’t hold my breath on that happening.”

“The facts are that since this has happened hospitalizations, ICU, rate of positivity, [patients on] ventilators — that has all declined. Those people were wrong and the folks in Duval County behaved appropriately,” he added.

DeSantis called on reporters to focus on the “truth” instead of causing a “frenzy” and “allowing things to get carried away.”

Watch his presentation here:

In mid-April, out-of-state media had a spasm because Duval County opened its beaches for recreational use. Now 17 days later, have the fears of this drive-by smear against Floridians been realized?https://t.co/UcXSUk2xcw — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) May 4, 2020

As he was speaking, a screen showed alarmist headlines about the beach reopenings in the New York Times, Washington Post and other newspapers as well as an image from a critical segment on the topic aired on Anderson Cooper’s CNN show.

“#FloridaMorons trends after people flock to reopened Florida beaches,” was the title of a Washington Post piece.

CBS News critically reported that “Mayor Lenny Curry reopened beaches and parks in Jacksonville, Florida on Friday, after Governor Ron DeSantis gave the green light for them to reopen, despite the state hitting a record number of coronavirus cases.”

The New York Times, Washington Post and other media outlets used similar images that show many people walking on a Jacksonville beach. It not clear from the pictures whether those photographed were violating the social distancing rules. The closeup images seem to show people keeping distance but those who can be seen were not wearing masks or other face coverings

“Of course, you look at the photo that is used. It’s like get that lens right in that area so it looks like there are so many people crowded out there,” DeSantis quipped.

Many of the same national media outlets critical of DeSantis and Duval County politicians had nothing to say about the decision by three Democratic governors at around the same time — New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont – to reopen marinas and boatyards also under social distancing rules.

There has also been a lack of criticism about Manhattan’s Central Park being open to the public while visitor centers and playgrounds have been closed until further notice. People magazine recently published photographs showing crowds in Central Park clearly breaking the “six feet apart” guidelines, with many not wearing face masks.

The beach reopenings in northeastern Florida controversially led to Miami Herald metro columnist Fabiola Santiago tweeting that Florida residents packing beaches “should work nicely to thin the ranks” of supporters of President Donald Trump and DeSantis.

Santiago later deleted the offending tweet and issued an apology. Mindy Marques, publisher and executive editor of the Miami Herald, also issued an apology and said the newspaper would “follow up internally.”

Meanwhile, DeSantis presented numbers from Duval County since the beach reopenings showing hospitalizations for coronavirus down 28%, ICU admissions down 50% and ventilator use down 32%, according to data reported to the AHCA Emergency Status System.

The governor showed a graph of case positivity rate that has not seen major spikes and has trended in a promising direction. This while local mainstream media reported in recent days that Duval County remains the lowest among the state’s major metropolitan areas for new positive cases.

The Florida Times-Union paper, for example, reported:

Duval County continues to record positive tests at a rate of 4 percent. That remains the lowest of the state’s largest metropolitan areas: Miami-Dade County has recorded 14 percent positive tests thus far, while Broward and Palm Beach counties both report 10 percent positive and Hillsborough and Orange counties are both at 5 percent.

['Aaron Klein'],2020-05-04,Gov. Ron DeSantis: Media Should Apologize for Causing ‘Frenzy’ Over Beach Reopenings,"Gov. Ron DeSantis suggested members of the national news media should apologize to mayors in Duval County, Florida for hyping criticism of decisions by local jurisdictions to reopen some beaches in mid-April.

The beaches in Duval County were reopened only under social distancing rules.

Seventeen days later, DeSantis presented data that shows Duval County remains among the lowest of the state’s major metropolitan areas when it comes to new Coronavirus cases.

He also showed graphs depicting significant declines in coronavirus hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and the use of ventilators in Duval County.

“I think apologies can be sent to the city of Jacksonville attention Mayor [Lenny] Curry,” said DeSantis, addressing members of the national media. “You may want to CC the mayors of Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach and Atlantic Beach. But I won’t hold my breath on that happening.”

“The facts are that since this has happened hospitalizations, ICU, rate of positivity, [patients on] ventilators — that has all declined. Those people were wrong and the folks in Duval County behaved appropriately,” he added.

DeSantis called on reporters to focus on the “truth” instead of causing a “frenzy” and “allowing things to get carried away.”

Watch his presentation here:

As he was speaking, a screen showed alarmist headlines about the beach reopenings in the New York Times, Washington Post and other newspapers as well as an image from a critical segment on the topic aired on Anderson Cooper’s CNN show.

“#FloridaMorons trends after people flock to reopened Florida beaches,” was the title of a Washington Post piece.

CBS News critically reported that “Mayor Lenny Curry reopened beaches and parks in Jacksonville, Florida on Friday, after Governor Ron DeSantis gave the green light for them to reopen, despite the state hitting a record number of coronavirus cases.”

The New York Times, Washington Post and other media outlets used similar images that show many people walking on a Jacksonville beach. It not clear from the pictures whether those photographed were violating the social distancing rules. The closeup images seem to show people keeping distance but those who can be seen were not wearing masks or other face coverings

“Of course, you look at the photo that is used. It’s like get that lens right in that area so it looks like there are so many people crowded out there,” DeSantis quipped.

Many of the same national media outlets critical of DeSantis and Duval County politicians had nothing to say about the decision by three Democratic governors at around the same time — New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont – to reopen marinas and boatyards also under social distancing rules.

There has also been a lack of criticism about Manhattan’s Central Park being open to the public while visitor centers and playgrounds have been closed until further notice. People magazine recently published photographs showing crowds in Central Park clearly breaking the “six feet apart” guidelines, with many not wearing face masks.

The beach reopenings in northeastern Florida controversially led to Miami Herald metro columnist Fabiola Santiago tweeting that Florida residents packing beaches “should work nicely to thin the ranks” of supporters of President Donald Trump and DeSantis.

Santiago later deleted the offending tweet and issued an apology. Mindy Marques, publisher and executive editor of the Miami Herald, also issued an apology and said the newspaper would “follow up internally.”

['Simon Kent'],2020-05-04,"W.H.O. Continues to Obey China, Ignores Taiwan Coronavirus Success","Taiwan has “not yet” received an invitation to join a meeting this month of the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) lead decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, the government said on Monday.

The island state’s government said it would still strive to take part regardless, ABC News in Australia reported.

China forced Taiwan out of the global body in 2016 after the election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist. It has blocked every effort since for Taiwan to regain even observer status at W.H.O.’s annual policy meeting, insisting Taiwan should not receive any considerations or honors that would be afforded to a full nation-state.

Taiwan’s exclusion from W.H.O. membership has understandably infuriated Taipei, which says its absence has created a glaring gap in the global fight against the coronavirus.

Taiwan has been praised for its handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. According to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University, Taiwan has 436 confirmed coronavirus cases and only six deaths.

In March, assistant director-general at the W.H.O., Bruce Aylward, dodged a journalist’s question on Taiwan’s pariah status, confirming allegations the world body was too deferential to China. Watch that exchange below:

﻿

The W.H.O. said last week that due to the epidemic, the World Health Assembly meeting is expected to take the shape of a three-hour video conference rather than the usual full-blown meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.

According to the ABC report, Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the government had “not yet received an invitation from W.H.O.” for that briefing and was “still awaiting” it so a delegation could share the island’s experience in fighting the outbreak.

Meanwhile Australia is pushing ahead with its call to have Taiwan return to the W.H.O. fold, as Breitbart News reported.

Last Friday an Australian ministry spokesman said the global coronavirus pandemic needed a global response, and there should be a close working relationship between the W.H.O. and all “health authorities,” including Taiwan.

Australia is not alone in seeking immediate reformation of the ailing body:

C-SPAN

The nation should be able to participate as an observer or a guest, the spokesman added, and on the evidence would add value to an organization in drastic need of reform.

The government of Taiwan attempted to warn the U.N.-led W.H.O. of the deadly potential of the Wuhan coronavirus as far back as December 2019, but the W.H.O. failed to share Taiwan’s findings on the virus with the world, the country’s U.S. office confirmed to Breitbart News last month.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/05/04/w-h-o-continues-to-obey-china-ignores-taiwan-coronavirus-success/
['Breitbart News'],,Intel Report: China Hid Coronavirus’ Severity to Hoard Supplies,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak — and how contagious the disease is — to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that China was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric against China coincides with administration critics saying the government’s response to the virus was inadequate and slow. President Donald Trump’s political opponents have accused the president and his administration of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

The analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by “denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data,” the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus “was a contagion” for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad — and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China’s changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report.

Trump has speculated that China could have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible “mistake.” His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, “Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories.”

['Matthew Boyle'],2020-05-03,Congressman: Pelosi Blocking Investigation into China Coronavirus Origins,"Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) told Breitbart News this weekend that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would rather investigate President Donald Trump again than focus on the actual origins of the Chinese coronavirus and U.S. tax dollars that went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology from which intelligence officials increasingly believe the virus leaked.

Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Reschenthaler discussed his efforts to investigate tax dollars that flowed through a New York firm to the Wuhan lab. He said that Pelosi and House Democrats are not interested in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable and, instead, want to focus their oversight efforts on politically harming President Trump again just like they tried and failed with the partisan impeachment last year and earlier this year.

“We should have an investigative body looking at these grants, but Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that,” Reschenthaler said. “So you have myself and House Republicans. I can tell you I’m going to continue to look into these grants. I’m going to continue to look into the Department of Homeland Security as well to see what grants are going from there to China. I’m also looking at defunding the World Health Organization and we can talk about that as well. But the bottom line of the Democrats’ behavior is this: They hate this president so badly that they would rather side with the Chinese Communist Party than defend Americans and defend our spending and spend wisely and just be honest. That is their hatred for President Trump and disdain for President Trump’s supporters.”

LISTEN:

Breitbart · Breitbart News Saturday – Rep. Guy Reschenthaler – May 2, 2020 “We should have an investigative body looking at these grants, but Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that,” Reschenthaler said. “So you have myself and House Republicans. I can tell you I’m going to continue to look into these grants. I’m going to continue to look into the Department of Homeland Security as well to see what grants are going from there to China. I’m also looking at defunding the World Health Organization and we can talk about that as well. But the bottom line of the Democrats’ behavior is this: They hate this president so badly that they would rather side with the Chinese Communist Party than defend Americans and defend our spending and spend wisely and just be honest. That is their hatred for President Trump and disdain for President Trump’s supporters.”

Reschenthaler wrote a letter this week to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper inquiring about a Pentagon grant to EcoHealth Alliance, Inc., a New York firm that has had a history of funding the Wuhan Institute of Virology with subgrants from American taxpayers. The Pentagon grant the congressman was inquiring about was for research into bat-borne zoonotic diseases and their potential as weapons of mass destruction or biological weapons. While it is unclear if that grant saw U.S. taxpayer money flowing from it out to the Wuhan lab, it is known that another grant that EcoHealth Alliance received did partially spend U.S. tax dollars in the Chinese lab.

That grant, from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — in particular the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is run by the now-famous Dr. Anthony Fauci — saw U.S. tax dollars sent to EcoHealth Alliance for researching coronaviruses from bats flow out to the Chinese lab in Wuhan. Some of the money went to other labs around the world too, an NIH official confirmed to Breitbart News last week. But the NIH was so concerned about the money and this lab in Wuhan that the government notified EcoHealth Alliance that it would be investigating the matter and that any funds to the Wuhan lab must be halted while the investigation occurred.

“The NIH funded EcoHealth Alliance, which then, in turn, turned around and partially funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Reschenthaler told Breitbart News. “The DOD also gave EcoHealth Alliance $6.5 million in a grant, and like you said, that grant was to understand bat-borne zoonotic disease in context with weapons of mass destruction. So what I’m trying to find out is whether or not the DOD funding that went to EcoHealth also went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We know that the NIH funding did, and we also know that all money is fungible, but I want to see if we can trace that money to Wuhan to see how much and to what extent the DOD and American taxpayers actually funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”

What is perhaps most interesting about all this is how little the Democrats on Capitol Hill seem to care about the origins of the virus in Wuhan, China, or about U.S. taxpayer dollars flowing to this lab in China. Many Democrats have brushed off holding China accountable for the virus and, instead, intend to focus their efforts on attacking President Trump over the Chinese coronavirus. Pelosi, whose Articles of Impeachment effort against Trump failed in grand fashion this year as the U.S. Senate acquitted the president, has even launched the creation of a select committee to investigate the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic — a select committee that Republicans are considering boycotting.

The members Pelosi named to the committee last week are highly partisan Democrats. First and foremost, Pelosi named House Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) — the Democrat who publicly mused that the chaos of the pandemic provided Democrats an opportunity to remake America in their vision — to chair it. Then she named several others directly involved in the failed effort to impeach President Trump, including House Oversight Committee chairwoman Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and House Financial Services Committee chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). Maloney and Waters chair two of the committees that were involved in the partisan impeachment inquiry of President Trump.

The others — House Small Business Committee chairwoman Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) and Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Bill Foster (D-IL), and Andy Kim (D-NJ) — all voted for impeachment as well. Raskin, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, gained particular prominence during hearings last year.

As such, Rep. Kevin McCarthy — the House GOP leader — has said he does not believe Republicans will participate in the sham investigation because he sees it simply as “another impeachment committee.”

Reschenthaler said on Breitbart News Saturday that if Americans want Congress to have a real investigation into the origins of the Chinese coronavirus and hearings about their tax dollars going to this lab in Wuhan, Republicans would need to retake the House majority in November and commence those hearings next year.

“It’s imperative that we as House Republicans take back the House in this next election because Nancy Pelosi and the far-left Democrats are thwarting everything we do,” Reschenthaler said. “I do have to say I cringe when the media says ‘Nancy Pelosi and the Squad’ because that minimizes how far left this party has gone. It’s just not the Squad. It’s not just Nancy Pelosi. It’s most of their members. Look at the Green New Deal. When that was floated, half of their co-sponsors were on the Green New Deal. Most of these Democrats vote 90 plus percent of the time with [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]. This party has moved drastically to the left to the point of siding with the CCP over Americans. They don’t want to get to the bottom of these grants and they also don’t want my resolution run on the floor about defunding the World Health Organization or at least getting Dr. Tedros to resign and getting an international organization to investigate how the World Health Organization was either grossly negligent in dealing with the Wuhan virus or how they worked hand-in-glove with the Chinese Communist Party in trying to cover up the virus early on. But that’s the extent of their hatred, again, of this president and his supporters where they will not run these bills and they will not do these investigations because, again, they would rather side with the CCP than do the right thing.”

To retake the House majority, Republicans need to win just 18 net seats back from Democrats. There are 30 districts across America that Trump won in 2016 currently represented by a Democrat, so the prospect is very possible that the GOP could flip the House back. In the meantime, however, while Democrats on Capitol Hill dither in partisan politics, the Trump administration and the U.S. Intelligence Community are investigating these matters, Reschenthaler said.

“The Intel Community hasn’t ruled out the virus may have originated in the lab,” Reschenthaler said. “We know that. That’s coming from the Intel Community. We also know that the NIH in a letter to EcoHealth stated that they believe — this is again the NIH letter I’m stating — that they believe the virus may have originated in the lab. That was the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Lab IV. We know that. But I think whether or not this disease came from a bat through a wet market or it came from a lab, we’ve got to see where it originated and we’ve got to see what we can do to make sure we stop these pandemics in the future. That could be something like encouraging other nations to stop interactions at wet markets, which should be happening anyhow. If it originated in a lab and somehow leaked from the lab, we shouldn’t be funding labs that study virology and weapons of mass destruction in terms of biological weapons. We shouldn’t fund these labs unless they have procedures in place where the disease won’t leak out and kill 60,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands around the world. This is a very responsible thing to do as good stewards of taxpayer money.”

Reschenthaler also hopes to get answers as to whether the Chinese Communist Party, while it was getting these U.S. tax dollars into the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was even being forthcoming with U.S. officials about research that was compiled there on such coronaviruses, including potentially the one plaguing the planet right now.

“I’d like to add, as we get to the bottom of this, I’d like to see what information we were getting back from the Institute of Virology in Wuhan because something tells me the Chinese Communist Party was taking the money from EcoHealth Alliance — which was, again, a large part came from the United States and our taxpayers — then doing this research, and I don’t know if they were giving us any actual data or scientific findings from what we were funding,” Reschenthaler said. “They certainly didn’t allow American doctors and scientists into Wuhan at the start of this disease. They’ve kept us shut out for a large part. So I want to see if we were being taken advantage of. I suspect that we were by the Chinese Communist Party, and I want to see in the future, when we do give these grants, there is transparency and we get the research that comes from us funding these labs.”

['Ben Kew'],2020-05-04,Report: Third Russian Health Worker Falls from Hospital Window,"A paramedic who complained about being forced to work after contracting the Chinese coronavirus is currently in critical condition after mysteriously falling from a hospital window in western Russia this weekend.

The Moscow Times reports that 37-year-old Alexander Shulepov fell from the second floor of a hospital in the rural Voronezh and suffered a skull fracture, which has left him in critical condition. Voronezh is located 500 kilometers south of Moscow; he was being treated for coronavirus symptoms.

Police claim to be investigating his fall.

Last month, Shulepov and his colleague Alexander Kosyakin filmed a video complaining that authorities in the Novaya Usman village hospital were forcing him the work despite the fact he had tested positive for the virus. The complaint occurred after reports surfaced that the Kremlin recently forced third-year medical students to work during the pandemic or face academic and professional consequences.

Days later, he reportedly released another video walking back his comments, arguing that he was in an “emotional state.” The video also featured Igor Potanin, the head doctor of the Novousmanskaya hospital, who insisted his medical staff were being provided with sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE).

“I spoke about this to the department’s employees: I won’t let anyone go to outpatients or inpatients if we don’t have enough means of protection, I told them I’d go myself there, but I will not send anyone,” Potanin said in the video.

In a statement to CNN, Kosyakin confirmed details about his colleague’s condition.

“[Shulepov] is an intensive care unit, as far as I know in a serious condition, last time I spoke to him was on the 30th of April, we checked in with each other,” Kosyakin told CNN. “He felt fine, he was getting ready to get discharged from the hospital … and all of a sudden this happened, it’s not clear why and what for, so many questions that I don’t even have the answer to.” Kosyakin reportedly faces criminal charges for violating Russia’s recently passed misinformation law, which carries prison sentences of up to five years for spreading “fake news” about the ongoing pandemic. Russian authorities have reported around 145,000 cases of the virus so far but just 1,356 deaths, an abnormally low number compared with other countries.

Shulepov is the third doctor to have reportedly plunged from a hospital building in the past two weeks, with the other two both dying of their injuries. The most recent of these victims was Elena Nepomnyashchaya, the acting head doctor of a hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, who died days after an alleged fall from a window at the hospital she was in charge of. She had recently complained about her staff being forced to treat coronavirus patients without sufficient PPE.

Dr. Natalya Lebedeva — the head of the emergency medical service at Star City, where the majority of Russia’s cosmonauts are trained — allegedly committed suicide on April 24 by jumping from the building after failing to prevent an outbreak. The hospital called her death a “tragic accident.”

Falling or defenestration from buildings appear to have become a signature manner of death for numerous government dissenters in Russia over the past decade. Before the recent spate of falls, the latest case was that of the 32-year-old investigative journalist Maxim Borodin, thrown out of a fourth-floor window in April 2018 as he was investigating Russia’s military involvement in Syria.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-04,Millions Travel Across China to Celebrate May Day Holiday,"Chinese state media on Monday was brimming with upbeat accounts of travelers crossing the country and flooding into tourist attractions to celebrate May Day, a major holiday for the Communist country.

The energetic celebrations were presented as a milestone in China’s recovery from the coronavirus epidemic.

China’s state-run Xinhua news network put the spotlight on Lieshen, a mountain village that made May Day into a big debut for its rebranding as a rural tourist attraction.

“With the help of local authorities, villagers turn farmhouses into homestay hotels and make rural landscape [into] scenic spots [to] attract tourists,” Xinhua said, using aerial photographs to show how picturesque the town has become, and how satisfyingly full its parking lots were for the May Day holiday.

Another Xinhua article reported over a million visitors at Shanghai’s 130 major tourist attractions during the first two days of the five-day May Day holiday, signaling a “growing travel and leisure demand.”

According to the report, Shanghai tourists are “required to wear face masks, show their health QR codes, and have their body temperatures taken for their safety.” The QR codes are generated by a mandatory health tracking application Chinese citizens must install on their smartphones.

Xinhua counted 23 million domestic trips on the first day of the May Day holiday, generating about $1.38 billion in revenue. 7.37 million of those travelers were packed onto trains, which recorded their highest daily number of passengers since the Lunar New Year holiday in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.

About 70 percent of China’s tourist attractions were said to be open, although they were required to operate at no more than 30 percent of their optimum capacity.

China Daily on Monday celebrated tourism in Hubei province, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, “springing back to life.”

Twenty-two major tourist attractions were open in Hubei on Friday, drawing over 520,000 visitors over the weekend for their “first public holiday since the regional lockdown was lifted.” This total was down about 83 percent from May Day 2019 due to the 30 percent capacity limit placed on tourist sites. In Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, tourism was down 58 percent from last year.

China Daily reported Hubei’s government established a special fund to help tourism enterprises resume operations after the lockdown. Private and public institutions have been urged to give their employees a half-day off on Friday every week over the summer to boost tourism. Medical workers who traveled to Hubei to help with the coronavirus emergency have been offered free admission to all tourist attractions for life.

['Charlie Spiering'],2020-05-04,"In Mandarin, White House Celebrates Chinese Populist Heroes","The White House on Monday further challenged China’s coronavirus response narrative by praising heroes punished by the Chinese government for telling the truth about the coronavirus pandemic.

Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger addressed The University of Virginia’s Miller Center in a video, speaking in Mandarin about the story of Dr. Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old Chinese doctor who was detained by authorities after sounding the alarm about the dangers of the coronavirus on December 31. Skeptics questioned whether physical violence at the hands of Chinese authorities further damaged Li’s health after he emerged from his arrest in a weakened condition.

“Dr. Li wasn’t a demagogue in search of a new ideology that might save China, he was an ophthalmologist and a young father who committed a small act of bravery and then a big act of bravery,” Pottinger said, detailing his story.

Li was detained by Chinese authorities and forced to sign a letter renouncing his remarks.

China’s central government denounced Li’s warning as “rumor-mongering.”

He ultimately went public with his experience with the virus and the Chinese authorities, sounding a warning that reverberated around the globe.

When Li died in February from the virus, he was hailed as a hero in China while Chinese authorities censored the online revolt against the government for silencing his warning.

“The whole world paid close attention,” Pottinger said, calling Li’s death “the loss of a relative for people around the world.”

Pottinger also hailed citizen journalists like Chen Quiushi, Fang Bin, and Li Zehua who went missing after he spread the truth about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.

“When small acts of bravery are stamped out by governments, big acts of bravery follow,” Pottinger said.

Pottinger hailed the modern whistleblowers of the coronavirus as inheritors of the Chinese May Fourth student protest movement of 1919 that resisted oppressive Chinese rulers.

“Let me break the rule against discussing ‘isms’ to ask whether China today would benefit from a little less nationalism and a little more populism,” he said.

He continued:

Democrat populism is less about the left versus right than top versus bottom. It’s about reminding a few that they need the consent of the many to govern. When a privileged few grow too remote and self-interested, populism is what pulls them back or pitches them overboard. It has a kinetic energy.

He cited the 2015 Brexit vote, the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, and Thomas Jefferson’s own Declaration of Independence in 1776 as examples of healthy populism.

“It is an admonition to the powerful of this country to remember who they’re supposed to work for: America First,” he concluded.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/04/in-mandarin-white-house-celebrates-chinese-populist-heroes-telling-the-truth-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-05,"Hong Kong to Reopen Bars, Theaters as Coronavirus Cases Dwindle","Hong Kong will relax limits on gatherings in public places starting Friday, as the city’s number of new Chinese coronavirus cases has not increased since April, Hong Kong news broadcaster RTHK reported on Tuesday.

People will be allowed to go out in public in groups of up to eight. Bars, gyms, cinemas, beauty salons, massage parlors, and various other entertainment venues will be allowed to reopen from May 8, with some restrictions on their operations to remain in place until May 21. Karaoke bars and nightclubs will remain closed for an additional two weeks.

Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the lifting of restrictions on Tuesday, the same day that the city recorded no new coronavirus cases, with the total number of local infections remaining 1,040. As of Tuesday, Hong Kong had not reported a new local case of coronavirus (non-imported) since April 19.

Before Tuesday’s announcement, people who gathered in groups of more than four in a public place, indoors or outdoors, faced a maximum fine of up to HK$25,000 [U.S. $3224] and six months in prison. This strict measure was put in place starting March 29 when the city was experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, according to RTHK.

Now that Hong Kong’s coronavirus outbreak has seemed to stabilize, the city’s authorities say they are ready to start opening the city back up again.

At a coronavirus pandemic-related briefing titled “Hope on the Horizon” on Tuesday, Lam said it would be “unrealistic” for Hong Kong’s social distancing measures to remain in place until there are no new coronavirus cases whatsoever. She added that people have grown impatient under the city’s lockdown and that businesses have been eager to resume operations.

According to the briefing, restaurants may allow up to eight people to sit at the same table starting Friday, up from four currently. Other restrictions on restaurants, such as spacing tables at least 1.5 meters apart, will remain in place for now. Bars will reopen on Friday, but must operate at 50 percent of their capacity; no live bands or dancing in bars will be allowed for now.

Lam also confirmed an earlier report that Hong Kong schools will reopen in phases beginning May 27.

On April 26, when the ban on large gathering was still firmly in place, hundreds of people converged at a Hong Kong shopping mall for a pro-democracy demonstration. Hong Kong’s local government has grown increasingly authoritarian in recent years, prompting its citizens to organize pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the city in recent months.

King, as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he needs to see the intelligence Trump and Pompeo have, adding if the committee does not get access to it, “then that raises serious questions about the basis of those assertions.”

“I think what we should believe is what the intelligence community is telling us, and I haven’t seen any recent intelligence on this in the last month or so,” King told Berman. “So, you know … if the president and the secretary of state have intelligence on this, then as a member of the intelligence committee I want to see it. I’m entitled to see classified material. there are no limits on that kind of material being shared with the intelligence committees of the Congress. So, it bothers me that for the president and the secretary of state to assert in such certainty, in fact, I think the president said a high degree of certainty without at least sharing with the Intelligence Committee on a closed classified basis what the basis of that is. And like I say, I haven’t seen it. I can’t contradict it, except I’m damn sure going to try to see it over the next week or so. And if we can’t get it, then that raises serious questions about the basis of those assertions.”

['Penny Starr'],2020-05-04,"Official: After Giving Billions to W.H.O., U.S. Can Use Other Partners","Senior State Department officials said on Monday that President Donald Trump’s directive to pause funding the World Health Organization while investigating how the United Nation’s global health agency handled the coronavirus pandemic was justified and that the United States can partner with other non-governmental organizations to implement its foreign aid around the world.

During a conference call with reporters, State Department officials noted that the United States has spent the most money fighting the coronavirus pandemic.

“The United States continues to be the undisputed leader in foreign assistance,” James Richardson, director of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources at the U.S. Department of State, said in opening remarks during the call.

Richardson said that the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have dedicated $775 million in emergency health, humanitarian, economic, and development assistance to fight the coronavirus pandemic, in addition to the $2.4 billion appropriated by Congress.

Richardson said the U.S. represents “49 percent of all government and multilateral assistance” dedicated to the battle against the pandemic.

Breitbart News asked about the United States’ financial contributions to the W.H.O. given the Trump administration’s investigation into the global entity.

“So over the past 20 years, we’ve contributed over $5 billion to the W.H.O.,” a senior State Department official said. “The past 10, that number has been 3.2, and last year we contributed almost $400 million.”

“So, so far the U.S. has used the W.H.O. as an implementing partner around the world for about $40 million of our assistance,” the official said. “So what the president saw was that W.H.O. was was not being an accountable, transparent partner, and as such it’s really important for us to make sure when you do foreign assistance that you always look at who is the best partner in order to get the job done.”

“The president rightfully … has concerns about the W.H.O., and that’s what this review is about,” the official said, adding that there are many other non-government agencies around the globe that can be used as an “implementing partner” aside from W.H.O.

“The W.H.O. is actually a fairly small implementing partner for the United States,” the official said. “We give $18-20 billion worth of health and humanitarian assistance nearly every year.”

“And so with the WHO receiving 400 million of that [last year], that’s like two percent of our total health and humanitarian assistance going through the W.H.O. to implement our programs.”

“We are absolutely committed to making sure every dollar is well spent and well accounted for, and that’s what we’re continuing to do every day with our COVID resources and all the rest of our global health and humanitarian assistance resources,” the official said.

China was only mentioned during the call in reference to how little it contributes globally to humanitarian and other aid but not the role the Trump administration believes W.H.O. played in not disseminating critical data about the coronavirus and its origin and spread inside and outside of that communist country.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-04,"Russia Records 10,000+ Coronavirus Cases for Two Straight Days","Russia’s new coronavirus cases increased by over 10,000 for the second straight day on Monday, the Moscow Times reported, cementing its status as a pandemic hotspot.

Russian health officials confirmed 10,581 new coronavirus infections over the last 24 hours, just 52 fewer than on Sunday, bringing the country’s official number of cases to 145,268. The increase on Monday pushed Russia to the top of the list of European countries reporting the highest number of new cases, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).

On April 30, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin confirmed that he tested positive for coronavirus, making him the highest-ranking Russian official known to have contracted the virus.

“I have just learned that the test on the coronavirus I took was positive,” the prime minister said during a video call with Russian President Vladimir Putin shared on Russian TV.

Mishustin recommended First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov supplant him as he headed into self-isolation and Putin agreed.

“What’s happening to you can happen to anyone, and I’ve always been saying this,” Putin told him. “You are a very active person.”

Mishustin used the opportunity to urge all Russians to take the coronavirus seriously and to stay home as an 11-day, extended May holiday approached.

Russia observes several public holidays in early May, including Victory Day on May 9 to celebrate Russia’s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. This year’s Victory Day marks the 75th anniversary and Putin had planned a major celebration in Moscow’s famous Red Square with world leaders in attendance and a grand military procession.

Russia’s fierce coronavirus outbreak has forced the nation to cancel the parade, which Putin says he has postponed. Instead, military aircraft will fly over major cities to mark the day. On Monday, fighter jets were spotted flying over Moscow, the nation’s capital, as they rehearsed for the event, AFP reports.

The Moscow Times said about half the total coronavirus cases in Russia are located in Moscow. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reportedly said “the threat is apparently on the rise” and urged residents to follow stay-at-home orders and anti-coronavirus measures over the May holidays.

Last week, Moscow said it would begin constructing temporary hospitals to hold a total of 10,000 beds for coronavirus patients, in response to the increased need. Putin also announced last week that the sharp increase in coronavirus cases in Russia has left the country with a shortage of medical gear including personal protective equipment (PPE).

Despite the surge in cases, Russian officials have argued its fatality rate remained relatively low for a country of its size and population. At press time on Monday, Russia had reported 1,356 coronavirus deaths. Russian officials have credited their quick, aggressive actions – such as closing the country’s borders early and allegedly widespread testing and tracking of infections – for what they consider a low number. Despite this, critics have doubted Russia’s officially reported coronavirus numbers in recent weeks.

As many western European countries begin to ease their coronavirus lockdowns, Russia has extended its own until May 11. The Russian government has indicated that, after May 11, it could gradually lift quarantine measures across the country, which include restrictions on people’s movement meant to curb the spread of the virus.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/russia-records-10000-coronavirus-cases-two-straight-days/
['Ben Kew'],2020-05-04,South Korea to Reopen Schools Next Week Following Virus Response,"The government of South Korea announced plans on Monday to reopen schools next week, citing a diminished threat from the Chinese coronavirus.

South Korea has postponed the beginning of the spring semester four times so far since imposing social distancing measures in March. Yet with the average daily number of new cases now close to zero, education authorities said they are ready to start phasing in the renewal of classes based on age group.

Schools are scheduled to reopen across the country starting May 20, two months after the government closed them in response to the pandemic.

“We’re now preparing for the opening of schools while managing the daily risks of the disease,” Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae said at a press briefing Monday. “If a student turns out to be infected with the virus, health authorities will take the necessary action and the school will switch to online classes.”

Experts consider South Korea to have implemented among the most effective responses to the coronavirus, successfully introducing mass testing, intensive contact tracing, and symptom tracking apps aimed at limiting it spread.

Health authorities are nevertheless urging caution to protect the country’s some 5.5 million elementary, middle, and high school students, requiring them to conduct mock drills and drawing up guidelines in the case of any resurgence in infections.

The current plan is for high school students to return to school on May 13 to resume preparation for the highly competitive annual college entrance exam in December. Younger students will resume their studies in stages between May 20 and June 1.

Under the new measures, both students and teachers will be required to wear masks except for during mealtimes, regularly wipe their desks, and maintain distance as they move around the premises. School authorities will also need to carry out the disinfection of surfaces, temperature checks, and the rearranging of seating.

“At our schools, we must adopt a new lifestyle in line with [social distancing rules],” Yoo explained. “Our schools cannot return to the state before Covid-19, and so all us educators must be prepared to operate schools in new ways.”

The government also plans to ease various social distancing restrictions on Wednesday for society as a whole, allowing public services such as libraries and museums to reopen in stages. They are also setting up hundreds of respiratory clinics nationwide as preparation for a potential second wave of infections in the future.

“The plan is to make [these clinics] a model of public-private cooperation,” said Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip at the press conference. “A detailed plan and guidelines will be created in early May in coordination with medical professionals.”

According to official data, South Korea has so far recorded 10,801 cases and 252 deaths, a relatively low figure given its proximity to China. Of that total, at least 9,217 people recovered from the virus, while 1,332 are currently being treated for its symptoms.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-04,Chinese Media: Pompeo ‘Bluffing’ by Linking Coronavirus to Wuhan Lab,"Chinese state media on Monday claimed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was merely “bluffing” when he said on Sunday there is “enormous evidence” that the coronavirus originated at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.

Pompeo made the remarks that infuriated the CCP when Martha Raddatz of ABC News asked if he has “seen anything that gives you high confidence” that the coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

“Martha, there is enormous evidence that that’s where this began. We’ve said from the beginning that this was a virus that originated in Wuhan, China. We took a lot of grief for that from the outside, but I think the whole world can see now,” Pompeo replied.

“Remember, China has a history of infecting the world and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,” Pompeo continued. He continued:

These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab. And so while the Intelligence Community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

Pompeo also said the “best experts so far seem to think it was man-made.”

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) through its Global Times newspaper demanded to see the evidence Pompeo referred to and accused the United States of engaging in “unprecedented propaganda warfare” by constantly reminding the world where the deadly pandemic came from:

Since Pompeo said his claims are supported by “enormous evidence,” then he should present this so-called evidence to the world, and especially to the American public who he continually tries to fool. The truth is that Pompeo does not have any evidence, and during Sunday’s interview, he was bluffing. The Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The most urgent tasks for international communities are to prevent the virus from spreading and to save lives while restarting the world economy. Ironically, Washington has put forth the weakest efforts in accomplishing the aforementioned tasks. As the US presidential election campaigns are underway, the Trump administration has implemented a strategy designed to divert attention from the incompetence it has displayed in fighting the pandemic. It is clear that their goal is to blame China for the pandemic by pinpointing the country as the source of COVID-19. The origin of the virus is of serious scientific concern. So far, not one world-renowned scientist has accused the Wuhan Institute of Virology of leaking the virus. US intelligence agencies, acting on orders from US President Donald Trump, have been involved with the investigation. Pompeo has recently declared that he has “enormous evidence” about a so-called “lab leak.” As a result, what was originally a scientific question, has been transformed into a vicious attack fueled by politics, intelligence, and diplomacy. Such filthy behavior defies the essence of science to mislead the general public. If Washington has solid evidence, then it should let research institutes and scientists examine and verify it. Another option would be to have intelligence agencies release a detailed report on the origin of the virus, which would help the White House keep its fabrications moving forward. Washington has chosen not to pursue either of those options and instead is utilizing a politician like Pompeo to bluff US society with so-called “enormous evidence.”

The Global Times ranted at length that Pompeo was “sacrificing his credibility as a politician” in a “reckless pursuit” to distract from how terrible the coronavirus epidemic has become in the United States.

Very few health experts outside of China believe the CCP has been truthful at any point during the pandemic in reporting how many infections and deaths it caused. One reason the Chinese government lies with such determination about the scope of the pandemic is so it can claim, as the Global Times did again on Monday, that other countries did a much worse job of fighting the virus than China, and they are only blaming China for unleashing the pandemic to distract from their shortcomings.

Raddatz mentioned another reason the CCP concealed the true scale of the Wuhan virus outbreak during her interview with Pompeo on Sunday: U.S. intelligence officials believe “the Chinese government ‘intentionally concealed the severity of COVID-19 from the international community in early January while it stockpiled medical supplies.’”

“In terms of international concealing, I assume you think they did that intentionally to keep as many masks for themselves as possible?” she asked Pompeo. He replied that she had the facts “just about right.”

Raddatz was referring to a report produced by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on May 1 and described in a report from the Associated Press on Sunday.

The report, which was not classified but was marked “for official use only,” noted that while China was downplaying the severity of the outbreak at the beginning of the year, it also “increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies.”

The DHS report said that China’s “imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply” at the same time it was telling the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) that the virus could not be spread by human contact. Perhaps not coincidentally, W.H.O. has consistently described surgical masks as unnecessary protection for people who are not already infected by the coronavirus, even as China was attempting to monopolize the planetary supply of masks.

For some reason, the AP decided to insert a vague editorial defense of the Chinese Communist Party in the middle of its report on the DHS analysis: “Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government’s missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information and officials hesitant to report bad news. There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world’s medical supplies.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/chinese-media-pompeo-bluffing-linking-coronavirus-wuhan-lab/
['John Hayward'],2020-05-04,Chinese State Media Calls Canada a ‘Giant Baby’ for ‘Bashing’ W.H.O.,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) used its Global Times state newspaper to lash out at Canada on Monday, insulting Canada as a “giant baby” throwing a temper tantrum because it dared to join the United States in “bashing” the World Health Organization (W.H.O.).

The specific Canadian action that enraged the CCP was a summons issued by the House of Commons to Bruce Aylward, a Canadian citizen who works as a senior adviser to W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

The Global Times forgot to mention that the Canadian legislature cordially invited Aylward to address it twice, on April 14 and May 1, and only issued the summons on Friday after those invitations were refused. Canadian members of parliament even said they would be willing to accept a reasonable substitute for Aylward if he is unavailable, but W.H.O. simply declined their invitations.

In the CCP’s mind, any questioning of Chinese influence over the World Health Organization is completely out of bounds, and Canadian politicians would only ask such questions because they seek to curry favor with the evil United States:

Canada is again becoming an accomplice in the US “buck-passing” campaign and scapegoating either WHO or China for its flawed handling of the epidemic to cover up its systematic loopholes. By exerting pressure on high-level medical expert Bruce Aylward, some Canadi-an politicians fawn on the US by expressing their dissatisfaction with the WHO and express doubts about China in dealing with the epidemic in the earlier stage. Like the US, Canada acts like a country with a self-centered “giant baby” mentality who refuses to accept the fact which it is unwilling to believe. The coronavirus had struck a blow to their once vaunted “superior” capabilities in responding to public health crises. The death rate from coronavirus in Canada, higher than that of China, crushed their illusions and sense of superiority. Canada’s deep skepticism reflects its extreme ideological anxiety and frustration.

This has become the standard insulting line taken by the CCP toward all of its critics: foreign officials only accuse China of lying and exerting malign influence over W.H.O. to distract from their own poor response to the coronavirus. China’s coronavirus propaganda campaign certainly could not be mistaken for a diplomatic charm offensive.

The Global Times also insinuated the Canadian legislature is somehow racist and arrogant for wanting testimony from a Canadian who works for W.H.O.:

Their narcissistic view of their own system leads them to expect that all things can go in line with their imagination. If not, they will suspect that there must be something wrong. They are still reluctant to wake up even though such blind confidence has dragged them into chaos and made them bear the consequences. They are pointing a finger at a renowned epidemiologist who led a group of WHO experts to China for a joint mission on COVID-19 in February because Aylward revealed some facts those politicians long balked at. Aylward praised China’s coronavirus prevention work, saying potential patients were well-organized and tested quickly at a press conference in Beijing in February. But some in Canada continue to hold on to their prejudice against China, ignoring some of the key elements of China’s success in fighting the epidemic, which Aylward summarized and applauded. Canada should invite Aylward back to the country for more experience sharing and consultations, but not for being blamed for its own mismanagement.

Taiwan News on Sunday reported that Aylward has been summoned to participate in a “mandatory video conference” with Canadian legislators, during which he will be asked to “explain WHO misinformation on person-to-person transmission of the virus, as well as the use of masks,” a topic upon which W.H.O. has issued some confusing statements.

Taiwan News also mentioned an infamous videoconference interview Aylward had with a Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) reporter in early April. When the reporter asked if the Chinese Communist Party used its influence with W.H.O. to block membership for Taiwan, which has attributed its exemplary success at fighting the coronavirus to ignoring Chinese disinformation passed through W.H.O., Aylward pretended not to hear the question, then flatly refused to answer when it was repeated, and finally disconnected from the interview.

Hong Kong’s Beijing-controlled government later reprimanded RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong for asking Aylward about Taiwan, on the grounds that such questions violate the “One China” principle that treats Taiwan as a Chinese Communist possession.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/chinese-state-media-calls-canada-giant-baby-for-bashing-world-health-organization/

From Fox News:

Last week, reports showed that 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. In the coming months, the national unemployment rate is likely to hit 16 percent — or even higher. There haven’t been this many people out of work in the United States since the Great Depression.

Missouri should be applauded for recognizing the massive harm that CCP has inflicted.

…

American businesses — especially small businesses — are facing an economic crisis we haven’t seen in our lifetimes. The road to recovery will likely be long and rocky. As Missouri Attorney General Schmitt said last week about China, “They are responsible for this and the responsibility lies directly at their feet.”

['David Ng'],2020-05-04,USC Creating COVID-19 Surveillance System That Will Score Citizens,"China launched its notorious social credit system last year to watch over its own citizens and mete out punishment based on personal behavior and loyalty to the Communist Party.

Now three prominent U.S. universities are using taxpayer money to create a similar type of surveillance network designed to monitor Americans and assign them scores based on their exposure to the Wuhan coronavirus.

Tech news outlet dot.LA recently reported that researchers at the University of Southern California, Emory University, and the University of Texas Health Science Center have received a federal grant to create a mobile app for contact tracing the novel coronavirus. The system will track a person’s real-time location and symptoms, and calculate a personal COVID-19 risk score.

USC’s Cyrus Shahabi, chair of the computer science department, told dot.LA that the universities hope to have a working mobile app by August, in time for the start of the fall semester. He said policymakers could use the system to warn the public to avoid hotspots of infection.

In other instances, people who have been assigned high personal risk scores might decide to stay home or get tested for COVID-19.

But the project, whose federal grant money comes from the National Science Foundation, has already raised red flags in terms of privacy and the potential for Big Brother-style abuse.

There needs to be “a careful balance or privacy protection with public health benefits,” Bennett Cyphers, a staff technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights advocacy group, told dot.LA. “When you introduce ‘scoring’ that takes other factors into account, it complicates everything, and increases the risk that users will be misinformed or discriminated against due to factors beyond their control.”

The assigning of personal scores could also cause problems if an employer requires workers reveal them as a condition of receiving a benefit, entering a building, or returning to their office, Cyphers said.

China’s social credit system has blacklisted more than 13 million citizens as “untrustworthy,” according to a recent report from the state-run Global Times. The report did not say what these individuals did to land on the list, but the regime has revealed the system assigns a numerical score to every Chinese citizen based on how much the Communist Party approves of his or her behavior.

The system has also blocked 23 million Chinese citizens from traveling by train or plane.

Beijing announced the system in 2015 and launched it last year. The system essentially spies on citizens in virtually every aspect of daily life, both online and physically through facial recognition cameras.

Apple and Google announced this year that they are working on a separate Bluetooth application that will provide contact tracing of the coronavirus using smartphone location data.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-04,North Korea Refuses to Explain Exchange of Gunfire with South Korea,"North Korean troops fired several gunshots at a South Korean guard post inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on Sunday, prompting the South Korean soldiers to fire a volley of warning shots in response and broadcast a warning against further aggression.

The North Korean regime did not respond to South Korea’s request for an explanation of the incident.

As South Korea’s Yonhap News told the tale on Sunday, South Korean border guards heard gunfire early Sunday morning, emerged from their outpost to investigate, and found four bullet holes in the wall. They responded by firing two volleys of ten warning shots, in accordance with longstanding protocols. No injuries have been reported from the exchange of gunfire.

“We also sent a notice to the North Korean side via the inter-Korean communication line at around 9:35 a.m., and called for its explanation,” a spokesperson for the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said.

As of Monday morning, North Korea has not responded to that request for an explanation. South Korea also used the inter-Korean communication line to advise the North that the actions of its soldiers violated military accords between the two Koreas.

According to South Korean military officials quoted by Joongang Ilbo, the four rounds fired by North Korea “appeared to have a caliber of 14.5 millimeters, meaning they likely came from a Soviet-made heavy machine gun commonly used by North Korea as anti-aircraft weapons.”

Chosun Ilbo quoted a South Korean Defense Ministry official who assessed a “low probability of deliberate provocation” and suggested the shots may have been fired during a period of “low visibility” during the early morning when North Korean forces typically check their weapons. The official further noted North Korean farmers in the area tended to their chores without any disruption and there were no unusual movements by North Korean troops.

“It was the first exchange of gunfire between South and North Korea in years. Under the Comprehensive Military Agreement signed in September 2018, the two Koreas agreed to halt all hostile acts against each other, a move aimed at reducing tensions and building trust,” Yonhap noted.

The United Nations Command (UNC), which enforces the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, said on Monday that it will investigate the incident and will “continue to monitor the situation.” The UNC announced on Monday that it will send a team to the DMZ to investigate the incident.

Both the UNC and South Korean military spokespeople said the North does not appear to have taken any further aggressive action beyond firing those four gunshots into the wall of the South Korean outpost.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Martha Raddatz of ABC News on Sunday that the incident appears to have been an isolated accident.

“We can confirm at least the initial reports are that you’ve described are just about right – a handful of shots that came across from the North. We think those were accidental. The South Koreans did return fire. So far as we can tell, there was no loss of life on either side,” Pompeo told Raddatz.

Pompeo did not speculate on whether the DMZ gunfire incident was related in some way to the reappearance of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, who kept a very low profile for much of April and was rumored to have been incapacitated or killed during heart surgery. Some South Korean media outlets have suggested the shots were fired to send some sort of message in connection with Kim’s reappearance at a fertilizer plant on Friday.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/04/north-korea-refuses-explain-exchange-gunfire-south-korean-outpost/
['Frances Martel'],2020-05-04,Chinese Media: U.S. Must Listen to ‘Civilized World’ and Stop Questioning Communist Party,"The official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the People’s Daily, disparaged on Sunday the growing number of lawsuits against China for its mishandling of what became the Chinese coronavirus pandemic as a “political farce” and a “shame for human civilization.”

The People’s Daily focused on lawsuits in the United States, specifically those that legal authorities have filed in states like Missouri and Mississippi, despite the fact that multiple nations – including Nigeria, Egypt, and Italy – are entertaining similar legal action against the Chinese communist regime for failing to properly address the outbreak when it began in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in the heart of the country. The state lawsuits may soon be aided by Congressional legislation carving out an exception to China’s sovereign immunity in U.S. courts.

Chinese officials initially reacted to reports of a contagious disease spreading in Wuhan by arresting doctors sharing safety tips online. When it alerted the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to the discovery of a new virus, Beijing falsely claimed it did not spread from person to person, a claim the W.H.O. shared with the world. China also pressured countries not to impose travel restrictions on its citizens to prevent the spread of the virus, though it now claims that only “imported” cases are a threat and strictly curtails entry into the country.

One study found that China properly abiding by international public health law could have prevented as many as 95 percent of its documented coronavirus cases.

The People’s Daily nonetheless railed against legal attempts to hold the country accountable, calling them a “political farce” and an affront on longstanding principles of sovereign immunity.

Many international states, including America, adhere to the principle of sovereign immunity, banning its individual citizens from suing foreign states in court. This principle has exceptions – for example, crimes against humanity and war crimes are typically considered the jurisdiction of any court on earth – and American lawmakers have made it possible for its citizens to sue some states in extraordinary circumstances. The most recent instance of this was a law passed during the tenure of President Barack Obama, over his veto, to allow Americans to sue Saudi Arabia for damages related to the September 11, 2001, jihadist attacks.

Sovereign states can be sued in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but only by other state entities.

White House

In an article titled “U.S. Practice to Claim Compensation for COVID-19 Outbreak a Shame for Human Civilization,” using the W.H.O. name for the Chinese coronavirus, the People’s Daily accuses American officials first of somehow violating international law by noting that the virus originated in China.

“The political farce staged again and again by the U.S., a major country that touts itself as an ‘international leader,’ is astonishing people around the world,” the article asserted.

“U.S. politicians blatantly violated the rules and called the novel coronavirus ‘Chinese virus’ and ‘Wuhan virus.’ While the international society is generally lauding China’s contribution made at huge sacrifice, they are forming cliques for blackmailing,” the People’s Daily accused. “What they have done is an affront to international law and justice. The terms about sovereign immunity in the international law stipulate that the practices and treasure of a country are not bound to the legislation, jurisdiction or administration of other countries.”

“Blatantly trampling upon the sovereignty of other countries and damaging the international rule of law with supremacy, the U.S. is standing on the totally opposite side of international justice,” the column, signed under a penname that implies it is the opinion of the People’s Daily itself, read.

The article then veered into a host of conspiracy theories that have now become regular content in Chinese state media: speculation that the virus originated at a U.S. Army laboratory in Maryland, a vague attempt to tie the pandemic to the use of electronic cigarettes in the United States, and blaming the Wall Street Journal single-handedly for causing the 2008 financial crisis.

“The political manipulation by certain Americans who ignore facts and fabricate data has no moral baseline and deviates from humanity,” the article concluded, urging Americans to listen to “the civilized world” and stop questioning the Communist Party.

The article appears largely to be a response to the Missouri and Mississippi lawsuits, which contend that China must pay redress to Americans hurt physically or economically by the pandemic because the Communist Party could have prevented it from hurting them and chose not to.

“The repeated unlawful and unreasonable acts and omissions of [China] have been injurious to — and have significantly interfered with — the lives, health, and safety of substantial numbers of Missouri residents, ruining lives and damaging the public order and economy of the State of Missouri,” the lawsuit read in part.

The Global Times, another belligerent Chinese state publication, dismissed the lawsuit as “a farce” that has no chance in court because “China’s anti-virus achievements are obvious.” Yet the Communist Party’s mouthpieces have failed to stop publicly fretting about the legal actions.

Outside of America, however, other countries are considering similar action. Last week, the Nigerian law firm Azinge and Azinge announced its intention to bring to court a lawsuit against the state of China seeking $200 billion in damages as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the extensively documented acts of racism against black people in China. The Communist Party has claimed for weeks that foreigners were bringing coronavirus into Chinese communities despite the virus originating in the country, resulting in incidents of restaurants, including a local McDonald’s branch, posting notices that black people would not be allowed on the premises. Han Chinese landlords also enacted a mass eviction of black tenants in southern Guangzhou city.

In perhaps the most damning twist against China, the Communist Party itself allowed a lawsuit to move forward last month against Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak there.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-03,New York Times Op-ed: Dump Biden over Tara Reade Allegations,"The New York Times published an op-ed Sunday evening arguing that Democrats should dump former Vice President Joe Biden as their candidate because of the potential damage of Tara Reade’s allegations against him.

Reade has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in a Senate hallway in 1993; Biden denies the allegations.

In the op-ed, titled “Democrats, It’s Time to Consider a Plan B,” Elizabeth Bruenig argues:

I have my own impressions regarding Ms. Reade’s allegations, but no one — save Ms. Reade and Mr. Biden — knows with certainty whether her claims are true. What I can assert with firm conviction is that Democrats ought to start considering a backup plan for 2020. Ms. Reade’s account is not nearly as incredible as some have argued. In the course of my reporting, I have worked closely with many survivors of sexual assault. It isn’t unusual, in my experience, for survivors to exhibit behavior that seems unstable or erratic to others. They may initially disclose to investigators or journalists only a fragment of what happened, and then reveal more over time — some even falsely recant, either because they sense the police don’t believe them, or because they fear the consequences of pressing their claims. And victims often maintain relationships with their attackers or harbor mixed feelings about them. … Believing women, that oft-rehearsed exhortation, must mean taking action if it’s to mean anything. A thorough and fully transparent investigation is critical, but nothing produced by any inquiry will entirely settle the question. It is still possible — if not likely — that all of this will simply fade away, and that Mr. Biden will continue his campaign without ever submitting to a full accounting, precisely the sort of thing #MeToo was meant to prevent. But it is also possible that this won’t just go away, and that it will demoralize voters and place Mr. Biden at a disadvantage against Mr. Trump in the general election, despite the fact that Mr. Trump has a damning list of accusers alleging sexual offenses. For a candidate mainly favored for his presumed electability and the perception of empathy and decency, that’s a serious liability. To preserve the strides made on behalf of victims of sexual assault in the era of #MeToo, and to maximize their chances in November, Democrats need to begin formulating an alternative strategy for 2020 — one that does not include Mr. Biden.

Read the full op-ed here.

Democrats have thus far rallied around Biden; the Democratic National Committee has rejected a call by the Times editorial board to conduct its own independent investigation of the allegations against Biden.

['Allum Bokhari'],2020-05-05,Jair Bolsonaro’s Son Suspended from Amazon-Owned Streaming Platform Twitch,"Jair Renan Bolsonaro, the fourth-oldest son of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, was suspended from the Amazon-owned video streaming platform Twitch.tv last week after casting doubt on the severity of the Chinese virus pandemic.

According to the Brazillian Report, Renan Bolsonaro compared the coronavirus to “just a little flu,” and encouraged his viewers to go out on the streets.

The 22-year old son of the Brazilian president was broadcasting a match on the popular video game League of Legends. Twitch, which was acquired by Amazon in 2014, is the leading streaming platform for gamers.

“Go to the streets, OK? What pandemic?,” said Renan Bolsonaro. “This is a media invention to lock you inside your home, so you’ll think the world is crumbling. It’s just a little flu, brother.”

This comes after his father was censored by Twitter and Facebook for posting videos of himself speaking to Brazilian voters about the need to balance addressing the pandemic with averting a prolonged economic slump.

In a post on Twitter, the president’s son said that he had been banned “for life.” However, in a statement to Insider, Twitch said that the ban was only temporary.

Fui banido da Twitch para sempre. Interessante é que a rede social mantém perfis que disseminam claramente a misandria (ódio, o desprezo ou o preconceito contra homens ou meninos), mas não suportam uma brincadeira, por mais pesada que fosse. + pic.twitter.com/V6Bf9FHFJw — Renan Bolsonaro (@renan_bolsonaro) May 1, 2020

“In line with our policies on hateful conduct, Renan Bolsonaro has been issued a temporary ban from Twitch for comments made on stream, and the offending content has been removed,” said a Twitch spokesperson, although they did not specify what, if any, of Renan’s comments on Twitch were “hateful.”

Twitch is the latest social media platform to demonstrate that it will punish users who attempt the minimize the danger of the Chinese virus. YouTube recently banned two doctors from Bakersfield, California who suggested an earlier reopening of the country given lower-than-expected mortality rates.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-05,"Harvard Law Prof: Coronavirus Is an Excuse to Dump Free Speech, Property Rights from Constitution","Harvard Law Professor Adrian Vermeule suggests using the Chinese virus pandemic as an excuse to establish a new interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, implementing Marxist policies that do away with concepts such as “free speech ideology” and “property rights.”

Adrian Vermeule, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard Law School, recently wrote a piece for the Atlantic in which he argues that traditional interpretations of the U.S. constitution have “now outlived its utility,” and that it is now time for the government to take a more centralized role in people’s lives.

Vermeule argues that “circumstances have now changed” due to the Chinese virus pandemic, and that it is now possible to imagine “moral” constitutionalism, which he says is not “enslaved to the original meaning of the Constitution,” and is also “liberated” from the narrative of “relentless expansion of individualistic autonomy.”

The professor is advocating for a new interpretation of the U.S. constitution, which he refers to as “common-good constitutionalism.”

“Such an approach,” wrote Vermeule, “should be based on the principles that government helps direct persons, associations, and society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in the interest of attaining the common good is entirely legitimate.”

Vermeule also scrutinizes “the libertarian assumptions central to free-speech law and free-speech ideology,” which he says is “forbidden to judge the quality and moral worth of public speech,” and therefore, should “fall under the ax.”

The law professor even goes as far as stating that “property rights and economic rights will also have to go,” because they “bar the state from enforcing duties of community and solidarity in the use and distribution of resources.”

Vermeule claims that this “global pandemic” makes for the perfect opportunity to implement such strategies that grow government, insisting that “it has become clear that a just governing order must have ample power to cope with large-scale crises of public health and well-being.”

The professor also noted that when he says the government should get involved in “health,” he is referring to that “in many senses, not only literal and physical but also metaphorical and social.”

Vermeule even acknowledges that “the central aim of the constitutional order is to promote good rule, not to ‘protect liberty’ as an end in itself,” and that one common-good principle will be “that no constitutional right to refuse vaccination exists.”

“Constitutional law will define in broad terms the authority of the state to protect the public’s health and well-being, protecting the weak from pandemics and scourges of many kinds,” wrote Vermeule.

The professor even goes on to admit that implementing such principles would require overriding “selfish” claims of individuals to private rights, and that his interpretation of constitutional law means that “rulers” should be afforded a “broad scope.”

Vermeule insists that “these principles include respect for the authority of rule and of rulers,” the “respect for the legitimate roles of public bodies and associations at all levels of government and society,” and “a candid willingness to ‘legislate morality,'” among other concepts.

In January, Vermeule’s colleague, chemistry chairman Charles Lieber, was charged with fraud over his private financial relationship with the Chinese government. Lieber was paid millions of dollars by the Chinese government to work on “collaborative projects” between Harvard and the Chinese government.

This week, Republicans in the House of Representatives announced that they have launched an investigation into China’s influence on American universities and colleges.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-05,"Obamas, Lady Gaga to Headline YouTube’s Virtual 2020 Commencement Event","Former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are set to give virtual commencement speeches for the graduating class of 2020, who are forced to celebrate their graduations remotely due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

The boy band BTS and pop star Lady Gaga will also be giving commencement speeches, and there will even be guest appearances by Alicia Keys, Kelly Rowland, Kerry Washington, Chloe X Halle, Zendaya, and more, according to a report by Deadline.

The report added that the virtual commencement ceremony, entitled, Dear Class of 2020, will be a multi-hour event hosted on YouTube on June 6, and will celebrate this year’s graduating students “worldwide.”

“Graduation is a tradition that students and families look forward to and with the current state of the world, YouTube is lending some inspiration in the form of a virtual commencement,” said YouTube’s Susanne Daniels.

“We hope bringing together noteworthy, influential speakers along with performances from some of their favorite artists will provide encouragement for the students who have worked so hard to get here,” she added.

The former president and first lady are expected to deliver their own separate commencement speeches — as well as a joint message — to the graduating high school and college seniors who are forced to watch a virtual ceremony due to the deadly Wuhan coronavirus.

YouTube says that the Dear Class of 2020 is meant for people around the world to come together to celebrate their resilience, as well as the endless possibilities of their future.

“The festival-style line up combines classic commencement day themes with a diverse array of entertainment that will capture all of the emotions of graduation including pride, hope, optimism, and camaraderie,” said YouTube.

Many graduating — and current — students, however, are unsure about their futures, given that draconian measures implemented in response to the Chinese virus have resulted in upended businesses, plunging millions of Americans into unemployment and financial devastation.

An estimated 28 million Americans are canceling or changing their education plans at colleges and universities over the Wuahn virus, which has shaken up the world of academia.

Meanwhile, universities across the country are facing class-action lawsuits filed by students demanding refunds due to the alleged lack of quality in education and services they have received as a result of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

['Ben Kew'],2020-05-05,Steve Carell Reluctantly Takes Command in First Trailer of Netflix’s ‘Space Force’,"Netflix released the teaser trailer for Steve Carell’s new workplace comedy series Space Force on Tuesday, inspired by President Donald Trump’s decision to designate the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the U.S. military.

The series follows the career of the decorated pilot and four-star general Mark R. Naird (Carell), who has long dreamed of leading the United States Air Force but instead finds himself in charge of the newly formed Space Force. It is largely inspired by President Donald Trump’s move to establish the military’s sixth branch back in 2018.

“I’m hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces,” Trump said at the time. “That’s a big statement.”

In the new teaser trailer, Naird is shown struggling to adjust to his new role as one character is heard describing the operation to colonize space as a “complete shit show.” Although Trump is never mentioned by name, the characters are regularly seen laughing or scoffing at the president’s orders.

Space Force stars Lisa Kudrow as Naird’s wife Maggie, who also faces difficulties adjusting to her husband’s new role. Other cast members include John Malkovich, Ben Schwartz, Jimmy O. Yang, Noah Emmerich, Fred Willard, Tawny Newsome, Diana Silvers, Alex Sparrow, and Don Lake.

The 10-episode series, co-created by Carell and The Office showrunner Greg Daniels, is the former’s first television comedy since he departed his role as Michael Scott in the hit NBC sitcom back in 2011.

“We realized that the story had beautiful visuals and a mythic quality, and it echoed some of America’s best moments,” Space Force co-creator Greg Daniels said in a press release.

“It had a lot of heroism and yet it also had a strong satirical element. Suddenly everybody has realized that there are riches to be had on the moon, and we’ve got to stake our claim,” he continued. “It feels like there’s now a scramble to colonize space. The contrast between that and the super hopeful early days of NASA, when it was just such an achievement for all of mankind to get a person on the moon, is a good subject for satire.”

Space Force premieres on Netflix on May 29th.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-04,Nicolas Cage Cast as ‘Tiger King’ Joe Exotic,"Actor Nicolas Cage is expected to play Joe Exotic from Netflix’s hit series Tiger King in a new scripted series about the eccentric zookeeper.

Nicolas Cage is set to star in a new eight-episode scripted series centered around Tiger King‘s Joe Schreibvogel — better known as Joe Exotic — according to a report by Variety.

The report added that the series will be taken to market in the next few days, and is being produced by Imagine Television Studios and CBS Television Studios. The series will be based on an article in Texas Monthly, entitled, Joe Exotic: A Dark Journey Into the World of a Man Gone Wild.

The Tiger King television documentary was released on March 20 and quickly became a cult classic. And now, Cage is staring in what will be the first television role of his career.

The Tiger King character that Cage will star as is an eccentric, exotic zookeeper in Oklahoma who fights to keep his park, according to Variety, which added that the series will also explore how Schreibvogel became “Joe Exotic,” as well as how he lost himself to “a character of his own creation.”

The show’s writer, showrunner, and executive producer will be Dan Lagana, who was also the showrunner for the Emmy-nominated Netflix series American Vandal. Lagana has also worked on the MTV series Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous, as well as the Hulu series Deadbeat.

Paul Young will also serve as executive producer through Make Good Content.

The new show staring Cage is the second scripted series about the strange world of Tiger King, according to Variety. The first spin-off series was announced late last year, and will reportedly star Kate McKinnon as Carole Baskin.

['Lucas Nolan'],2020-05-04,Report: Used Tesla Parts Found for Sale with Previous Owners’ Personal Info Still Loaded,"According to a recent report, Tesla components containing the previous owners’ personal information are appearing for sale online.

A recent report from InsideEVs claimed that Tesla’s retrofitting service for media control units and Autopilot hardware may be failing to properly protect owners’ personal data. A white hat hacker (a term used to describe ethical hackers) named GreenTheOnly obtained four Tesla computers off eBay and found the previous owner’s personal data still on all of them.

Green alleges that he informed Tesla of this before bringing his findings to InsideEVs, but according to Green, Tesla refused to notify all of its customers that could be affected in a timely manner. Tesla has reportedly stated that it will be notifying one of its affected customers but has yet to do so.

According to Green, each of the modules he bought had “owner’s home and work location, all saved wifi passwords, calendar entries from the phone, call lists and address books from paired phones, Netflix and other stored session cookies.” The stored session cookies could give hackers access to private accounts.

It seems that when Tesla owners had their vehicles retrofitted with new computer hardware, the old components containing personal data may currently be for sale on eBay. The first generation MCU computers, MCUv1, had issues with excessive logging which caused the computer to fail within four to five years.

The MCUv2 allegedly fixed this issue and was made available in the United States on March 3. Green alleges that MCUv2 units are also failing due to manufacturing issues with the EMMC chip, but all of the computers are involved in the current privacy issue are the original MCU units.

For Tesla’s Model 3 vehicle, the ICE computer on older cars often needs to upgraded if the owner purchases Tesla’s Full Self Driving (FSD) package. Green obtained three ICE computers from Tesla Model 3 cars and one MCUv2 from a Model X vehicle, he outlined the process stating:

“Prices on eBay for these units started to drop from more than $500 to $300 then $200 then $150 and so on, so more and more people started to buy them for research. They are useless in car repairs because there’s no easy way to use them in other cars. Since you need specialized knowledge to get started, some of those people turned to me and other ‘hackers’ to help them get started. Some units were sent to me to extract data out of them to bootstrap some research too. This is when I became aware of the data leakage happening. I then purchased a unit on eBay to confirm it works exactly like that. And it sure does.”

InsideEVs contacted Tesla in an attempt to determine how the company ensures that customer data is protected when removing ICE computers from vehicles. Tesla did not comment, but one source stated that technicians were told to throw the replaced computers away or damage them before trashing them.

Green commented: “I also heard a prerequisite to throwing the unit into a dumpster is to hit it with a hammer a few times. This obviously does not destroy any data and I did see these units for sale too – at even lower prices, at times as little as $10 if you get a box full of them. Obviously, undamaged units sell for more, so I guess there’s an incentive to not hit them with any hammers.”

['Allum Bokhari'],2020-05-04,"Amazon VP Resigns in Protest over Treatment of Workers, Whistleblowers","Tim Bray, a vice president at Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce giant Amazon, has resigned in protest of the company’s treatment of workers who have criticized the company over inadequate protections against the Chinese virus.

In a blog post, Bray aired his dismay at the tech company’s treatment of employees who spoke out against the company’s handling of the coronavirus.

From Bray’s blog:

Stories surfaced of unrest in Amazon warehouses, workers raising alarms about being uninformed, unprotected, and frightened. Official statements claimed every possible safety precaution was being taken. Then a worker organizing for better safety conditions was fired, and brutally insensitive remarks appeared in leaked executive meeting notes where the focus was on defending Amazon “talking points”. Warehouse workers reached out to AECJ for support. They responded by internally promoting a petition and organizing a video call for Thursday April 16 featuring warehouse workers from around the world, with guest activist Naomi Klein. An announcement sent to internal mailing lists on Friday April 10th was apparently the flashpoint. Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, two visible AECJ leaders, were fired on the spot that day. The justifications were laughable; it was clear to any reasonable observer that they were turfed for whistleblowing. Management could have objected to the event, or demanded that outsiders be excluded, or that leadership be represented, or any number of other things; there was plenty of time. Instead, they just fired the activists. At that point I snapped.

Amazon is currently facing multiple inquiries from labor regulators over allegations that it unlawfully retaliated against employees who complained about the company’s failure to protect them from the virus.

One of the fired Amazon employees, Chris Smalls, spoke exclusively with Breitbart News last week, on a segment of SirusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with Rebecca Mansour.

“At the beginning of March, we were unprotected,” Smalls told Mansour. “We didn’t have any facial masks, we didn’t have any cleaning supplies. We didn’t have the right type of gloves that protect our skin. My associates, my employees that I supervised were falling ill in a domino effect, one by one [with] flu-like symptoms. Some of them were even vomiting at their stations.”

After airing his concerns, Smalls was fired before the end of March.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-04,"Georgia Tech, Boston U. Investigate Cheating During Online Exams","Boston University and Georgia Tech are currently investigating suspected cheating by students in online final exams. The exams, which were recently administrated online, have sparked a conversation in academic about cheating on online exams.

According to a report by the New York Post, administrators at Boston University and Georgia Tech are currently conducting investigations into suspected cheating on recent final exams. As a result of the ongoing Chinese virus pandemic, most final exams are being administered online.

Students in physics and chemistry courses at Boston University may have used an online service called Chegg to look up answers during their final exam. Boston University spokesman Colin Riley said that offending students should have been familiar with how university policies would apply to online examinations.

“The conduct code clearly spells out the university’s expectations and policies, and all aspects of it remain in effect with the shift to remote learning,” Riley said. “The investigation into this particular issue is active and underway.”

Boston University said it is currently conducting an investigation with Chegg to see which students accessed the service during their exam administration. Chegg is an online service where students post answers to various questions that are found in textbooks and test banks. Students typically use the service to aid in their understanding of homework assignments.

A Georgia Tech spokesperson said that they are encouraging students to come forward if they cheated during a recent exam.

“We are aware of the situation and are, of course, disappointed that students were involved with cheating through a digital homework site. At this point, we have offered students a chance to come forward admitting their misconduct on this exam, and we are working to determine if others are involved,” a Georgia Tech spokeswoman said in a comment.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-04,U. of Kentucky Plans to Reopen for Fall Semester,"The University of Kentucky announced on Friday that it plans to reopen the campus for the upcoming fall semester. University President Eli Capilouto said that he and his staff are working to “reinvent” a new “normal” that allows students to safely return to campus in the fall.

According to a local news report, the University of Kentucky is planning to reopen its campus for the fall semester. However, university officials claim that a variety of precautions will be taken to mitigate the spread of the Chinese virus.

“In an uncertain world, we must think about new challenges that we’ve never before confronted,” UK President Eli Capilouto wrote in an email to the university community on Friday. “And, we do so as the world seems to shift daily under our feet. You’ve handled every stress and strain with the grace and grit that defines this place.”

According to the email, the University of Kentucky will deploy various precautionary measures to prevent the virus from spreading on campus. For example, some courses may continue to be taught online. Other courses, particularly those that benefit from in-person instruction, will resume on campus.

Capilouto said that his campus reopening plan is structured around three questions. Each question addresses various roadblocks to a successful reopening in the fall.

“What if we have to delay the start of the semester? What does that look like, and how do we shift those dates?”

“What would a hybrid approach look like, in which we are online for part of the semester and in class for another part, if there is a re-emergence of the virus?”

“What if events make a fully online approach to instruction necessary again? How would that transition take place, and what do we do with a campus that is about to begin operations or is already open?”

Brown University President Christina Paxson laid out her proposal to reopen campuses in a New York Times column that was published last week. “Our students will have to understand that until a vaccine is developed, campus life will be different,” Paxson wrote. Paxson suggested that Brown will invite students to return to campus for the fall semester.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/05/04/u-of-kentucky-plans-to-reopen-for-fall-semester/

In a New York Times op-ed titled “The Power of Big Tech Just Keeps Growing,” tech journalist and Recode founder Kara Swisher questions what kind of power Big Tech will have after the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic ends.

Swisher writes in her column: “How about this: The tech giants could have all the power and absolutely none of the accountability — at least all the power that will truly matter.”

Swisher goes on to add that in a previous column she outlined a “problematic trend” that would develop after the pandemic began, writing:

“There will be a culling of most competitors of these giants that will only strengthen the power and reach of the behemoths, eliminating pesky roadblocks to their further domination,” I wrote about tech’s leading companies, who have the money and the means to wait out the storm. “This is obviously not a good thing in the long run. But even if it is good that companies like Amazon and Google and Facebook and Apple have become an essential part of making it easier to shelter in place or to track the virus — thanks a bunch for food delivery, contact-tracing apps and lots of funny memes — there’s much that’s not good. It’s not good that we have set up an epic system of have and have-nots that could become devastating for innovative ideas and start-ups trying to get off the ground. Not good because too much of our data is in the hands of fewer. Not good because these fewer are largely unaccountable to those they serve and hard to control by governments that are elected by the people.

Swisher further adds that following the pandemic, the Masters of the Universe will be even more free to act as they wish with even less government oversight, writing:

But when this crisis is over, I can say that we most certainly should fear Big Tech more because these companies will be freer than ever, with many fewer strictures on them from regulators and politicians. The effort to rein in tech companies had been building decent momentum before coronavirus outbreak, but it will be harder when focus needs to be on building up rather than breaking apart.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-04,Lawsuit: U. of Minnesota Provides Resources Only for Leftist Activists,"Two students at the University of Minnesota are suing their university over its relationship with nine prominent leftist student groups. The students allege in their lawsuit that the university exclusively provides on-campus meeting space for student organizations that engage in progressive activism.

According to a report by the Star Tribune, students Evan Smith and Isaac Smith of the University of Minnesota are suing their school over its alleged preferential treatment towards leftist student groups.

The students claim that the university exclusively provides certain resources to nine student groups that engage in progressive activism. The groups mentioned in the lawsuit are the Black Student Union, La Raza Student Cultural Center, Disabled Student Cultural Center, Feminist Student Activist Collective, Queer Student Cultural Center, Asian-American Student Union, Minnesota International Student Association, American Indian Student Cultural Center, and the Al-Madinah Cultural Center.

The nine groups were granted office space inside the Coffman Memorial Union building on the University of Minnesota’s Twin Cities campus. According to the lawsuit, no other student group is permitted to request similar accommodations. The lawsuit estimates that the lease value of the office space is $30,000 per year.

The lawsuit also questions the constitutionality of a policy that blocks partisan groups from accessing funds that are designated for student organizations. Moreover, the student newspaper and radio station received nearly $1 million in university funding in 2019. However, regular student organizations can only receive up to $55,000 per year.

Attorney Erick Kaardal, who represents the students, argued that the designation of the Coffman Memorial Union building as a meeting space for leftist student groups highlights the university’s bias.

“The University of Minnesota has created a student-services-fee-funded shrine on the second floor of Coffman Memorial Union to worship the great god of political correctness,” Kaardal said. “In order to do so, the university trashes the First Amendment. The public expects the university to take care of and educate its students, not to abuse their student services fees.”

The “Defeat Disinfo” group is being advised by retired Army General Stanley McChrystal.

The project is called “Defeat Disinfo,” a creation of entrepreneur Curtis Hougland. It was initially funded by the Pentagon’s top-secret DARPA research agency, when the goal of the technology was to identify and counter online narratives from Islamic extremists. Founded by technology entrepreneur Curtis Hougland, it is still advised by retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who led U.S. forces in Afghanistan until 2010.

Now Democrats are using the state-funded technology to defeat Trump.

As initially reported by the Washington Post:

A new Democratic-aligned political action committee advised by retired Army Gen.

Police officers, like nurses and other emergency and health workers, have taken to uploading videos of themselves capering around to the youth-oriented social media platforming as the Chinese coronavirus crisis unfolds — but force leaders are concerned such antics detract from the public’s sense that they are serving performing serious and vital functions.

“From a National Police Chiefs Council point of view, we’ve been very clear, particularly through Covid, that we’re not encouraging people to take part in dancing, rapping TikTok challenges,” said Chief Constable Gavin Stephen, the Council’s “national lead for digital engagement”, in comments to the Mail on Sunday.

Chief Constable Andy Cooke of Merseyside Police, which serves a swathe of north-west England including Liverpool, went further, warning that his force had “reminded officers and staff that such behaviour is wholly unprofessional and will not be tolerated… Merseyside Police holds clear policies about behaviour, including the inappropriate use of social media, and anything which breaches these would be subject to potential disciplinary proceedings.”

Chief Constable Cooke added that “Above all else” the role of law enforcement during the Chinese virus crisis is “to support the NHS and keep policing our communities, many of whom would be rightly appalled to see police officers failing to show respect for the uniform they wear.”

Cressida Dick, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police serving much of London, for example, was condemned even by Labour mayor Sadiq Khan for a recent stunt in which she and a large number of other police officers and other piled onto Westminster Bridge, without masks or gloves and without following social distancing rules, in order to perform a mass “Clap for Carers”.

Other senior officers have been criticised for allegedly exceeding their powers by trying to tell shoppers they were not allowed to purchase “non-essential” items — including Easter Eggs — and threatening that officers may begin inspecting their shopping baskets and bags to ensure compliance.

['Penny Starr'],2020-05-03,Tara Reade Facing Online Bullying for Accusing Biden of Sexual Assault,"Tara Reade, the former Senate aide to former Vice President Joe Biden who alleges that the presumptive 2020 Democrat president nominee sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, is facing a barrage of online harassment, according to a Fox News interview with Reade on Saturday.

“I find it astounding — the hypocrisy that Democrats are talking about women being able to tell their story safely,” Reade said. “I’m a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, but yet here I am trying to talk about my history with Joe Biden and I’m just the target of online harassment.”

Fox News reported on the harassment, including fake social media accounts in Reade’s name:

Reade told Fox News that the home address of a family member was plastered online and that person received four “creepy” calls on Friday night, all within 30 minutes, from an unknown number. In two voice messages obtained by Fox News, a caller appeared to have posed as a journalist seeking to speak with Reade. “Hi Ms. Reade, this is Dave Johnson from the Observer, a small New York newspaper,” the voice says before laughing uncontrollably, later saying “Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself” and “Trump 2020.” In the second voice message, which was the third attempt at calling Reade’s family member, the caller says: “Hey Tara, this is Dave Johnson with the Observer and I would really love, I’d really appreciate a call back so we can discuss your new powerful allegation against Vice President Biden. I think you’re setting a tone and underscoring a double standard put forth by the Me Too movement, so I’d really appreciate it if you could just call me back, give me a couple of quick questions.”

Fox News also obtained an email sent to Reade from someone using the name Linda Dubois who called Reade a “f—king whore” and a “disgrace to womanhood” for speaking out against Biden.

“You are a rip-roaring b—h and the great majority of Americans don’t believe you anyhow… I hope you drop dead,” the email said.

Fox News reported that Jon Cooper, a former chair of the Democratic Coalition, questioned if Reade was “unbalanced” or “was driven by malicious motives” on Twitter.

I don’t know if Tara Reade is unbalanced or was driven by malicious motives, but it’s clear that this story is OVER. Now let’s get back to the REAL issues, like Trump’s incompetence that has led to the deaths of nearly 70,000 Americans, with 30 million filing for unemployment. — Jon Cooper 🇺🇸 (@joncoopertweets) May 2, 2020

“This is an example [of] what I am dealing with in addition to the threats and harassment online,” Reade tweeted about Cooper.

“This is something that really has to stop and I’m just wondering where this is coming from,” Reade told Fox News. “Are these just fanatic supporters? And if so, what does that say about our Democratic voters? Why are they targeting me when the party line is supposed to be allowing people to be safe? Why are they targeting my family and myself and making my family frightened?”

“It creates barriers for survivors to want to come forward and talk about difficult things that have happened,” Reade said. “And in my case, talking about how Joe Biden sexually harassed and sexually assaulted me is very excruciating and enough by itself, but then to be targeted and harassed and have my whole family targeted and harassed online by people that call themselves his supporters is not only just upsetting, it’s frightening.”

On Friday, Biden said in an interview with MSNBC that the assault “never happened,” and while women should be heard if they claim they’ve been sexually assaulted they should also be “vetted.”

['James P. Pinkerton'],2020-05-03,"Pinkerton: It’s Time to Build, and Maybe Even Silicon Valley Now Agrees","Cyberspace Is Less Important than “Meatspace”

The coronavirus has reminded all of us—even the tech titans of Silicon Valley—that the digital and the virtual ultimately matter less than the physical and the biological. That is, it’s fun to be online, but what’s more important is to be alive.

Yes, surfing the Internet, sending texts, and streaming movies is of value to ordinary people—even if, of course, vastly greater value is reaped by those who own, say, Google, or Netflix, or AT&T. And yet today, all of us, toilers and tycoons alike, are being reminded that personal health means more than being well wired. Yes, Internet viruses are a pain, but the coronavirus is worse, because a malfunctioning computer isn’t as bad as a malfunctioning human body.

In other words, we’re reminded that for all the importance of cyberspace, our personal space—which techies sometimes call “meatspace”—is of much greater importance.

With that in mind, here in meatspace—also known as reality—we humans have to think about our ourselves, our families, and our fellow citizens. And as corporeal beings, we have to think also about our homes, roads, and jobs.

Indeed, we should think, in particular, about factories—because if the Chinese, for example, wish to infect us with some dangerous pathogen, we need a domestic medical-industrial complex for our own defense. (And of course, if the Chinese were ever to wish to nuke us or conquer us, we need other kinds of hardware, constantly upgraded, for our national security.)

How Silicon Valley Changed

Santa Clara Valley became Silicon Valley in the decades immediately after World War Two. In fact, as early as 1939, pioneering tech entrepreneurs William Hewlett and David Packard started building electronic instruments in their garage; nearby Moffett Naval Air Station became a hub for both purchases and innovation, soon spreading across the entire Department of Defense.

We can step back and observe that this early iteration of Silicon Valley was closely linked to practical applications; that is, the Valley was focused on gadgets and machines that helped us fight our wars.

Yet since the end of the Cold War, Silicon Valley has changed; it has shifted to a new and far more profitable focus, namely, slaking consumer demand. As we all know, Big Tech has focused on the virtual—that is, on new and better ways to search, to send e-mails and texts, to post things online, and to crunch data. To be sure, there’s nothing wrong with finding new ways to communicate, even if, of course, we haven’t adequately forestalled the disruption of other industries, including, but hardly limited to, media and publishing.

Indeed, Silicon Valley, as an ever-charging engine of virtuality, has seemed to be unstoppable. Thus prominent tech venture capitalist Marc Andreessen was inspired to write in 2011, “Software is eating the world.” We can recall that Andreessen first burst into prominence by developing the Mosaic browser for Netscape in the early 1990s; since then, he has invested in such virtual-product companies as Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Twitter, Zynga, and LinkedIn.

As Andreessen put it a decade ago, cheering on his business:

More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services—from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not.

It’s interesting to recall that one of few voices running counter to Andreessen was that of another tech mogul, Peter Thiel, who declared in 2011, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” (Thiel was referring, of course, to the limits imposed by Twitter on the number of characters in a tweet; the limit has since been increased to 280.)

Thiel’s deeper point was that if Andreessen’s software-centric view prevailed, then progress in the world of hardware would likely continue to falter—and that’s why we can send tweets but not go flying around in Jetsons-type vehicles.

Indeed, an over-emphasis on the digital realm has come at the expense of the physical environment—which techies often call the analog world. After all, if you can work from home, then why worry about physical infrastructure, such as roads and bridges? And if you could freely surf the World Wide Web from your couch, why worry about national borders and a country’s sovereignty? And if you don’t worry about borders and countries, then why worry about your countrymen?

In the advanced tech lingo of the digital elite, geographic demarcations are simply “errors,” to be worked around by clever programmers and hackers—and the nation state is therefore said to be obsolete.

The Paradox of Slow Growth in the Digital Era

This idea of rampant digitalization has had consequences, to be sure—severe consequences. An important article appearing in The Atlantic in January was headlined, “The Real Trouble With Silicon Valley: The toxicity of the web is peanuts compared with Big Tech’s failure to remake the physical world.” As author Derek Thompson put it:

The digital age has coincided with a slump in America’s economic dynamism. The tech sector’s innovations have made a handful of people quite rich, but it has failed to create enough middle-class jobs to offset the decline of the country’s manufacturing base, or to help solve the country’s most pressing problems.

Continuing in that vein, Thompson added:

Decades from now, historians will likely look back on the beginning of the 21st century as a period when the smartest minds in the world’s richest country sank their talent, time, and capital into a narrow band of human endeavor—digital technology. Their efforts have given us frictionless access to media, information, consumer goods, and chauffeurs. But software has hardly remade the physical world. We were promised an industrial revolution. What we got was a revolution in consumer convenience.

That is, we have a lot of gig companies, such as Uber, Instacart, and Doordash, which is nice—even if, paradoxically, they rely mostly on old-fashioned people. And sadly, in the new order created by Silicon Valley, the algorithms have not enriched many workers, but have, rather, impoverished them. The machines, having broken down old industries, now assign displaced workers to drudge tasks, paying them only paltry sums—as insecure contractors, not as secure employees.

Not surprisingly, this bifurcating society—plutocrats and peons—is not a strong society, because what’s missing is a robust middle class that anchors institutions in comfortable stability.

Nor, interestingly enough, does this bifurcation lead to a strong economy, because the gains from productivity growth are mostly captured by the one percent of entrepreneurs and investors. Such top-heaviness, of course, leads to over-financialization and under-consumption.

In fact, Thompson points out that economic growth in the digital era has actually been slower—80 percent slower—than it was in the pre-digital era. He cites Chad Syverson, an economist at the University of Chicago, who has found that the slowdown in the economy, just since 2004, has cost the U.S. $2.7 trillion.

No wonder Peter Thiel, that tech renegade who has always cared about the physical United States, and its citizens, endorsed Donald Trump in 2016.

In the meantime, today we find that our “American” defense contractors are dependent on Mexico for key parts of their supply chains. In the tech-idealized borderless world, this is fine. In the real world, it’s not fine.

As George Mason University economist Alex Tabarrok wrote on April 26, this decline in our domestic productive capacity is “killing us.” As he put it, “The failure to spend on actually fighting the virus with science is mind boggling.”

It is, Tabarrok continued, “A rot … a failure of imagination and boldness which is an embarrassment to the country that put a man on the moon.” He noted, for example, that the share of the federal budget going to research and development has fallen from 12 percent in the 1960s to three percent today. “We are great at spending on welfare and warfare,” he concluded, “but all that spending has crowded out spending on innovation and now that is killing us.”

Let’s pray that it’s not too late to save ourselves, and our country. And then let’s get to work.

A Convert in Silicon Valley

This year, almost a decade after he celebrated the triumph of software, Silicon Valley’s Andreessen has chosen to celebrate hardware, actual construction, and an overall commitment to remaking our physical environment. Perhaps the onslaught of the virus has convinced Andreessen that more tweets won’t save us. In an April 18 essay, “It’s Time to Build,” he argued:

Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it’s not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it.

Andreessen further attacked “smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build,” adding, “You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life.” Warming to his theme, he continued:

You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know—and we’re experiencing right now!—the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods.

Andreessen added, where are the “giant, gleaming, state-of-the-art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost—all throughout our country?”

He had still more questions: “Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars?” That reference to “flying cars,” of course, was a backhanded admission that Peter Thiel had the right idea a decade ago, because, yes, flying cars—and the technology that goes into them— are more important than tweets.

It’s certainly heartening to have Andreessen on the side of human beings and their needs; now we’ll have to wait and see how he, and his fellow tech titans, choose to follow up. Indeed, we might even hope that the digital transformation of the last few decades has just been a warm-up for the coming physical transformation over the next few decades.

In fact, there are some promising indicators, suggesting that progress in the digital space will translate into progress in the medical space. For instance, an intriguing article appeared in the Wall Street Journal on April 27, headlined, “The Secret Group of Scientists and Billionaires Pushing a Manhattan Project for Covid-19.” (We can recall, of course, that during World War Two, the Manhattan Project developed the atomic bomb; it’s hard to think of anything more physical than that.) This new group hopes, for example, to transform the Food and Drug Administration, so that it can move with Moore’s Law speed.

In fact, World War Two saw a Pentagon-sponsored surge in many technologies beyond nuclear, providing our fighting men with radar, penicillin, synthetic rubber, and even new kinds of fabrics, designed to be used for everything from uniforms to parachutes. Indeed, it’s fair to say that the Good War was won as much on the homefront—in our laboratories and factories—as it was on the battlefront.

And of course, after the war, these technologies were spun off into the civilian sector. Thus we can see the origins of the big economic boom of the three decades after the war—you know, the boom that’s ebbed in recent decades.

Amidst the Current Carnage, Signs of Real Hope and Change

As our great wartime president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, said famously at the beginning of his time in the White House, “The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself.”

So now today, as we confront the reality that we’re in another war—a war against the virus—we should take heart in the fact that we have plenty of resolve and resources. And if we do take heart, we can overcome fear.

Indeed, if we buckle down and apply what we know—and figure out what we must learn—we can win this war and come back even stronger. We can, in fact, Make America Great Again. Much of that greatness, of course, will come from our own ingenuity and knowhow; indeed, it might have nothing to do, at least at first, with Silicon Valley, and everything to do with the Heartland.

For instance, just on April 30 came a report from Marcellus Drilling News, a publication devoted to the shale-gas industry in the Northeast, taking note of an astonishing new breakthrough in carbon-based fuels.

Researchers at Penn State University’s EMS Energy Institute, joined by H Quest, a Pittsburgh-based start-up, have found a way to “burn” natural gas, generating usable hydrogen while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions to zero. As the article explains, this joint partnership:

… may hold the answer to reducing so-called greenhouse gas emissions while also paving the way to disrupt the chemical and material industries. The collaboration has resulted in several research projects that aim to “reinvent” both coal and natural gas as clean, cost-effective sources of fuels and high-performance materials. … Penn State and a company called H Quest are extracting hydrogen from nat gas using microwave plasma technology. It’s completely free of so-called greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, microwave plasma enables smaller, modular chemical conversion plants-cheaper to build and deploy.

The prospect here is epic: We can preserve our carbon-based fuel industry, as well as the many millions of jobs it creates and supports, and still have an environment that might put a smile on the face of that pouting teen, Greta Thunberg. (Okay, probably not—some greens dislike everything.)

In fact, if this new technique can cleanly distill hydrogen not only from natural gas, but also from oil and coal, then we could have all the domestic energy we need for hundreds, even thousands, of years. And that would surely be the beginning of a long-term economic boom for places that need, and deserve, better times.

So maybe here is a project in which Marc Andreessen can invest, bringing the significant value-add of the latest digital tech to this new energy tech.

If so, that’s how we get the money to start building up the country again. And that’s how we start reuniting our people, aligning the red of carbon country with the blue of silicon country.

Together. That’s how we go about saving our nation—in this time of grave peril.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/05/03/pinkerton-its-time-to-build-and-maybe-even-silicon-valley-now-agrees/
['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-03,Harvard Donating Epstein Cash to Sex Crime Victim Groups,"Harvard University announced on Friday that it has donated the remaining funds that Jeffrey Epstein gifted to the university to charities that aid sex crime victims. Harvard has been criticized for its extensive relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex criminal, who reportedly visited the campus more than 40 times following his release from jail in 2010.

According to a report by CNBC, Harvard University is finally making efforts to distance itself from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who mysteriously died in a Manhattan prison last fall. The university released a 27-page report on Friday detailing the university’s extensive relationship with Epstein.

The university will donate approximately $200,000, the remaining funds from Epstein’s donations, to various groups that help victims of sex crimes. “These organizations support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault, and Harvard is proud to support their important and valuable work,” Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow wrote in a statement.

Epstein donated $9.1 million to the university between 1998 and 2008. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of procuring an underage girl for prostitution. Following the conviction, Harvard blocked Epstein from making further donations to the university. However, Harvard professors continued to solicit private donations from Epstein when he was released from jail in 2010. Moreover, the report claims that some professors lobbied the university to resume their acceptance of donations from Epstein in 2013.

The Harvard report notes that several professors admitted to visiting Epstein at his various homes, including on his infamous island. Some even admitted to visiting him while he was in prison.

“A number of the Harvard faculty members we interviewed also acknowledged that they visited Epstein at his homes in New York, Florida, New Mexico or the Virgin Islands, visited him in jail or on work release, or traveled on one of his planes,” the report reads.

Breitbart News reported on Saturday that Epstein maintained a private office on Harvard campus which he received after making a $6.5 million donation in 2003. Epstein reportedly visited Harvard’s campus more than 40 times after being released from prison in 2010.

Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre is said to be working flat out to fend off the attacks, which they have condemned as “utterly reprehensible”.

“We have seen an increased proportion of cyber attacks related to coronavirus and our experts work around-the-clock to help organisations targeted,” the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) subsidiary confirmed in a statement quoted in the Mail on Sunday.

“It looks like they’re trying to steal or borrow information about our response to coronavirus,” a source told the newspaper.

“This problem – intellectual property theft and a blurred line between state and serious crime – has been around for a while but there’s obviously now an increased need to ensure we protect UK PLC and its assets,” another source added.

The Mail cited the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation as countries the cyber-attacks had been traced to — but, curiously, made no mention of China, whose communist regime has a particular interest in the pandemic and a reputation for aggressive theft of private information and intellectual property.

Tobias Ellwood MP, a former Defence minister and current chairman of the Defence Committee of the House of Commons, has struck a similarly combative tone, warning that the “global distraction of Covid-19 provides the perfect fog of war to conduct cyber attacks” — and that Britain should “not hesitate in retaliating”.

['Joel B. Pollak'],2020-05-02,Turley: Democrats Want China’s Restrictions on Free Speech,"Jonathan Turley, a liberal constitutional scholar at George Washington University, wrote Saturday that some Democrats were using the coronavirus pandemic to demand China-style restrictions on free speech.

In the op-ed, published in The Hill, Turley criticized “the politicians and academics who have called for the censorship of social media and the internet,” including Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Hillary Clinton, and others:

The only thing spreading faster than the coronavirus has been censorship and the loud calls for greater restrictions on free speech. The Atlantic published an article last week by Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith and University of Arizona law professor Andrew Keane Woods calling for Chinese style censorship of the internet. They declared that “in the great debate of the past two decades about freedom versus control of the network, China was largely right and the United States was largely wrong” and “significant monitoring and speech control are inevitable components of a mature and flourishing internet, and governments must play a large role in these practices to ensure that the internet is compatible with society norms and values.” The justification for that is the danger of “fake news” about coronavirus risks and cures. Yet this is only the latest rationalization for rolling back free speech rights. For years, Democratic leaders in Congress called for censorship of “fake news” on social media sites. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have all engaged in increasing levels of censorship and have a well known reputation for targeting conservative speech. … Citizens now will have to decide, as Goldsmith and Woods insist, if “China was right.” For my part, I remain hopeless in my desire for old fashioned free speech before the pandemic. You see, this “new normal” seems a lot like the old normal that the Framers changed with the First Amendment. China may be right for many in Congress and academia, but it remains on the wrong side of history. Not even a pandemic will change that.

Turley, who does not support President Donald Trump, nevertheless testified in Trump’s defense before the House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment inquiry, warning Congress it was abusing its power.

['Alana Mastrangelo'],2020-05-02,Twitter Suspends Candace Owens for Telling Michigan to ‘Go to Work’,"Conservative firebrand and BLEXIT founder Candace Owens was suspended from Twitter on Saturday after tweeting that people in Michigan should open their businesses and “go to work” despite the draconian measures implemented by Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) in response to the Chinese virus.

“Apparently [Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer] believes she is a duly elected dictator of a socialist country,” Owens had tweeted. “The people of Michigan need to stand up to her. Open your businesses. Go to work.”

“The police think she’s crazy too,” she added. “They are not going to arrest 10,000,000 people for going to work.”

On Saturday, Owens received a notification from Twitter informing her that her account was suspended over the aforementioned tweet.

“We determined this Tweet violated the Twitter Rules, specifically for:” read the notification, but did not further clarify which specific rules Owens had violated on the social media platform.

Lockdown measures established roughly one month ago in response to the Wuhan coronavirus have already upended businesses across the country, and have plunged millions of Americans into unemployment and financial devastation.

Owens told Breitbart News that her options were to either go through a series of admitting that her tweet was in violation of the platform’s Terms of Service [TOS], or appeal her suspension. Owens has chosen to appeal the suspension.

“I refuse to admit to a violation, because none were committed,” Owens told Breitbart News. “Hence the reason they did not list a rule that was violated.”

“I unequivocally stand by every single word of my tweet,” Owens continued. “If Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez can use Twitter’s platform to encourage workers to walk out and boycott — I should be allowed to encourage lawful citizens to resume work.”

“The only person breaking any laws is Governor turned Dictator Gretchen Whitmer who is impoverishing millions, ignoring the votes of her state legislature, and as a result, rolling over the constitutionally protected rights of Michigan citizens,” she added.

“Twitter was unable or unwilling to provide me with any specific rule that I violated, which is why I have appealed their decision,” said Owens. “While I am not an expert on twitter TOS, I cannot see how suggesting people ought to work would be a violation of anything other than socialist reverie.”

Twitter did not immediately respond to Breitbart News’ request for comment.

['Tom Ciccotta'],2020-05-02,Report: Harvard Gave Jeffrey Epstein His Own Office on Campus,"A new report published this week details the extensive ties between Harvard University and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who mysteriously died in a Manhattan prison last fall. Harvard reportedly gave Epstein his own office on campus in exchange for almost $10 million in donations he gifted to the university between 1998 and 2007.

According to a report by the Boston Globe, Harvard University gave Jeffrey Epstein an office on campus that he continued to visit after he was convicted of underage sex crimes in 2008. In fact, Epstein reportedly visited the campus more than 40 times after been released from jail in 2010. The office was reportedly equipped with Epstein’s personal keepsakes and a dedicated Harvard phone line.

Breitbart News reported in September 2019 that Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow said that the Ivy League institution feels “regret” accepting nearly $10 million in gifts from Jeffrey Epstein. The university blocked Epstein from donating in 2008 when Epstein was convicted on child sex charges.

However, individual professors at Harvard continued to solicit private donations from Epstein after 2008. Martin Nowak, Director of Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, used a $6.5 million donation from Epstein in 2003 to establish the program. Nowak reportedly rewarded Epstein with private office space on campus for his donation.

The controversy surrounding Epstein forced Bacow to address these private gifts in a letter to the Harvard community. “The report issued today describes principled decision-making but also reveals institutional and individual shortcomings that must be addressed — not only for the sake of the University but also in recognition of the courageous individuals who sought to bring Epstein to justice,” Bacow wrote.

Harvard announced on Friday that Nowak has been placed on paid administrative leave for a potential violation of the university’s grant funding policies.

Claudine Gay, Harvard’s dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, argued that faculty at elite universities should be held to a high moral standard. “We are reminded on a near daily basis what a privilege it is to be a member of this academic community,” Gay wrote. “With that privilege comes a responsibility to hold one another accountable and to make sure, as an institution, we align our practices with the highest ethical standards.”

Breitbart News reported in September 2019 that the Director of MIT’s Media Lab was forced to step down over his ties to Epstein. The decision came after the New Yorker published a report revealing Epstein’s extensive financial ties to the MIT program.

['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-05-04,Sharansky to Use Israel's Genesis Prize Proceeds to Fight Coronavirus,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, winner of the 2020 Genesis Prize, announced Monday that he will donate the $1 million award to organizations fighting the coronavirus pandemic and assisting people most affected by the outbreak.

In a statement released by prize organizers, Sharansky said he would support organizations in Israel and abroad, some delivering immediate relief to victims and others pursuing longer-term research against the disease. In forgoing the prize money, he follows a tradition set by previous winners.

“Many people of good will around the world have given generously to help organizations and individuals who have been devastated by COVID-19. I am grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to this humanitarian effort,” Sharansky said.

The Genesis Prize Foundation said donations would go to organizations providing emergency services to Jerusalem residents of all faiths, and assisting severely disabled children, domestic violence victims, African migrants in Tel Aviv and people in need of mental health services.

He will also support research at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science, Columbia University and New York University, and help elderly Jewish communities overseas.

The $1 million award is granted each year to a person recognized for outstanding professional achievement, contribution to humanity and commitment to Jewish values.

Sharansky rose to prominence in the 1970s as a dissident in the Soviet Union, where he worked closely with the human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andre Sakharov. He was a founding member of the Helsinki Group, which monitored rights abuses by the Soviets, and became one of the best-known “refuseniks,” Soviet Jews who were denied permission to emigrate to Israel.

In 1977, Sharansky was imprisoned on fabricated charges of spying for the United States. He spent nine years in prison, serving much of that time in solitary confinement.

Sharansky was freed in a prisoner swap in 1986 after an intense international campaign led by his wife, Avital, and immediately moved to Israel.

The following year, he led a demonstration in Washington where, on the eve of a visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, some 250,000 Jews called for an end to persecution of Soviet Jews and for the freedom for them to emigrate. Gorbachev subsequently opened the country’s borders, clearing the way for an estimated 1.6 million Jews to emigrate.

In Israel, Sharansky has spent a lengthy career in politics and public service. He also has authored three books and received a number of prestigious recognitions, including Israel’s highest award, the Israel Prize, as well as the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom and Congressional Gold Medal.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/04/sharansky-to-use-israels-genesis-prize-proceeds-to-fight-chinese-coronavirus/
['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-05-04,Lebanon Appeals to I.M.F. for Bailout as Economy Collapses,"Beirut (AFP) — Protest-hit Lebanon has approved an economic rescue plan and requested aid from the International Monetary Fund as it battles its worst financial crisis in decades.

But how did Lebanon become one of the most indebted countries in the world? What’s the plan out of this quagmire, and how likely is it to work?

– How did we get here? –

After the 1975-1990 civil war, Lebanon set about rebuilding, launching itself on a path of endless borrowing and ballooning debt.

Successive governments focused on developing an economy built around services and tourism, and fuelled by foreign investment, all dependent on stability.

But they neglected structural reforms, as a political class deeply divided along sectarian lines allowed cronyism and graft.

“The economic crisis is, at its core, a governance crisis emanating from a dysfunctional sectarian system that hindered rational policymaking and permitted a culture of corruption and waste,” experts wrote in a January report published by Carnegie Middle East.

Over the years, Lebanon was also rocked by a wave of assassinations, the 2006 war with Israel and then a series of attacks after war broke out in Syria in 2011.

Repeated political deadlocks stalled decision-making, with lawmakers on one occasion failing to elect a new president for more than two years.

The debt grew as spending increased, including to subsidise a loss-making electricity sector dependent on fuel imports and to pay high interest rates on the loans themselves.

The balance of payments deficit also deepened as growth slowed, while an oversized banking sector offered huge interests on deposits.

By late 2019, Lebanon had racked up a debt equivalent to 170 percent of its GDP.

The pound has plummeted from 1,507 to more than 4,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar on the parallel market in recent weeks, and inflation has soared.

Banks imposed crippling capital controls in the autumn, while deteriorating living conditions sparked mass cross-sectarian protests.

– What’s the plan? –

An economic reform plan the cabinet approved on April 30 aims to unlock foreign aid, restructure the debt, and cut back on spending including in the electricity sector.

Lebanon aims to drum up $10 billion in financial support, on top of $11 billion in grants and loans pledged by international donors in 2018.

But the five-year austerity plan includes measures likely to be unpopular such as a freeze on recruitment in the public sector.

It has also been calculated according to an exchange rate of 3,500 pounds to the dollar.

Nasser Yassin, associate professor of policy and planning at the American University in Beirut, said the plan was a good “diagnosis” of the situation but not complete.

“It’s an attempt to solve this thorny crisis through financial and accounting tools to obtain foreign aid through the IMF, yet it imposes harsh conditions when it comes to social benefits and austerity measures,” he said.

“The poorest levels of society and the middle class are the ones who will pay the price, with high inflation and the contraction of the economy expected.”

Up to 45 percent of Lebanon’s population already lives in poverty, official estimates show.

– Will it work? –

Yassin said such a plan to “redesign the state’s financial management” could have benefitted from more consultations on how to break away from the old model of a free-market economy to attract foreign capital.

Its implementation is expected to run up against the interests of political parties in the public sector, he added.

Mohammad Faour, a research fellow in banking and finance at University College Dublin, agreed much depended on “how cooperative the political class will be in enacting them in parliament”.

“There’s always this worry that political bickering will get in the way,” he said.

MPs will need to approve many parts of the plan, including accepting foreign aid, restructuring the debt, and imposing new taxes.

President Michel Aoun has invited the leaders of all parliamentary blocs to discuss the plan Wednesday.

The government, formed in January after protests ousted its predecessor, does not enjoy huge popular support.

But it is backed by key political forces including Shiite movement Hezbollah, which has seats in parliament despite the United States — and now Germany — labelling it as “terrorist”.

“It will be a hard slog, but Lebanon can get back on its feet with a solid reform plan that is front-loaded with international support,” Faour said.

“But the main concern is whether internal politics will permit the implementation of a credible plan.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/04/lebanon-appeals-to-i-m-f-for-bailout-as-economy-collapses/
['Deborah Danan'],2020-05-03,High Court Weighs Whether to Allow Indicted Netanyahu to Be PM,"TEL AVIV – Israel’s High Court of Justice on Sunday held the first hearing, which was broadcast live on television, about whether to allow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form the next government despite his indictment in three corruption cases.

The hearing, which is set to continue on Monday and Tuesday, also covered whether certain aspects of the rotational unity government deal struck between the Likud and Blue and White parties are constitutional.

The deal’s validity was challenged in eight separate petitions, with the main argument being members of Knesset indicted on corruption charges cannot serve as prime minister.

According to the terms of the deal, Netanyahu will serve as prime minister for a year and a half after which Blue and White head Benny Gantz will replace him.

According to Anar Herman, who represented Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit at the hearing, Netanyahu “in the current situation is not disqualified from serving as prime minister.”

An attorney for Netanyahu’s Likud party averred that the entire process of selecting a prime minister “is a constitutional process, not an administrative one.

“It’s inappropriate for the court to intervene in the constitutional judgment of the people and the members of Knesset,” the attorney said in remarks translated by The Times of Israel.

Michael Ravilo, representing Netanyahu, said it would have been preferable for the court to have thrown out the petitions immediately rather than involving itself “in these political issues.”

Attorney Avital Sompolinsky, representing the Knesset’s legal department, said the “decision is so political and complex, touching on the relationship between the Knesset and the government,” and the court should “adopt the view that it can enter this sensitive and deeply politicized arena only in the most extreme cases.”

Indeed, it seemed that as the day’s hearing drew to a close the 11-panel bench moved towards not barring Netanyahu from setting up a government.

At one stage, Chief Justice Esther Hayut seemed to lose her temper as she demanded the petitioners provide a basis for their demand.

“Show us something! A law! A verdict! From this country’s [history]! From [somewhere else] in the world! Something!,” Hayut said according to the Times of Israel. “After all, [you’re asking us to set] a global precedent! You want us to rule without a basis simply according to your personal opinion?”

Suzie Navot, a constitutional law expert, told Channel 12 the sense was the justices were saying it was up to the Knesset, and not the High Court, to legislate.

She said it would be difficult to imagine a scenario whereby the court would determine that contravening the public’s faith in governing authorities was justified.

Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said if the court rules Netanyahu cannot serve, it would amount to “an unprecedented attack on Israeli democracy.”

The coalition deal is “a necessity, the result of three election campaigns and a desire among Israelis to avoid a fourth election,” he said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/03/high-court-weighs-whether-to-allow-indicted-netanyahu-to-be-pm/
['Simon Kent'],2020-05-03,Iran Rush to Reopen Mosques as Coronavirus Lockdown Eases: Rouhani,"Iran President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday mosques would reopen across one third of the country within 24-hours, after they were shuttered early in March as the Middle East’s deadliest Chinese coronavirus outbreak took hold.

Rouhani said 132 counties would “reopen their mosques as of tomorrow,” the semi–official Tasnim news agency reported.

“Social distancing is more important than collective prayer,” Rouhani added, arguing Islam considers safety obligatory, while praying in mosques is only “recommended”.

The targeted counties are “low-risk”, Rouhani said in a televised meeting of the country’s virus taskforce.

The ministry said the trajectory of infections has started a “gradual” downward trend in Iran, where the death toll is 6,156 and total number of diagnosed cases has reached 96,448.

The Islamic republic has tried to contain the spread of the virus by denying public entry to universities, cinemas, stadiums and other public spaces since March as the full scale of the crisis gradually emerged.

But it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy since April 11, arguing the sanctions-hit country cannot afford to remain closed for business.

Only “high-risk” businesses like gyms and barbershops remain closed, with Rouhani adding “We will continue the reopenings calmly and gradually.”

Iran’s mosques will hope to avoid the dramatic scenes sometimes evident at the start of the epidemic where some Muslim faithful demanded the right to continue worshipping practices at holy shrines that included kissing, touching and in some cases licking sacred public objects.

When state TV initially announced the shrines’ closure, mass protests followed.

“We are here to say that Tehran is damn wrong to do that!” one Shiite cleric shouted at the shrine in Mashhad, according to an online video. Others joined him in chanting: “The health minister is damn wrong to do that, the president is damn wrong to do that!”

As Breitbart News reported, strict Muslim religious observance is often at odds with state control in Iran.

Earlier in March online videos emerged showing the faithful licking and kissing shrines to show they had no fear of coronavirus infection.

['Chris Tomlinson'],2020-05-03,Italian Jews Angered By 'Work Sets You Free' Poster for May Day,"Members of the Italian Jewish community expressed anger after the Naples city government created a poster to celebrate May Day containing the same phrase used on the gates of the Auschwitz death camp.

The phrase “solo il lavoro rende liberi” or “only work makes you free” was seen on the posters created by the Naples Department of Social and Work Policies — nearly identical to the Auschwitz gate’s infamous “Arbeit Macht Frei” or “work sets you free” slogan.

The Naples Jewish community reacted immediately to the posters, saying: “We consider the episode a dangerous example of how direct knowledge of what has happened has less and less consideration in certain administrations, evidently more accustomed to the trivialization of historical events than to the correct perception of their correct meaning.”

Monica Buonanno, the Councilor for Social Policies and Labor for the Municipality of Naples, quickly changed the posters to the phrase “only work creates dignity” and claimed that the stress of the coronavirus outbreak had led to the misstep.

Lydia Schapirer, president of the Naples Jewish community, said that “such casual use of words, reveals unacceptable superficiality, insensitivity and ignorance on the part of an institution.”

Many leftist politicians, trade unions and other groups were forced to engage in May Day celebrations online rather than in person due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The data has also been used as an excuse for violence by militant far-left Antifa extremists in cities like Paris and Berlin, with the latter seeing some violence this year when a team of journalists from broadcaster ZDF were attacked by a group of around 15 people.

Four members of the television crew were rushed to the hospital due to their injuries, with two seriously injured. Police arrested five men and a woman in connection with the incident, with all believed to be far-left extremists.

['John Hayward'],2020-05-01,Dissidents: Coronavirus Disaster Prompts Protest Wave in Iran,"According to Iranian resistance groups, a new mass protest movement is gaining steam in every corner of Iran, with people hitting the streets to protest the regime’s poor economic policies and hideous bungling of the coronavirus crisis.

The opposition PMOI/MEK reported stonemasons and the owners of fruit stores holding a rally on Wednesday to protest “poor economic conditions that have become unbearable for the general public.”

On the same day, employees of a provincial electric company in northeastern Iran reportedly held a rally to protest being required to work without adequate protection against the Wuhan coronavirus. Protesters said officials ignored their requests for gloves, masks, and disinfectant.

Tuesday reportedly saw protests from villagers in the Kurdistan region, including employees of the Sarigoni gold mine, who were angered that mine officials have replaced them with workers from other areas who are willing to accept lower wages, and employees of a water company in southwestern Iran who said their wages and pensions have been withheld. Dozens of workers allegedly went on strike in northwestern Iran for similar reasons, defying coronavirus-related orders to remain indoors so they could march in the streets.

Municipal workers across the country have protested slow payment of their wages, poor benefits, and ham-fisted attempts by the regime to suppress their protests instead of addressing their concerns.

“We have not been paid or received our pensions since February. Some workers have been summoned by authorities and we have been accused of provoking other workers to hold gatherings and protest rallies. They constantly resort to crackdown measures instead of paying our salaries and answering our questions,” one protester is quoted as saying.

“They’re demanding fees for internet service in our kids’ schools, their supplies, etc. The monthly rent for the store, the mortgage, both have risen, and all the while we are experiencing a bear market and we have no income. What else should I tell you? There’s not a single official willing to listen to these troubles. Name me one official who understands the people’s pains. They said they won’t return any checks, but they did. They said we won’t be demanding lease payments, but again they did. They said the price of bread won’t rise, but it did. They said food prices won’t rise, but it did. Show me one official who comes and listens to the people’s problems, and actually takes some action,” complained another.

In the coastal regions of southern Iran, PMOI claimed that fishermen protested shortages of fuel for the boats and price-gouging for gasoline, while farmers rallied to demand promised compensation for recent floods, and residents of the city of Rasht complained their deposits have been frozen by local banks.

Iranian state media has acknowledged the growing number of protests and expressed fears they could coalesce into a national movement with the potential for violence – or, to put it more cynically, a national movement threatening enough for the regime to use violence to suppress it.

“This time the protests will be more intense and violent,” one state-run daily warned last week. “It can be described as a super-movement protest in the country that will be attended by most of the lower and middle classes.”

Some Iranian state papers are predicting total economic collapse as a consequence of the coronavirus, while media more closely aligned with President Hassan Rouhani and his faction of the Iranian government are running optimistic editorials about Iranians setting aside their differences and coming together to recover from the pandemic.

Some of those editorials judiciously admitted the regime might have to address the obvious inequality between comfortable, highly-paid officials and impoverished citizens in order to defuse public anger.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/05/01/dissidents-coronavirus-disaster-prompts-protest-wave-in-iran/
['Simon Kent'],2020-05-01,Iran Warns Germany of 'Consequences' for Banning Hezbollah Terrorists,"Germany’s total ban on Lebanon’s Hezbollah terrorist organization drew a swift response Friday from Iran, with the Islamic republic saying “consequences” would follow.

As Breitbart News reported, Hezbollah was labeled a “Shiite terrorist organisation” with dozens of police and special forces storming mosques and associations across Germany linked to the terror group.

German political support followed swiftly.

Hezbollah activities “violate criminal law and the organization opposes the concept of international understanding,” German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in announcing the move.

“Hezbollah denies Israel’s right to exist, threatens violence and terror and continues to massively upgrade its rocket arsenal,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Twitter. “We in Germany must exhaust the means of the rule of law to take action against the criminal and terrorist activities of Hezbollah.”

The German crackdown on Hezbollah means its flags are banned at all demonstrations and meetings across the country. Berlin’s municipal government already bans Hezbollah symbols and flags at demonstrations.

Germany, like most of Europe, has until now dragged its feet in outlawing both the military and political arms of the Lebanon-based group to protect relations with Beirut and Tehran.

The U.S., UK, Netherlands and Israel designates the anti-Israel group in its entirety a terror organization.

Iran’s foreign ministry rejected the ban by saying it ignores “realities in West Asia,” according to the Tehran Times.

It “strongly” condemned the decision it said showed “complete disrespect to the government and nation of Lebanon, as Hezbollah is a formal and legitimate part of the country’s government and parliament.”

Iran said Hezbollah had a “key role in fighting Daesh’s terrorism in the region,” using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group.

“The German government must face the negative consequences of its decision in the fight against real terrorist groups in the region,” it added.

Iran has long been a major supporter of the group and its terror attacks on Israel.

Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Berlin and the acting U.S. director of national intelligence, urged all European Union countries to follow Germany and outlaw Hezbollah’s activities.

The organization “cannot be allowed to use Europe as a safe haven to support terrorism in Syria and across the Middle East,” he said.

“The world is a little bit safer with this German government ban of Hezbollah. The entire U.S. embassy in Berlin has worked with the German government and the Bundestag for two years to push for this ban. It’s an incredible diplomatic success that we hope will motivate many officials in Brussels to follow suit with an EU-wide ban,” Grenell told FoxNew.com in an interview.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/05/01/iran-warns-germany-of-consequences-for-total-ban-on-hezbollah/
['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-30,Germany Finally Outlaws Hezbollah Terror Group,"TEL AVIV – Germany on Thursday announced it officially recognizes all of Hezbollah, and not just its military wing, as a terrorist organization, marking a departure from its previous position which was in line with the EU.

Hezbollah activities “violate criminal law and the organization opposes the concept of international understanding,” German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in a statement.

Germany, like most of Europe, has until now dragged its feet in outlawing both the military and political arms of the Lebanon-based group out of concerns this would harm relations with Beirut.

The U.S., UK, Netherlands and Israel designates the group in its entirety a terror organization.

“Just as it is not possible to distinguish between political and religious members of the organization, it is also not possible to divide the organization into its political, social and military wings,” a 32-page long document from the Germany’s Interior Ministry states.

German police on Thursday morning raided mosques and residences associated with Hezbollah in various locations across the country after the ban was announced.

Even though there is no official branch of Hezbollah in Germany, security officials believe up to 1,050 people are affiliated with the group and the country has been used as both a recruiting and fundraising base, Reuters reported.

Hezbollah symbols may not be used publicly in any assembly, print, audio or visual material in Germany, and its assets will be confiscated “to the benefit of the Federal Republic of Germany,” the Interior Ministry’s statement reads.

“Violations of bans on organizations and activities are equally punishable,” the statement continues.

Hezbollah “openly calls for the violent elimination of the State of Israel and questions the right of the State of Israel to exist. The organization is therefore fundamentally against the concept of international understanding, regardless of whether it presents itself as a political, social or military structure.”

German security authorities can “use all available instruments of the rule of law to crack down on terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and take strict measures against their activities in Germany,” the statement adds.

“The organization is therefore fundamentally against the concept of international understanding, regardless of whether it presents itself as a political, social or military structure,” the German Interior Ministry said.

“Its violent denial of the right to exist of the state of Israel also fundamentally opposes Germany’s national ethos,” a separate Interior Ministry document states.

Foreign Minister Israel Katz lauded the decision as “very important and values-based.

Banning Hezbollah is “significant in the world battle against terror,” Katz added. “I want to express my appreciation to the German government for this step and am certain many governments in the Middle East and victims of Hezbollah’s terrorism share my gratitude.”

Katz called on the EU and other European states to follow suit and declare that “Hezbollah, its military and political arms, is a terrorist organization and must be treated that way.”

The American Jewish Committee also welcomed the move.

“This is a welcome, much-anticipated, and significant German decision,” AJC head David Harris said. “We now hope other European nations will take a close look at Germany’s decision and reach the same conclusion about the true nature of Hezbollah.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/04/30/germany-outlaws-hezbollah-terror-group-raids-mosques/

Hezbollah has been engaged in a propaganda campaign against the Chinese coronavirus throughout Lebanon, a response, in part, to outrage from the Lebanese people over its outsized influence on the country’s government and rumors that Hezbollah’s ties to the Islamic regime in Iran resulted in the country’s domestic outbreak. Iran is experiencing one of the most destructive Chinese coronavirus epidemics in the world; dissident groups estimate that nearly 40,000 people have died there.

Hezbollah claims to be working alongside Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), also a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, in combating the virus.

“I earn $600, but I used to receive at least double that amount in dental care, gas subsidies, food supplies, and many others. A lot of the financial support we used to get has now been slashed,” a man named Abou Hadi, who al-Arabiya identified as a Hezbollah “fighter,” told the news agency. Hadi claimed to have fought in the Syrian Civil War – Shiite groups support dictator Bashar al-Assad – and suffered multiple injuries that require medical attention. Hezbollah promised to support him if he engaged in jihad on their behalf, but that support is allegedly dwindling.

“To get extra financial support or food aid, you need to be close to certain commanders. It’s all about waste [nepotism] now,” Hadi lamented. “That never happened before, the organization used to operate in a fair manner and took good care of its fighters. That is not the case anymore.”

“Fighters are complaining that there is more bureaucracy and red tape, which is making access to basic healthcare more complicated,” another unnamed source said in the report, adding that the combination of excessive spending and sanctions on the terrorist organization is forcing it to increasingly rely on Lebanese government funds.

President Donald Trump significantly increased sanctions on both the Iranian government and Hezbollah throughout his tenure, resulting in mounting reports of financial woes within the terrorist group and its patron government. Last year, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook told Congress that Hezbollah’s finances were so bad that the group was resorting to begging for donations.

“In March [2019], Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, went on TV and made a public appeal for donations,” Hook said. “Hezbollah has placed piggy banks in grocery stores and in retail outlets seeking the spare change of people.”

“Budget cuts” have made it harder of Hezbollah to pay its Syrian Civil War veteran jihadists a bonus they had come to expect, al-Arabiya noted.

In the beginning of the Middle East wing of the pandemic in March, Hezbollah immediately developed a publicity blitz in Lebanon, promising ambulances, hand sanitizers, and medical care. The party had just come off a 2019 in which many of the naiton’s youth had turned against it, organizing large protests demanding a more representative government. By February, given Hezbollah’s ties with Iran, even Lebanese celebrities were openly accusing Hezbollah of bringing the virus to their country.

“Only because we don’t want to upset Hezbollah, we don’t stop Iran flights. On top of all that, they tell us not to panic!” Elissa, a Lebanese pop star, opined.

Al-Arabiya cited a study by the Middle East Policy Center that estimates Hezbollah commands a sprawling healthcare system within Lebanon including “at least three hospitals, 12 health centers, 20 infirmaries, and 20 dental clinics,” largely created to help its jihadists engage in wartime activities in Syria and Iraq.

“Hezbollah says it is turning the organizational might it once deployed to fight Israel or in the civil war in neighboring Syria to battle the spread of the virus pandemic in Lebanon,” the Associated Press reported at the time, noting that Hezbollah was restructuring hospitals used to treat wounded jihadis for coronavirus patients.

In April, Ha’aretz reported that Hezbollah held a parade of 100 ambulances and medical teams affiliated with the terrorist group to galvanize popular support. It also made sure to invite friendly journalists to witness how it was refurnishing medical assets for the Chinese coronavirus “war,” as leader Hassan Nasrallah branded it. Iranian government outlets like PressTV regularly posted content celebrating the jihadist organization. Nasrallah also repeatedly accused the United States of fabricating coronavirus data, branding President Donald Trump and his administration “the worst liars.”

“For Hezbollah, COVID-19 is more than an illness: It’s also an opportunity to amass more political power, especially as one of its representatives, Dr. Hamad Hasan, also heads the Public Health Ministry,” the Israeli newspaper reported.

Last year’s protests in Lebanon have returned despite coronavirus “social distancing” measures. Hundreds took the streets of Tripoli this week after police killed a protester, participating in one of many events demanding the government do more to prevent the collapse of the country’s already precarious economy. The protests turned violent on Tuesday as participants used Molotov cocktails and rocks to attack police.

Lebanon has, at press time, documented 725 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 24 deaths.

['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-30,"Saudi TV Show Features Hebrew Monologue, Calls for Ties with Israel","TEL AVIV – Two new Saudi TV shows sparked outrage among Arab nations and others, including the Hamas terror group, for featuring characters speaking Hebrew and calling for better ties between the Gulf kingdom and Israel.

The opening monologue of the first episode of “Umm Haroun” (The Mother of Aaron) was spoken in Hebrew. “Before our footsteps go missing and our lives fall into memory, we will be lost to time,” a Jewish woman says in the opening scene. “We are the Gulf Jews who were born in the Gulf lands.”

The show, which premiered during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, portrays relations between Muslims and Jews in 1940s Kuwait and features a slew of well-known Saudi and Kuwaiti actors including Hayat al-Fahd, who plays the eponymous heroine.

It also features the character of a rabbi.

Meanwhile a second TV show broadcast in Saudi Arabia, “Exit 7,” includes a character calling for improved relations with Israel. The character also accuses the Palestinians of vilifying Saudi Arabia.

Many critics took to social media to express their outrage.

The Gaza-ruling Hamas terror group said “Umm Haroun” was a “political and cultural attempt to introduce the Zionist project to Persian Gulf society.”

“The character of Umm Haroun reminds me of [Israeli prime minister] Golda Meir, the head of the occupation, who was a murderous criminal. This is the goal of normalization: hatred, slow killing and internal destruction,” Hamas official Ra’fat Murra said.

['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-29,World Jewish Congress President Ron Lauder Blasts De Blasio for ‘Feeding Antsemites’,"TEL AVIV — World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder said his organization should formally censure New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for singling out the Jewish community in a series of tweets over violations of coronavirus restrictions.

“Last night, the Mayor painted the Jewish community as lawbreakers and unconcerned about the city’s public health. I agree with the Mayor that social distancing is vitally important — and last night’s gathering was not appropriate,” Lauder said in a statement.

“But to blame the entire Jewish community is the type of stereotyping that is dangerous and unacceptable at any time, and particularly pernicious while the world is gripped in fear and the worst among us are looking for scapegoats,” he said.

Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews gathered Tuesday night in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn to pay their respects to the deceased, Rabbi Chaim Mertz.

De Blasio personally supervised police as they broke up the funeral procession, which was not carried out in adherence to social distancing regulations although pictures show many wearing masks.

“Something absolutely unacceptable happened in Williamsburg tonite: a large funeral gathering in the middle of this pandemic,” de Blasio wrote on Twitter.

“When I heard, I went there myself to ensure the crowd was dispersed. And what I saw WILL NOT be tolerated so long as we are fighting the Coronavirus,” he said.

“My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed,” the mayor added. “I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period.”

De Blasio came under fire for calling out the Jewish community.

Lauder charged de Blasio with feeding into the “dangerous agenda of white supremacists and antisemites” with his tweet.

Lauder added, “Mayor de Blasio needs to realize that while he, like all of us, believes in the importance of social distancing, every time a leader like him stereotypes the ‘Jewish community,’ he feeds into the dangerous agenda of white supremacists and antisemites around the world. It needs to end.”

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also slammed the mayor.

“Would DeBlasio have sent this identical tweet with the word ‘Jewish’ replaced by any other religious minority? If not, why not? Laws should be enforced neutrally w/o targeting religious faith. #ProtectFreeExercise,” he tweeted.

Anti-Defamation League head Jonathan Greenblatt similarly denounced de Blasio for calling out the entire Jewish community over an errant minority.

Hey @NYCMayor, there are 1mil+ Jewish people in #NYC. The few who don’t social distance should be called out — but generalizing against the whole population is outrageous especially when so many are scapegoating Jews. This erodes the very unity our city needs now more than ever. https://t.co/jcYO9QQred — Jonathan Greenblatt (@JGreenblattADL) April 29, 2020

The Satmar Headquarters said on Twitter that the funeral had been approved by the mayor. Satmar is the Hassidic sect that comprises most of the ultra-Orthodox population in Williamsburg.

This Funeral was originally approved and actually organized by @NYPDnews 2 hours b4 it started, PD brought trucks with barriers/tower lights to close off Bedford Avenue and the surrounding area. It's the @NYCMayor’s Dept who originally approved it before deciding to take it back. https://t.co/i1EtGvCkKO — Satmar Headquarters (@HQSatmar) April 29, 2020

Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro blasted de Blasio for his comments.

“I can’t imagine de Blasio saying this about any other community. It’s pretty amazing. And for the record, MANY of the leaders of the Jewish community have taken strong stands on social distancing.”

Twitter user Sofia Bitela wrote: “This is really a tone deaf and disgusting tweet by the mayor. First of all, the [ultra-Orthodox] rarely intermingle outside of their community. How are they a threat to other New Yorkers?”

She added: “Second, they may the community closet to herd immunity in NYC or the US. Leave them alone.”

De Blasio was also criticized for not calling out the hundreds of New Yorkers who gathered, shoulder to shoulder, to watch the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds flyover in honor of the city’s healthcare workers.

Why did DeBlasio single out Jews and not general NYC crowds that gathered to watch flyover? https://t.co/R75FNxMVP8 — Aaron Klein (@AaronKleinShow) April 29, 2020

['John Hayward'],2020-04-29,Taliban Demands Coronavirus Protection for Jailed Jihadis,"The Taliban issued a statement on Wednesday claiming that 46 of its fighters have contracted the Wuhan coronavirus while imprisoned by the Afghan government and vowing to seek revenge if any of them died.

The Taliban statement, as quoted by the Khaama Press Agency, also threatened to hold the United States responsible for not moving quickly enough to free all Taliban operatives from Afghan jails:

We had previously warned that the prisoner situation in the Kabul administration jails is dire as facilities are packed and there are widespread issues regarding food, drink and medicine availability therefore if the novel coronavirus were to enter these prisons, it could prove catastrophic. Responsibility here falls squarely on the shoulders of the United States of America because if it had shown urgency in the implementation of the agreement, we could have made major progress in all facets including the release of prisoners and detainees would have been saved from this danger. The Kabul administration officials along with the supposed human right organizations and those raising humanitarian slogans all failed at taking this issue seriously and have pushed the situation to the brink. The Islamic Emirate has serious concerns about the health of its prisoners and calls on the various international right organizations to not treat this humanitarian issue in a tactful or political manner, but to properly execute their responsibilities in saving the lives of human beings. All sides must understand that if the prisoners of the Islamic Emirate are lost, each one will be asked about and revenge taken upon the cold-hearted enemy.

“Islamic Emirate” is the Taliban’s preferred name for itself, calling back to the days when it controlled the government of Afghanistan.

The Taliban has made the most of the coronavirus as a political and propaganda opportunity, running an ostentatious health campaign and promising not to kill healthcare workers who enter areas under its control, as it previously had a habit of doing.

Long suspicious of Western medicine as a conspiracy to poison its fighters, the Taliban changed course when the coronavirus pandemic hit and began loudly demanding cooperation with medical personnel from Afghans under its control, although there were some reports of continuing reluctance by the Taliban extremists to allow women to visit doctors.

The Taliban claims it is fully cooperating with the World Health Organization and medical teams sent by the government in Kabul while using the pandemic to tighten its control over villages and constantly criticizing the government for an inadequate pandemic response.

Taliban fighters might have sworn off murdering doctors and nurses, but they do not seem reluctant to shoot at anyone else loyal to Kabul. For that matter, the government of President Ashraf Ghani reports Taliban jihadis are still harassing health care workers despite their claims to the contrary.

The Chinese government on Wednesday pledged to send more coronavirus assistance to Afghanistan as the number of confirmed infections approaches 2,000.

“Based on the new demand of Afghanistan for fighting the epidemic, the Chinese embassy in Kabul has arranged another charter flight to deliver the second batch of anti-epidemic materials assistance to Afghanistan,” said Wang Yu, China’s ambassador to Afghanistan.

“The materials we are going to hand over are from China International Development Cooperation Agency and other Chinese organizations. This batch includes more materials than the first batch, including test kits, medical protective masks, surgical masks, protective clothing, protective goggles and infrared temperature guns. The total materials are in 727 boxes, weighing 7.2 tons,” Wang said.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/04/29/taliban-demands-coronavirus-protection-for-jailed-jihadis/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-29,Lebanon: Protester Death Triggers Hundreds Rioting,"Hundreds of protesters set two banks on fire and clashed with security forces in Tripoli, Lebanon, on Tuesday, after soldiers shot a man dead during related protests the night before.

Citizens across Lebanon have been demonstrating to express their frustration at the country’s ongoing financial crisis, made worse by recent Chinese coronavirus lockdown measures, Voice of America (VOA) reported on Tuesday.

Some protesters aimed stones at soldiers and launched Molotov cocktails at several banks on Tuesday, causing widespread damage to Tripoli, a largely Sunni Muslim city and one of Lebanon’s most impoverished and neglected areas. Medical and security forces told VOA that Tuesday’s outbursts began shortly after the funeral for a man killed by soldiers during demonstrations on Monday night.

The violence prompted the army to fire rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds of protesters.

Video footage obtained by Saudi news organization al-Arabiya shows demonstrators on Tuesday night gathered in the street, as soldiers are heard firing what seem to be rounds of tear gas and warning shots in the background.

The Lebanese army said that 40 soldiers were wounded in Tripoli and elsewhere in Lebanon on Monday night. Security patrols sent to reopen roads [as part of Lebanon’s easing of coronavirus lockdown measures] were attacked with stones. Nine protesters were arrested for attacking security forces, the Epoch Times reported.

In response to the unrest, Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab reminded the public that “we are facing a new reality” amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures, which threaten to decimate Lebanon’s failing economy.

Diab warned that “malicious intentions behind the scenes” were “shaking stability,” an apparent reference to what the Lebanese army called “infiltrators” who the army blamed for injecting violence into Tripoli’s protests, the Epoch Times reports. The army urged peaceful protesters to leave the streets.

“This is not a riot, this is expressing [anger] that the [U.S.] dollar has reached 4,000 Lebanese pounds … How are people going to eat?” said Tripoli activist Abou Hussein, according to VOA.

Hussein referred to the collapse of the Lebanese pound amid the country’s financial crisis, which has been worsening since October. The economic decline has left tens of thousands of Lebanese unemployed and frustrated, leading many citizens to protest the conditions in Tripoli and other cities.

Lebanon, like most countries around the world, has imposed restrictions on society to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has further pummeled the country’s economy. Lebanon’s coronavirus lockdown measures began on March 15, closing most businesses and allowing only essential movement.

The restrictions have been gradually easing in recent days. Some restrictions may be extended until May 10, Reuters reported on April 24.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/04/29/lebanon-protester-death-triggers-hundreds-rioting-coronavirus-cripples-economy/
['Frances Martel'],2020-04-29,Kurds Blame Jihadist Turkey Allies for Deadly Bombing in Afrin,"Kurdish governing authorities in Afrin, northeast Syria, condemned the Turkish government on Wednesday for enabling jihadist groups they say are responsible for killing over 40 people in a bomb blast in the city the day before.

The Kurdish news outlet Rudaw also reported on Turkey-allied jihadist organizations desecrating Yazidi shrines in the area. While most Yazidis originate in northern Iraq, the Islamic State invasion of their territory in 2014 forced survivors elsewhere, many to Kurdish-held areas in Syria.

The Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) make up much of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of anti-jihadist forces in Rojava, or Syrian Kurdistan. Afrin is located in Rojava and has been under the invasion of Turkish forces and auxiliary groups like the Free Syrian Army (FSA) since the 2018 military attack President Recep Tayyip Erdogan named “Operation Olive Branch.” It is currently occupied by Turkey.

While not formally allied with the YPG, the dictatorship of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad also opposes any Turkish presence in Syria. Erdogan asserted in 2016 that the only reason he would ever send troops across the Syrian border would be to “end the rule of the tyrant Assad.” Both leaders have called each other “terrorists.”

Afrin has been largely occupied by Turkey-allied forces since Operation Olive Branch. After months of a stagnant situation in the area, complicated by concerns of a regional outbreak of Chinese coronavirus, a fuel tanker exploded in the center of the city on Tuesday. The truck, Rudaw reported, was “laced with explosives” and killed 42. The blast injured at least another 50 people, the outlet cited Kurdish sources as saying. The explosion occurred in one of the busiest times of the day in the city; there did not appear to be any social distancing protocols in place.

Rudaw quoted several Kurdish officials who said the dead were civilians in the area, many to visit a crowded market. As the area is largely Kurdish in population, most can be considered Kurds, but many remains are unidentifiable and authorities have not offered the identities of any of the victims.

Kurdish officials in Afrin blame Turkish-affiliated militant groups, though they have not named any in particular. The Turkish government blames the YPG and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).

Turkey considers the YPG and the PKK indistinguishable, although the former is a U.S. ally that played a pivotal role in fighting the Islamic State and the PKK is a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist organization.

No group has taken responsibility for the attack.

“What happened in Afrin yesterday was a condemned terrorist act which claimed the lives of innocent people. This criminal act is the outcome of destructive policy pursued by the Turkish occupation and its mercenaries in the city of peace and olives,” the commander of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, said in a statement on Tuesday.

The SDF, in an official statement separate from Abdi’s, accused Turkey of having “opened the door wide to terrorist forces to reorganize their ranks and carry out cowardly acts under Turkish protection.”

Neither, however, named any group in particular or the Turkish government itself for the attack.

Turkish officials also condemned the bombing but blamed Kurdish groups for it.

“I condemn the heinous terrorist attack on this holy day of Ramadan. I wish Allah’s mercy upon the martyrs and a quick recovery for those wounded,” Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said in a Twitter statement, according to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. “Innocent civilians’ and children’s blood are on the hands of those who support and remain silent in the face of actions of this terrorist organization.”

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu explicitly blamed the attack on “the heinous terrorist organization PKK/YPG.”

“Wishing Allah’s mercy upon the deceased. Those who support the terrorists and trying to take it off the terror list are also responsible for this cowardly attack,” Çavuşoğlu added.

The outlet Kurdistan24, which focuses largely on Iraqi Kurdistan, quoted sources in the area saying they, too, believe that Turkish-backed forces organized the bombing. While stating they had evidence suggesting this, Kurdistan24 did not specify what it was. The “activists” told the outlet that the goal of the bombing was to threaten Kurds into leaving the city “as part of a greater anti-Kurdish program of ethnic cleansing.”

One resident told Rudaw that the explosion was one of three occurring in the city in April, the others of a much smaller scale.

Rudaw also noted that Yazidis in Afrin have reported the destruction of their religious sites in the city, blaming jihadist groups.

“Cemeteries, religious shrines, and Yezidi cemeteries in Afrin have been destroyed, stolen and looted by armed groups, according to local activists,” Rudaw reported, noting that, since the Turkish invasion, the Yazidi population of Afrin has dropped from 35,000 to about 3,000 – an over 90 percent drop in population.

Complaints of Arab jihadist groups allied with Turkey engaging in ethnic cleansing against Kurds, Christians, and other minorities in the area have persisted since Operation Olive Branch launched in 2018.

“Time and time again the indigenous people of Syria are suffering, but this time is at the hands of members of the Turkish military who have been incubating ISIS terrorists,” Khalid Haider, a U.S.-based Yazidi (or Yezidi) activist, told Breitbart News in March 2018. “ISIS militants and their leaders are embedded with the Turkish military, and they are annihilating religious minorities. The world needs to wake up and stop this from happening.”

Haider said the jihadists singled out religious minorities by quizzing them on Islamic practices and killing those who answered incorrectly, resulting in particular harm to Christians and Yazidis. Most Kurds are also Sunni Muslims, however, and are signed out for their ethnicity.

That summer, reports grew of jihadist militias under the auspices of the Turkish government seizing Kurdish businesses and residences in Afrin, forcing the Kurds to relocate and repopulating the area with Arabs and Turks. Some of those captured were reportedly tortured despite being civilians.

The jihadists also desecrated the remains of those they killed. In one particularly harrowing video surfacing in October 2019, jihadists allegedly working alongside “Operation Olive Branch” appeared desecrating the body of a woman SDF fighter killed in battle, shouting “Allahu akbar!” and referring to the woman as a “prostitute.”

['Simon Kent'],2020-04-29,Iran Warns U.S. Navy in Persian Gulf to Ready for 'Hard Slap in the Face',"Iran shrugged off U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent comments about naval confrontation in the contested waters of the Persian Gulf, warning Wednesday a hard slap in the face awaits foreign perpetrators committing even “the merest violation” of the Islamic republic’s territory.

Speaking in a televised program covered by the semi-official Tasnim newsagency, Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi lashed the U.S. for allegedly causing disturbances in the Persian Gulf.

He dismissed Trump’s threat last week that the U.S. Navy will fire at Iranian boats as “psychological warfare” aimed at distracting public attention ahead of the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

As Breitbart News reported, Trump had ordered the destruction of Iranian gunboats harassing American ships.

“I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2020

Trump was reacting to ongoing reports of Iranian gunboats that continue harassing American ships in the Persian Gulf.

Last Wednesday, 11 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps gunboats repeatedly harassed six U.S. Navy warships.

Iran acknowledged their aggressive activity but chided the United States for “unprofessional and provocative actions” without offering any evidence of the same.

Now General Shekarchi has warned the U.S. to think about the consequences of any naval challenge, saying, “The Americans must have seen (it before and know well) that if they take the smallest act of aggression against the Islamic Republic’s territorial waters or the interests of our people, they would receive a slap harder than before.”

“It’s no joke when it comes to defending our country,” the general stressed.

Claiming the U.S. is a violator of international law and a problem in the region, the Iranian military official said, “Under such circumstances, if they (the U.S.) make a possible mistake and receive a slap (from Iran), it will be justifiable that they deserve such a slap.”

The General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces last week denounced the presence of American forces in the region as the “root cause of insecurity for regional countries,” warning that any future provocative move by the U.S. military will draw a merciless response from Iran’s most excellent military forces, Tasnim reported.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/04/29/iran-warns-u-s-navy-in-the-persian-gulf-get-ready-for-a-hard-slap-in-the-face/
['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-28,Palestinian Terrorist Attack on Israel’s Memorial Day Injures Woman,"TEL AVIV – A 62-year-old woman was stabbed in a suspected terrorist attack Tuesday, only minutes before a state ceremony honoring Israel’s fallen soldiers and those killed in terror attacks.

The woman, who sustained moderate to severe injuries, was standing at a bus stop near a mall in the central Israeli city of Kfar Saba when a 19-year-old Palestinian youth approached her and began stabbing her. She ran away but the youth, identified as a resident of the West Bank city of Tulkarem, gave chase.

“We gave her life-saving medical care that included stopping the bleeding and urgently evacuated her to the hospital while continuing treatment and reporting to the doctors who were waiting for us.”

Blue and White party head Benny Gantz took to Twitter to wish the woman a speedy recovery and praise the armed civilian who shot the terrorist after the attack.

['Deborah Danan'],2020-04-28,"State Dept. Ready to Recognize Application of Israeli Law in West Bank, Jordan Valley","TEL AVIV – The U.S. on Monday said it was ready to recognize Israel’s annexation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, but asked Israel’s newly formed unity government to also negotiate with the Palestinians.

“As we have made consistently clear, we are prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty and the application of Israeli law to areas of the West Bank that the vision foresees as being part of the State of Israel,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson said.

The measure would be “in the context of the Government of Israel agreeing to negotiate with the Palestinians along the lines set forth in President [Donald] Trump’s Vision,” she added, referring to the Trump administration’s peace plan.

“The annexation would be in the context of an offer to the Palestinians to achieve statehood based upon specific terms, conditions, territorial dimensions and generous economic support. This is an unprecedented and highly beneficial opportunity for the Palestinians,” the State Department spokesperson said.

Trump’s plan, which was rejected by the Palestinians sight unseen, would see the establishment of a contiguous but demilitarized Palestinian state on most of the West Bank with parts of eastern Jerusalem that are outside the Israeli security fence as its capital.

Jerusalem would remain undivided and under Israeli control.

Israel would be allowed to annex all Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jordan Valley.

On Wednesday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas threatened to cancel all agreements with Israel and the U.S. if Israel went through with annexation.

His comments came in response to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s assertion that annexation was “ultimately Israel’s decision to make.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said he was confident the U.S. would give Israel the approval in the next two months to move ahead with the plans.

“Three months ago, the Trump peace plan recognized Israel’s rights in all of [the West Bank],” Netanyahu said. “And President Trump pledged to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Jewish communities there and in the Jordan Valley.”

“A couple of months from now, I’m confident that that pledge will be honored,” Netanyahu said.

According to the terms of the deal, the issue of annexation can be voted in the Knesset on July 1 at the earliest, “after discussion between the prime minister and alternate prime minister” and with U.S. consent.

Netanyahu will serve as prime minister for a year and a half after which Gantz will replace him.

“In relation to President Trump’s declaration,” the coalition agreement states, “the prime minister and alternate prime minister will act with the US’s full agreement including mapping and international dialogue on the subject, while aiming to protect Israel’s security and strategic interests, including the need to preserve regional stability, peace agreements and working towards future peace agreements.”

The proposed measure has drawn criticism from the international community.

E.U. and U.N. officials warned against the move, with E.U. foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying it “would constitute a serious violation of international law” and the U.N. Middle East peace envoy, Nikolay Mladenov, saying it would result in a “devastating blow” to the two-state solution and regional peace.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/04/28/us-to-recognize-israel-annexation-of-west-bank-jordan-valley/

Bennett said the IDF would not stop taking military action against Iranian forces in Syria until they leave the country.

“We have moved from blocking Iran’s entrenchment in Syria to forcing it out of there, and we will not stop,” the defense minister said in a statement.

“We will not allow more strategic threats to grow just across our borders without taking action,” he said.

He made similar comments two days earlier, ahead of an alleged Israeli airstrike on an Iranian base outside Damascus.

“Keep your ears open. We’ve gone from a policy of blocking [Iran] to pushing it out,” Bennett told the 103FM radio station on Sunday according to remarks translated by The Times of Israel.

The strike, on the Mezzeh military airport in a suburb outside the capital, killed four members of a pro-Iran militia and three civilians, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

However, according to Syrian state news agency SANA, whose reliability is questionable at best, some damage was caused by the strikes on the building but there were no casualties.

SANA also reported Syrian air defense shot down the Israeli projectiles.

The airbase, said to be used by Iranian forces in Syria, has been targeted several times in alleged Israeli airstrikes.

Monday’s bombing raid was the third such attack in Syria attributed to Israel in the past 10 days.

Last week, Syria accused Israel of carrying out airstrikes on targets near Homs in the center of the country. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor later said the targets were “military posts for Iranian militias in the Palmyra desert.”

['John Hayward'],2020-04-28,Iran Arrests Editor and Journalist for Cartoon Mocking Ayatollah Khamenei,"The editor-in-chief of the Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) and one of his employees were arrested last week for publishing a cartoon on social media deemed “insulting” to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The cartoon was posted on the evening of April 23 and deleted only a few minutes later. ILNA issued a statement that night denying that the cartoon had ever been published.

“At a time when prisons are petri dishes for the COVID-19 virus, Iranian authorities should cease locking up journalists for trivial offenses like allegedly sharing a cartoon,” Sheri Mansour of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said on Monday.

According to Radio Free Europe (RFE), editor Masud Heydari is out on bail, but social media administrator Hamid Haghjoo is still imprisoned. No formal charges appear to have been filed against either of them yet, but an “investigation” is underway:

“Immediately after the publishing of the insulting image, it was ordered to be removed from the channel,” Alghasi Mehr was quoted as saying by Iranian media. “The [person in charge] of ILNA and the administrator of the Telegram channel were both arrested on the evening of [April 23],” he added. ILNA has denied any affiliation with the “disrespectful” cartoon while accusing its opponents of having faked the news agency’s logo and falsely accused it of publishing the cartoon. The cartoon mocks those promoting fake treatments to ward off the coronavirus, including drinking camel urine and inserting violet oil in the anus, under the guise of Islamic medicine. It appeared to suggest that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is supportive of such measures, depicting him as a nurse who is calling for silence.

RFE provided a copy of the cartoon. It was originally shared using ILNA’s account on the encrypted messaging platform Telegram, which is very popular in Iran. The other caricatures are of Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian, the “father of Islamic medicine,” and Mehdi Sabili, the “Islamic medicine specialist” who urged Iranians to drink camel urine:

Sabili on Sunday instructed his 60,000 Instagram followers to beat lung diseases, asthma, and the Wuhan virus by enjoying three tall glasses of camel urine per day, preferably in the “initial hot temperature” it enjoys when emerging from the camel.

Drinking camel urine is actually one of the less hideous of these “Islamic medicine” treatments. Ayatollah Tabrizian’s contribution to coronavirus quackery was the suggestion to “insert velvet oil into the anus,” while another imam has been telling his followers they need only sniff a special perfume to ward off the disease. The perfume imam got at least one of his followers killed, while several genuine medical doctors have been flogged for questioning Tabrizian’s posterior prescription.

Over 700 Iranians have been killed by guzzling methanol, which they believe kills the coronavirus even though it is a form of alcohol technically prohibited under Islamic law. Belief in methanol as a coronavirus treatment apparently began because some Iranians thought their reluctance to drink liquor was the reason their country suffered such a severe outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus, and because high-proof alcohol is an ingredient in some hand sanitizers. Since the early days of the pandemic, Iranian social media accounts have been buzzing with false stories of foreigners curing themselves of Covid-19 by drinking whiskey.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/04/28/iran-arrests-editor-and-journalist-for-cartoon-mocking-ayatollah-khamenei/
['Breitbart London'],2020-04-28,Lebanon Sees Mass Protests as Economy Falters,"AFP — Lebanese protesters confronted army troops for a second day Tuesday as anger over a spiralling economic crisis re-energised a months-old anti-government movement in defiance of a coronavirus lockdown.

Scuffles resumed in second city Tripoli in northern Lebanon as protesters hurled rocks at security forces who fired a volley of tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the demonstrators.

The violence came after a protester died on Tuesday from a bullet wound he had sustained during overnight confrontations between troops and hundreds of demonstrators in Tripoli.

Following the funeral of 26-year-old Fawaz al-Samman in the city’s central Al-Nour Square, demonstrators went on the rampage, torching and vandalising banks and military vehicles.

Sixty people were injured, including some 40 soldiers, during the overnight exchange which saw protesters throw stones at troops who fired live rounds into the air to try to disperse the angry crowds under clouds of tear gas.

Tuesday’s confrontations were the latest in a string of anti-government protests and social unrest fuelled by unprecedented inflation and a free-falling Lebanese pound that reached record lows against the dollar this week.

Angered by the financial collapse, demonstrators have rallied across Lebanon, blocking roads and attacking banks, re-energising a protest movement launched in October against a political class the activists deem inept and corrupt.

“I came down to raise my voice against hunger, poverty and rising prices,” Khaled, 41, told AFP, saying he had lost his job selling motorcycle parts and could no longer support his three children.

– ‘Increasingly desperate’ –

Lebanon is mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, now compounded by a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus which has killed 24 people and infected almost 700 others.

The Lebanese pound has lost more than half of its value on the black market, where it traded at a record low of around 4,000 pounds to the dollar this week.

Economy Minister Raoul Nehme on Tuesday said that prices have risen by 55 per cent, while the government estimates that 45 per cent of the population now lives below the poverty line.

This has unleashed a public outcry against a government that has yet to deliver a long awaited rescue plan to shore up the country’s finances more than three months since it was nominated to address the crisis.

Prime Minister Hassan Diab acknowledged that living conditions have “deteriorated at a record speed” but said on Tuesday he would not tolerate “riots” and that perpetrators would be held accountable.

UN envoy to Lebanon Jan Kubis said that the “tragic” events in Tripoli send a “warning signal”.

“This is the time to provide material support to increasingly desperate, impoverished and hungry majority of Lebanese” he said in a post on Twitter.

– ‘Social explosion’ –

Lebanon’s economic crises, compounded by unprecedented inflation and a record devaluation of the pound, has forced large chunks of the population into unemployment.

A kilo of meat which used to sell at 18,000 Lebanese pounds ($12 at the official rate) now costs 32,000 (around $22) while the price of vegetables has doubled.

With no clear government plan to exit the crisis, Lebanon is heading “towards an inevitable social explosion” Sami Nader, director of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs, told AFP.

Public anger has been increasingly directed at banks which are accused by protesters of helping a corrupt political class drive the country towards bankruptcy.

Lebanese banks, many of which are owned by prominent politicians, have since September imposed restrictions on dollar withdrawals and transfers, forcing the public to deal in the nose-diving Lebanese pound.

Since March, banks have stopped dollar withdrawals altogether, further fuelling public anger.

In Tripoli, the army accused demonstrators overnight of torching three banks, destroying several ATM machines and attacking an army patrol and military vehicle.

The Association of Lebanese Banks said that commercial banks would be closed in Tripoli on Tuesday because of “attacks and acts of vandalism”.

In the capital Beirut, a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a bank before dawn and dozens of protesters gathered at a flyover to express solidarity with their counterparts in Tripoli.

In the southern city of Sidon, protesters threw stones and fire crackers at the central bank headquarters late Monday, state media said.

Late Saturday, assailants lobbed an explosive device at a bank in Sidon.

The attack came a day after Diab said Lebanese bank deposits had plunged $5.7 billion in the first two months of the year, despite curbs on withdrawals and a ban on transfers abroad.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/04/28/lebanon-sees-mass-protests-as-economy-falters/
['Ben Kew'],2020-04-28,Iran: Over 700 Die After Drinking Methanol as 'Cure' for Coronavirus,"More than 700 Iranians have died after ingesting toxic methanol in the false belief that it provides a cure for the Chinese coronavirus, according to figures from the country’s national coroner’s authority reproduced by Australia’s ABC News on Tuesday.

The authority released a report on Monday claiming that 728 Iranians had died as a result of alcohol poisoning between February 20 and April 7. In 2019, there were only 66 deaths from the same cause across the entire year.

The figures contradict those provided by Iranian health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, who said that 525 people had died in that same time period. Yet a ministry adviser, Dr. Hossein Hassanian, told the Associated Press that the number of victims was higher than the official government tally as many people died outside of hospitals.

“Some 200 people died outside of hospitals,” he said. “Other countries have only one problem, which is the new coronavirus pandemic. But we are fighting on two fronts here. We have to both cure the people with alcohol poisoning and also fight the coronavirus.”

Fake remedies are increasingly popular across Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the Islamic regime’s response to the virus after it attempted to downplay the severity of the situation before it became widespread.

Methanol, which is a form of pure alcohol, remains illegal in Iran because of Sharia, the Islamic law. However, various bootleggers sell the product on the black market, touting its supposed benefits. Its consumption can lead to initial symptoms of chest pain, nausea, and hyperventilation, while its delayed effects include blindness and organ damage.

“People think that alcohol causes immunity to corona while drinking alcohol does not eliminate corona in the body,” the state-run Tasnim News Agency quoted one medical expert as saying. “This misconception has caused even children to drink alcohol … which can lead to death and blindness.”

Alcohol is not the only fake treatment spreading across Iran, one of the countries most severely impacted by the coronavirus. Last month, state media promoted various herbal treatments as a cure for the virus, while an Islamic prophetic medicine healer recently prescribed camel urine to his patients suffering from symptoms.

As of Tuesday morning, Iranian medical authorities had confirmed 92,584 cases of the coronavirus and 5,877 fatalities. At least 72,439 people have already made a full recovery. Yet various officials, including the head of the Tehran city council, have questioned the legitimacy of such figures, arguing than the “actual numbers are several times higher than what is being announced by the government.”

['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-04-28,Erdogan Backs Cleric Who Claims Homosexuality Brings Disease,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday threw his weight behind Turkey’s top Muslim cleric, who caused a storm by claiming homosexuality “brings disease and causes this generation to decay.”

In his first sermon during the holy month of Ramadan on Friday, Ali Erbas also maintained that hundreds of thousands of people every year are exposed to HIV due to homosexuality and adultery and called on worshipers to come together to fight “this kind of evil.”

Opposition and rights groups condemned the comments by Erbas, who heads Turkey’s Religious Affairs Presidency.

But in a public address following a Cabinet meeting Monday, Erdogan said any attack on Erbas amounted to an attack on the state.

Erdogan — a pious Muslim whose ruling party has roots in Turkey’s Islamic movement — said Erbas had fulfilled the duties of “faith, the wisdom (of Islam) and of his office” and that his words were binding for all Muslims. He said the tone of the criticism against the cleric had turned into a “deliberate attack against Islam.”

The Ankara-based Human Rights Association has filed a criminal complaint against Erbas, accusing him of sedition, and the Ankara lawyers’ association accused him of inciting hatred. The association called for his removal from office, saying it would not be surprised if the cleric were next to call on people “to light torches and burn women as witches.”

Meanwhile, the Ankara chief prosecutor’s office said it was launching a criminal investigation against the Ankara lawyers’ group for “insulting religious values.” Many ruling party officials and supporters have also rallied around Erbas on Twitter.

The fatalities recorded in the past 24 hours brought to 5,877 the overall death toll from the illness in the Middle East’s hardest-hit country.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 1,112 people tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.

That took to 92,584 the total number of infections recorded in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February.

Iran says 72,439 of those admitted to hospital with the virus have recovered and been discharged.

Its latest figures came a day after the ministry announced its daily infection count had fallen to 991 — below 1,000 for the first time since March 10.

Doubts have been cast over Iran’s coronavirus casualty figures by experts and officials both at home and abroad.

State television on Tuesday aired footage from Tehran grocery stores where posters urged customers to observe social distancing rules.

“The majority do not respect these instructions,” a salesman told the channel.

A bus driver complained about passengers who were failing to abide by government guidelines.

“People always pay in cash,” he said, expressing concern over a method of payment discouraged by the authorities as it increases the risk of the virus spreading.

Iran’s government ordered the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and stadiums among other public spaces in March in order to halt the spread of the virus.

But it has allowed a phased reopening of shops and has lifted restrictions on movement within the country since April 11.

The perennially cool defense minister continues to answer the news anchor’s questions, stopping only to kiss or caress the young interloper.

Bennett was discussing Israel’s exit strategy from the coronavirus lockdown in an interview from his home Saturday night when his son sauntered into the frame, apparently seeking some TLC from his famous dad.

﻿

The news anchor asks Bennett, who is the head of the right-wing Yamina party, whether the newly formed unity government between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and erstwhile rival Blue and White chief Benny Gantz was throwing Bennett’s own party to the curb during coalition negotiations.

Bennett embraces his son, David, but seems unperturbed by either the question nor his son’s sudden presence.

“I came to [politics] to make a difference,” Bennett said.

“I could have stayed in hitech and made millions, or been with my family,” the former entrepreneur said, and kissed his son on the forehead to drive the point home.

The anchor concluded the interview by thanking Bennett and telling him to “go and make an omelette for your son.”

Commenting about the article on Twitter, international human rights lawyer and pro-Israel activist Arsen Ostrovsky described the interview as “beautiful.”

['Breitbart Jerusalem'],2020-04-27,Saudi Arabia Ends Capital Punishment for Crimes Committed by Children,"(UPI) — Saudi Arabia will no longer execute individuals convicted of crimes committed when they were minors, the U.N. Human Rights Commission said.

Citing a royal decree signed by King Salman, Human Rights Commission President Awwad Alawwad announced the decision Sunday, saying it will help modernize the Middle Eastern country’s penal code.

“The decree means that any individuals who received a death sentence for crimes committed while he or she is a minor can no longer face execution,” Alawwad said in a statement. “Instead, the individuals will receive a prison sentence of no longer than 10 years in a juvenile detention facility.”

Such use of capital punishment is against the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Saudi Arabia has ratified.

The decree was announced nearly a week after Amnesty International released its 2019 global review of the death penalty detailing that Saudi Arabia executed 184 people last year, putting the Kingdom among the top five countries that administer executions as punishment.

Published Tuesday, the report said the majority of Saudi Arabia’s executions were for drug and murder convictions, though the international human rights organization said it had documented an increase of the punishment being used against religious minority dissidents.

It was unclear when the decree was issued or when it would be in effect but it was announced days after Saudi Arabia ended flogging as punishment in disciplinary cases.

Alawwad said the two decisions are examples of how Saudi Arabia is reforming its human rights record and reflects the Kingdom’s commitment to Prince Mohammed bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz’s Vision 2030 plan that aims to reduce the country’s economic dependence on oil. The plan calls for several progressive social reforms, including increasing the presence of women in the workplace.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-02,Report: China May Lose $200 Billion in Belt and Road Africa Wing,"China could lose about $200 billion from poor infrastructure investments in Africa amid the economic downturn caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei reported on Friday.

Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China promotes economically predatory infrastructure projects in developing nations to broaden its influence. In Africa, many expect China’s BRI investments to turn belly up amid the emerging economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, global supply and demand chains have been significantly disrupted as most countries around the world have essentially shut down their economies to comply with government-mandated lockdowns meant to curb the spread of the virus.

Demand for one of China’s main African investments, oil, has dropped drastically in recent weeks due to the coronavirus disruption, with the price of oil going negative for the first time ever. As individuals and big businesses are forced to halt activities, less fuel is used for both personal transportation and large cargo vehicles alike.

Africa — an impoverished continent facing some of the worst economic prospects in the world post-coronavirus pandemic, according to financial experts — will almost certainly see its nations default on their burdensome BRI loans.

China’s economic output fell 6.8 percent in the first quarter of this year, the Nikkei reports, adding that it seems doubtful that Beijing will have sufficient resources to fund African BRI projects in the future. As evidence, the report cites the absence of references in the communiques of recent political bureau meetings of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to BRI as a priority.

China views Africa mainly as a source of natural resources for the country’s growing demand in recent years. Beijing buys raw materials — such as oil, minerals, and metals — from Africa. China imports crude petroleum from Angola, Nigeria, South Sudan, and the Republic of Congo. In addition, China imports several minerals and metals from Africa, including iron and titanium from Sierra Leone; zinc and copper ore from Eritrea; and cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

China has committed nearly $200 billion in bilateral loans and FDI (foreign direct investment) in Africa through its BRI projects, according to the Nikkei.

It is likely that China could have paid the same — or less — for the raw materials, like oil and metals, it procures from Africa had it chosen to purchase them on the open market, the Nikkei article argued. According to the article, Beijing has invested in Africa hoping that more direct control of resources would provide greater security, but this has proven to be largely untrue, especially on a continent as insecure and volatile as Africa.

China’s own citizens have denounced the country’s BRI investments in Africa. In the fall of 2018, as dozens of African leaders prepared to fly to Beijing for a BRI summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, domestic criticism of the BRI projects in Africa made international headlines.

“Why is China, a country with over 100 million people who are still living below the poverty line, playing at being the flashy big-spender?” wrote Xu Zhangrun, an influential Tsinghua University law professor, in a critique of Xi in July 2018, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.

Another critic of China’s investment in Africa, Sun Wenguang, was arrested live on air by Chinese police as he voiced his concerns over China’s BRI projects during a Voice of America (VOA) radio show in August 2018. Sun, a retired university professor, criticized Xi’s spending in Africa on his show and argued that China was overlooking the poverty suffered by its own people.

As the police ripped him off-air, Sun could be heard saying, “Listen to what I say, is it wrong?”

“Regular people are poor, let’s not throw our money away in Africa … throwing money around like this doesn’t do any good for our country or our society,” Sun argued.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/05/02/report-china-may-lose-200-billion-in-belt-and-road-africa-wing/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-01,Experts: West African Child Labor May Spike Due to Coronavirus,"Experts warn that coronavirus-related school closures in West Africa during the local cocoa harvest season could cause a spike in child labor in Ivory Coast and Ghana, Reuters reported on Thursday.

The two West African nations produce a combined 65 percent of the world’s cocoa supply, according to the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB). Child labor has long been an issue in West African cocoa production, despite pledges from major chocolate companies that use the local cocoa, such as Nestle and Hershey, to reduce the exploitation, Reuters noted.

Currently, over two million children work in the cocoa sector in Ghana and Ivory Coast, a spike from a decade again, reported Reuters, citing a draft of a U.S. government-sponsored report seen by the news agency this month. Both Ghana and Ivory Coast prohibit child labor by law, but the laws are loosely enforced. In Ghana, the minimum age for work is 15 years old, while in Ivory Coast the minimum age is 14 years old. West Africa is currently in its mid-season cocoa harvesting period, according to Reuters.

Fairtrade Africa, a non-profit organization representing all Fairtrade certified producers in Africa, said it had received reports of possible cases of child labor in Ivory Coast’s eastern and western regions in recent weeks and has flagged them to the government.

“In normal circumstances, children are already vulnerable, and now they are not going to school [due to coronavirus shutdowns],” Anne-Marie Yao, regional cocoa manager for Fairtrade Africa, told Reuters.

The coronavirus pandemic has prevented Fairtrade Africa from having staff on the ground in West Africa upon whom they normally rely for information about child labor violations, Yao said. In addition, local shelters where rescued children are normally taken have closed due to coronavirus lockdowns.

“If the current situation continues an increase in child labor is very likely,” Nick Weatherill, executive director of the International Cocoa Initiative, a Swiss-based foundation working to eradicate child labor, told Reuters. Economic losses due to the coronavirus pandemic will also be a risk factor forcing children to work, Weatherill added.

According to Yao, school teachers are often the first to notice and report child abuse in West Africa. Yao suggested that Ghana and Ivory state governments could instruct public school teachers to somehow stay in touch with their students to maintain this line of communication despite school closures.

Last week, Ivory Coast’s national anti-trafficking committee released a statement reminding parents that child labor is punishable by law, Reuters reported. “The harvest season and the closing of schools must not be an excuse for violating children’s rights,” said Ivory Coast’s First Lady Dominique Ouattara, who heads the anti-trafficking committee.

On March 24, Ivory Coast declared a state of emergency as part of its response to the coronavirus pandemic. The act called for “gradual confinement measures” restricting people’s movement in an effort to curb virus transmission. Ghana recently eased a three-week lockdown in certain parts of the country to slow the spread of coronavirus.

On Thursday, the Associated Press (AP) reported a spike in Ghana’s coronavirus cases just ten days after the lockdown was lifted. The number of infections surged to over 2,000 on Thursday, a 24 percent increase over a matter of days, according to AP.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-05-01,Tanzania Arrests Lawyer for Saying Coronavirus a ‘Real Threat’,"Police arrested a prominent lawyer in Tanzania on Wednesday for saying the Chinese coronavirus was “serious” and “a real threat,” Tanzanian newspaper The Citizen reported.

Arusha Regional Police Commander Koka Moita confirmed to The Citizen that Albert Msando was being detained at the Arusha Central police station on Wednesday night.

Moita said Msando “was being interrogated over statements he made regarding Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus],” but did not elaborate, according to the newspaper. The Citizen quoted a source who said Msando drove himself to the police station that evening after receiving a summons from authorities.

According to the newspaper, Msando’s arrest followed shortly after Arusha Regional Commissioner Mrisho Gambo ordered the police to arrest any person communicating “conflicting public information on coronavirus,” presumably information which conflicts with the official government statements on the matter.

On Tuesday, Msando said the coronavirus pandemic was serious and a real threat in Arusha, and that the city was reeling from the pandemic. He urged journalists to report truthfully on what was happening regarding the city’s coronavirus outbreak so that proper preventive measures could be taken by the public, The Citizen reported.

These comments were made after Msando handed out masks and hand sanitizer to Arusha journalists so that they could protect themselves from the virus, the newspaper added.

News of Msando’s detention comes on the same day Tanzanian President John Magufuli was criticized most recently for failing to take the threat of the coronavirus pandemic seriously. On Wednesday, Tanzania’s main political opposition said the president was in a “state of denial” about the worsening situation in Tanzania regarding the coronavirus, where the number of cases has surged dramatically over the past few weeks, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).

On March 16, Tanzania recorded its first case of coronavirus. In a little over two weeks, the number of cases has surged from 32 to 480 at press time on Thursday, with 16 deaths.

Tanzania remains one of the few African countries not taking extensive measures against the coronavirus pandemic yet. Schools and universities in the country have closed but markets, public transportation, and shops remain open.

Freeman Mbowe, of the opposition Chadema party, accused the government of hiding information about the coronavirus in a speech broadcast online on Wednesday, AFP reported.

“We see people dying and their burials are supervised by the government under strict conditions but yet it is not telling us they died of coronavirus. There is no transparency and when people have no information, you provide room for rumors. The government is telling us only 16 [people] died of coronavirus but this is a joke,” he said. The president was in a “state of denial,” Mbowe added.

Last month, Magufuli claimed God would protect Tanzanians from the coronavirus, not facemasks. He has urged people to keep going about their routines as usual. “This is time to build our faith and continue praying to God and not depending on facemasks. Don’t stop going to churches and mosques for prayers. I’m sure this is just a change of wind and it will go like others have gone,” Magufuli said at a church in Dodoma in March.

['Frances Martel'],2020-04-30,South Africa's Health Workers Protest Imported Cuban Slave Doctors,"Doctors and nurses in South Africa protested the arrival of over 200 Cuban slave doctors to the country this week after reports surfaced indicating the country would have to pay the Communist regime far more than it would have if it had just hired local doctors.

South Africa’s government argued that importing Cuban slave doctors was necessary to fight the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Reports indicate Cuba makes as much as $11 billion a year sending its doctors worldwide and pays them a tiny portion of those proceeds, only a living “stipend” to prevent them from becoming homeless or starving. The Organization of American States (OAS) has referred to the Cuban slave doctor program as “human trafficking.”

South Africa’s New24 documented the arrival of 217 Cuban slave doctors to Waterkloof airforce base in South Africa on Monday, identifying them as “family physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, healthcare technology engineers, biotechnology experts, and other specialists.”

Cuban Health Specialists arrive in South Africa to support efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. pic.twitter.com/jxPVIHI0VJ — Department of Health: COVID-19 (@COVID_19_ZA) April 26, 2020

“We ask[ed] the government of Cuba and the people of Cuba to send a multidisciplinary team of experts and health professionals. These men and women are to work alongside South African health professionals in our response to Covid-19 [the Chinese coronavirus disease],” South Africa’s International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor reportedly said upon their arrival. “Cuba has once again proven the character of its nation through its act of international human solidarity.”

The Cuban communist regime enjoys an outsized positive reputation in South Africa due to dictator Fidel Castro’s longstanding support for Nelson Mandela, particularly prior to his release and ascent to leading the country out of the Apartheid era.

South African journalists have published several reports estimating the price of this “human solidarity.” The online newspaper Daily Maverick reported on Thursday that documents believed to be from the South African government suggest that the price of the hundreds of doctors is at least 439,916,337 rand (nearly $24 million), though that price is based on a smaller number of doctors that those who actually arrived. The outlet noted that “both the Treasury and the Department of Health failed to respond to repeated requests for comment on the matter from Daily Maverick and other media outlets – which in itself may be revealing.”

Business Day, another South African newspaper, appears to be the origin of the documents in question. South Africa’s The Times estimated that, if accurate, the price for the total service means that it costs about 2.35 million rand ($127,624.79) per Cuban doctor, far more than the regular salary for a South African doctor.

News24 confirmed the veracity of the document showing that price. The outlet reported the doctors would not be able to work for a 14-day period in which they will be held in quarantine. It is not clear if Cuba is being paid for services that would otherwise have been rendered during those two weeks.

The South African Medical Association (SAMA) told Business Day that “a public sector registrar or mid-level medical officer, comparable to a Cuban family physician, commands a salary of about R1.2m [$65,170.10] a year.”

“Retired doctors can be brought back into the service delivery system – even for a short time. They can also mentor younger doctors who lack the necessary experience and skills,” Dr. Angeline Coetzee, the chairwoman of SAMA, said in response to the imported doctors. “Only when we have exhausted all our internal human resources should a consultative process between SAMA, the Department of Health, and the Presidency been initiated to bring the Cuban specialists to South Africa.”

“While we are not averse to the so-called Cuban Brigade assisting us, we feel strongly that the principle of not engaging with SAMA – as the biggest representative body of doctors in the country – is flawed and wrong,” Coetzee added.

The organization said in another statement that neglecting the employment needs of local doctors was a mistake.

“There are many unemployed doctors in South Africa and many community service medical officers have still not been placed. In addition, many private practitioners have indicated their willingness to assist,” SAMA asserted.

The Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa (Hospersa), through a spokesperson, also described the influx of slave doctors as a “bitter pill to swallow” for unemployed South African health workers.

“It is quite a depressing situation where government goes ahead and takes decisions like this, especially in a country like ours where we know that there are quite a lot of unemployed health professionals sitting at home,” spokesman Kevin Halama said, according to News24.

The outlet also noted that Denosa, a South African nurses’ union, called the move “unpatriotic,” and the South African Internationally Trained Health Professionals Association (SAITHPA) protested that it is much easier for a Cuban national to receive approval to practice medicine in the country than for a South African.

“Their [the domestic health workers’] bewilderment and disappointment in relation to the disregard shown by the HPCSA [health authorities] to them is now further enhanced by the recent importation of medical personnel from Cuba, as these unemployed medical graduates wonder why R440-million of money from their taxpaying parents has been used to import doctors whilst they remain unemployed and willing to serve through the necessary channels,” SAITHPA said in a statement.

South Africa’s Health department protested that it was “not fair” for anyone to question the price of the Cuban doctors.

South Africa’s medical professionals join those in several other African countries, including Uganda and Kenya, who have objected to being displaced by Cuban slaves. All have protested that their national organizations were not included in decisions on importing the doctors and some countries have had to develop programs in which their local doctors “mentor” the Cubans, as the Castro regime did not provide them sufficient medical training to allow them safe access to patients alone.

Cuban doctors who have escaped the system say they are barely paid enough to eat and that most of their work consists of falsifying medical records to appear more productive than they actually are. At a press conference in Washington last year, one Cuban doctor who served in Bolivia said she was forced to “see” non-existent patients and “prescribe” them medicine. The doctors then destroyed the medicine to claim they had successfully treated the “patient.”

“They tell us often in Cuba that education is free, therefore we are their property,” Tatiana Carballo, one of the doctors, said at the time. “From the moment we graduate, we receive very, very low salaries, then begin medical missions abroad.”

['Ben Kew'],2020-04-29,Madagascar Forces Coronavirus Mask Violators to Clean Streets,"Police in Antananarivo, Madagascar, on Monday introduced a somewhat unconventional punishment against citizens caught not wearing masks in public, forcing violators to clean the city’s streets.

The new rule came into effect this week after President Andry Rajoelina announced the compulsory wearing of sanitary masks outdoors in public as a condition for the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions across the country’s major cities imposed in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Originally, authorities had warned citizens caught ignoring the rules that they would face community service. They may not have anticipated that the service would involve sweeping the capital’s streets and picking up trash.

“From Monday, April 20th, people going out of their homes will be required to wear masks. A free distribution is planned from April 20th to 26th, in the towns that have registered contact cases (Antananarivo, Toamasina and Fianarantsoa),” reads guidance on the country’s tourist site. “Starting from Monday, April 27, anyone not wearing a mask will be required to perform community service (cleaning of gardens, schools, or streets).”

In an interview with local television, the leader of the coronavirus response operations General Elak Olivier Andriakaja said that the punishment was fair because citizens had been made aware of the new rules through an awareness campaign. He added that around 70 percent of people were obeying the rule.

General Elak Olivier Andriakaja, leader of the anti-coronavirus operations, told state television that most people were respecting the rules.

“Seventy percent of people on the street respected the rule … because they are scared of having to sweep pavements,” he said. “Measures were taken before the sanctions fell into place to raise awareness and distribute mouth covers. I think that’s enough and that sanctions must now be applied.”

Police deputy head Christian Rakotobe told AFP that around 500 people were penalized on Monday alone for violating the rules, 25 of whom were forced to start cleaning the streets immediately.

Among the other somewhat bizarre guidance on the country’s tourism website, the government also boasted of a new herbal remedy “based on a medicinal plant called artemisia which has curative and preventive virtues to fight coronavirus symptoms.” According to researchers, there is currently no scientifically proven treatment for the virus.

As of Wednesday, the island of 26.26 million people has reported only 128 cases of the Chinese coronavirus. Of the infected, 90 patients have already recovered and no fatalities have been recorded.

Madagascar is not the only nation to introduce unusual punishments for those disobeying lockdown measures. Last week, officials in Indonesia’s Central Java began forcing quarantine violators to stay in a haunted house in isolation.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-29,South Africa: Criminals Stash Drugs in Coffins During Lockdown,"A province in South Africa has identified a “new trend” in which criminals use coffins and hearses to transport illegal drugs during the nation’s coronavirus lockdown, South Africa’s News24 reported.

On March 27, South Africa’s government initiated a nationwide lockdown in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus. During the shutdown, due to last until the end of April, travel is allowed only for essential services and social distancing is enforced. South Africa’s coronavirus lockdown has been considered one of the strictest on the African continent, and it includes a ban on alcohol sales.

Faced with the alcohol sale ban and travel restrictions, criminals have devised creative ways to traffic illegal provisions. News24 reports that in KwaZulu-Natal, a coastal province, criminals have been impersonating funeral home staff – who have fewer lockdown restrictions as they are considered essential workers – to hide and transport drugs.

On April 25, in the town of Underberg, police officers noticed a vehicle belonging to a funeral parlor. The officers stopped and searched the car, and discovered liquor inside the vehicle. The car’s occupants were then arrested.

Earlier the same day, in the town of Pongola, two alleged drug dealers were arrested after they were caught in possession of 176 pounds of marijuana stashed in a coffin they were transporting. The individuals were posing as funeral home employees when they were stopped by police officers manning a roadblock, searched, and arrested.

“We welcome the significant progress made by our law enforcement authorities in the apprehension of those who have sought to violate the regulations of the lockdown,” Sihle Zikalala, KwaZulu-Natal’s premier said at a press conference on Sunday, News24 reports. “We want to commend the law enforcement operations for upscaling efforts to ensure compliance with lockdown regulations,” he added.

Zikala also described the drug traffickers impersonating funeral home staff as a “new trend” in his province.

On April 20, several South African policemen were arrested for drinking at a bar, which violated the nation’s ban on alcohol sales during the coronavirus lockdown.

On April 23, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the government will allow a partial reopening of the economy on May 1, easing travel restrictions and allowing some industries to resume operations. At press time on Tuesday, South Africa had 4,996 infections and 93 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/29/south-africa-criminals-stash-drugs-in-coffins-during-coronavirus-lockdown/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-29,"Report: Uganda Raids LGBT Shelter, Claiming Coronavirus Violations","Local authorities in Uganda are facing accusations of raiding an LGBT shelter based on the perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of the residents, then charging them for allegedly defying coronavirus regulations on physical distancing, AllAfrica reported on Monday.

The incident reportedly occurred in Kyengera, a town in central Uganda, on March 29.

“We are deeply concerned about a raid on an LGBT shelter in Kyengera on March 29 and the arrest and detention of 19 people perceived to be LGBT persons,” the United Nations (U.N.) said in a statement released on Monday.

“[U.N.] experts are alarmed that Uganda could be using COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] emergency laws to target gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender [LGBT] people, and urged the government to strictly limit the use of emergency power to public health issues,” the statement said.

The U.N. also expressed concern that the detainees in this case allegedly have no access to their lawyer due to unspecified coronavirus measures.

“The right to access to legal assistance is a fundamental human right afforded to everyone,” the statement pointed out. The U.N. asked Uganda to include the Kyengera detainees in a planned future release of 2,000 inmates in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus in prisons.

On April 6, the Uganda Prisons Service listed 2,000 prisoners who have served part of their sentences across the country to be released if Uganda’s Attorney General approves the proposal. The prisoner release has been framed as one way to decongest prisons and reduce the spread of coronavirus within the facilities, according to a report on April 7 by Ugandan newspaper the Daily Monitor.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/29/report-uganda-raids-lgbt-shelter-claiming-coronavirus-violations/
['Frances Martel'],2020-04-28,Lawsuit Demands China Pay $200 Billion to Nigeria in Damages,"A group of Nigerian attorneys announced this week they would file a lawsuit against the government of China, seeking $200 billion in damages for its role in exacerbating the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

According to Nigeria’s the Guardian, the law firm Azinge and Azinge is seeking to pressure the government of Nigeria to press charges against the Chinese Communist Party at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at the Hague, as well, to overcome the obstacle of sovereign immunity. Only states, not individuals, can bring matters before the ICJ.

Azinge and Azinge, the law firm organizing the legal action, said in a statement their astronomical estimate of redress for the Nigerian people over the pandemic takes into account “loss of lives, economic strangulation, trauma, hardship, social disorientation, mental torture and disruption of normal daily existence of people in Nigeria.”

“The team of legal experts planned a two-phase line of action: first is with the federal high court of Nigeria and secondly to persuade the government of Federal Republic of Nigeria to institute a state action against the Peoples Republic of China at the International Court of Justice at the Hague,” Epiphany Azinge, one of the lawyers organizing the lawsuit, told reporters this week. “The legal experts will be claiming damages to the tune of 200 billion dollars the Chinese Government will be served through its Embassy in Nigeria.”

Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and its largest oil exporter, suffering prodigious economic damage with the collapse in global oil prices that the pandemic has caused.

At press time, Nigeria has documented 1,337 cases of Chinese coronavirus nationwide and 40 deaths. These numbers are likely significantly deflated, however, given the sparse healthcare infrastructure in much of the country, particularly the poorer northeast. The number also does not include dozens of individuals who have died in rural areas inexplicably of a “strange ailment” but never had the opportunity to test for Chinese coronavirus.

In addition to suffering the medical repercussions of the Chinese virus, Nigerians in China have been the victims of widespread racism. In Guangzhou, a southern Chinese city with one of the largest populations of black people nationwide, Nigerians and other Africans and black people have reported being expelled from their homes despite paying rent and banned from businesses like hotels and restaurants, being forced to sleep on the street while being able to afford shelter. Some have protested that Chinese authorities force them into “quarantine” even after testing negative for Chinese coronavirus repeatedly, while they see non-black foreigners moving about freely.

The Chinese Communist Party has falsely insisted that its current cases of Chinese coronavirus all originated from foreigners, fueling racism. China also claims that the verdict is still out on where the virus originated, despite all the earliest cases of confirmed Chinese coronavirus infection occurred in the central city of Wuhan. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman posited instead that the virus was created in a U.S. Army laboratory, citing no evidence.

American officials are formally investigating the possibility that the Wuhan Institute of Virology played a role in the pandemic, Breitbart News confirmed this week.

The Nigerian government typically enjoys warm relations with China, participating in the nation’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI is a scheme in which China lends developing countries, many of them in Africa, large loans at predatory interest rates to build upscale transportation projects. China then floods the project with Chinese migrant workers, who are paid with the loan money, thus returning it to China. President Muhammadu Buhari also regularly sends warm greetings to China.

Following initial reports of racist acts against black people in Guangzhou, Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama offered a lukewarm statement opposing bigotry. After a continent-wide outcry against China, however, Onyeama issued a much more impassioned statement last week in which he raised the possibility of assessing legal damages caused by behavior the Chinese government allowed against Nigerians.

“We are deeply wounded by what is happening to Nigerians and other Africans living in China, it is something we never expected and we will pursue it,” Onyeama said. “We’ve made it clear to the Chinese government in no uncertain terms, unequivocally, that under no circumstances we will accept racial discrimination against Nigerians and the Africans or blacks in China. That that is a red line for us.”

“I have directed the [Nigerian] consulate in Guangzhou to systematically detail every single case of discrimination and every single case of loss or damage suffered by any Nigerian,” he added. “We will pursue every single one very robustly with the Chinese government if it requires compensation and damages.”

Nigeria joins Italy, Egypt, and two U.S. states – Missouri and Mississippi – in accepting lawsuits against the government of China for its role in the pandemic. China has largely responded to the American lawsuits with insults and threats.

“The US has in the past acted as a hooligan in the political and public opinion spheres, and the hooliganism has now expanded into the judicial realm. Hooligans are cheats who willingly break the rules when they can’t win. The US acts are a good example of this,” the Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, asserted last week.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-28,Nigeria: Boko Haram Makes Millions Selling Smoked Fish and Red Pepper,"Jihadist terrorist group Boko Haram in 2009 kicked off an insurgency in Nigeria that spilled into neighboring countries to the east and persists to this day.

According to an analysis published by Nigerian newspaper Premium Times on Sunday, two of the major economic activities disrupted by the insurgency – commercial fishing and farming of red pepper – have been co-opted by Boko Haram in recent years and used to fuel its current resurgence in the vast Lake Chad region linking Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon.

Fish and red pepper were central trading products in the Lake Chad Basin economy before the crisis, and many area communities depended upon them as both a source of food and revenue. Prior to Boko Haram’s rise, the combined fish and red pepper trades contributed $48 million to Nigeria’s economy, and employed over 300,000 people according to the World Food Program, the report said.

In 2015, the terrorists began to strategically reorganize the trade of both products. They encouraged fishing by the banks of Lake Chad among local communities and created a new economic structure of taxes, fees, and paid protection for traders along secure routes to reach designated markets, according to the report.

Boko Haram’s leadership sent recruiters to internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Nigeria’s Borno State, requesting the very people they had displaced to return to fishing, farming, and trading, but now under their terms, reported the Premium Times. Several hundred families agreed to resume farming and fishing activities in and around Lake Chad, eager to escape the camps’ desperate and inhumane living conditions.

Borno state, in northeastern Nigeria, was one of the Lake Chad communities most dependent on commercial fishing and red pepper farming prior to the terrorists’ jihadist campaign, according to the analysis, and was also the site where Boko Haram caused the most conflict.

Lake Chad’s aquatic life and natural resources replenished in the years following the insurgency and subsequent halting of fishing and farming in the area. According to the report, Boko Haram capitalized on this new abundance when recruiting fishermen and farmers from the camps. The jihadist terrorists described the bountiful aquatic life in Lake Chad as a strong indication that Allah was pleased with the war they had been waging and was rewarding them with the “symbolic manna from heaven,” says Premium Times.

In reality, some contend the renewal of aquatic resources in Lake Chad was the result of the drastic reduction of human activity in the region due to population displacement caused by the insurgency.

According to the report, once the area’s agriculture was re-established, Boko Haram began to charge farmers and fishermen a significant tax for their products. It also forced farmers to pay for security provided by Boko Haram on specially designated routes when transporting their goods to markets.

“Most of the revenue from fish is shared between the military that confiscates the goods and the terrorists that charge levies for these items,” said a Borno State government official speaking to the Premium Times on condition of anonymity.

Often, farmers and fisherman pay their taxes to the terrorists not in cash but in the form of essential commodities like gasoline, prescription drugs, mobile phones, cooking stoves, and spices according to the report.

The Premium Times argued that Nigerian government officials allow Boko Haram to continue the illegal fish and red pepper trade in the country unbothered, while Chadian forces have attempted to curtail the operations in their regions.

In recent months, Boko Haram has increased its attacks in the Lake Chad area, taking advantage of lockdowns caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic to stage a resurgence. Last month, the terrorist group carried out two of its most significant attacks to date; since then, it has continued to attack communities left vulnerable due to coronavirus lockdowns in the area, which restrict people’s movement.

Boko Haram massacred at least 92 Chadian soldiers on March 22 when it attacked an army base on Boma Peninsula along the border with Nigeria and Niger. It was the single deadliest attack on Chad’s military forces. The next day, Boko Haram reportedly wiped out an entire Nigerian artillery unit. The militants ambushed and killed at least 50 Nigerian soldiers near northern Nigeria’s Yobe state, in one of the deadliest assaults on Nigerian troops.

Since 2009, Boko Haram has killed roughly 36,000 people and displaced about two million people in northeastern Nigeria, according to United Nations estimates. As seen with the attacks in March, regional authorities have largely failed to combat the jihadist insurgency. Several nations united to create the Multinational Joint Force in 2015, in an attempt to counter jihadist activity in the Lake Chad area.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/28/nigeria-boko-haram-makes-millions-selling-smoked-fish-and-red-pepper/
['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-25,Lebanon Arrests Suspect for Putting Nigerian Worker Up ‘For Sale’ Online,"Lebanese security forces arrested a man on Thursday on suspicion of putting a Nigerian domestic worker up “for sale” online, Al Jazeera reported.

The man placed the advertisement on a Facebook page popular in Lebanon for the casual trade of items such as furniture, food, and shoes.

“Domestic worker of African citizenship (Nigerian) for sale with a new residency and full legal papers,” a Facebook account under the name Wael Jerro posted on a page entitled “Buy and Sell in Lebanon.” Authorities remain unsure of the post’s exact date.

On Thursday, members of Lebanon’s General Security, the country’s leading intelligence agency that controls entry and exit from the Mediterranean country, arrested a suspect. The agency told Al Jazeera on Thursday that an investigation into the incident is currently underway.

On Wednesday, Lebanon’s Justice Minister Marie-Claude Najem had ordered the judiciary to follow up on the case, citing Lebanon’s anti-human trafficking law, according to Al Jazeera. Lebanon’s Ministry of Labor also released a statement saying anyone who advertises domestic workers online would be prosecuted. In her statement on Wednesday, Najem said the case represented a “blatant violation of human dignity.”

Al Jazeera said Nigerian officials have requested that Lebanese authorities investigate the incident.

Approximately 250,000 migrant domestic workers live and work in Lebanon, according to Al Jazeera. Most are from sub-Saharan African countries such as Ethiopia and Ghana, as well as Asian nations like Nepal and the Philippines.

In Lebanon, the country’s kafala system requires workers to obtain their employer’s permission to end a job contract, Al Jazeera reports. The system, which also ties workers’ legal residency to their employers, has led to widespread abuse, including wage withholding, and physical and sexual assault.

Camille Abousleiman, Lebanon’s former labor minister, has called kafala “modern-day slavery.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/04/25/lebanon-arrests-suspect-for-putting-nigerian-worker-up-for-sale-online/
['Ben Kew'],2020-04-24,Cameroon: Police Clash with Muslims Refusing to Cancel Ramadan Gatherings,"Police in Cameroon clashed with Muslims on Friday after they refused to adhere to lockdown measures in response to the Chinese coronavirus to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan, Voice of America (VOA) reports.

In a statement, police said they were forced to disperse Muslims gathering in 13 mosques in the country’s West, Center, and Far North regions, attending Friday prayers to begin the Ramadan fasting period.

Gatherings of more than 50 people are banned under measures imposed by the government this month aimed at containing the spread of the virus. Anyone venturing outside must wear protective face masks. Those not following the rules are subject to fines and sanctions.

Awah Fonka, governor of the western region of Cameroon, said he asked security forces to forcibly remove those ignoring government orders and “not spare anyone” who continues to disobey. According to police, some in the crowd were actively targeting people in some of Cameroon’s hardest-hit towns and villages, with some 175 people complaining that they were targeted or chased from their villages.

Police in Cameroon are not the only authorities struggling to keep some Muslims from practicing their faith at this important time in the Islamic calendar. Most imams have asked people to stay indoors, yet some hardliners have urged their followers to ignore lockdown measures in order to prioritize the observation of Ramadan and other religious practices.

Ramadan, which began on Thursday, requires Muslims to fast and pray at mosques during the daylight hours before holding feasts with family and friends at sundown. The large crowds that ensue create ripe conditions for the virus to spread, and so most governments have ordered people to stay home.

Elsewhere in Africa, Islamist terror organization Boko Haram has taken advantage of the lockdowns by increasing attacks across territories in both Cameroon and Nigeria. This month, the organization killed at least ten people in a suicide bombing in Blama Kamsoulou, a northern village of Cameroon close to the country’s border with Nigeria.

Cameroon remains the West African country hardest hit by the ongoing pandemic, reporting 1,430 cases nationwide and 43 deaths. At least 668 people have already made a full recovery.

['John Hayward'],2020-04-24,Tanzania: President Calls for African Debt Forgiveness After Coronavirus,"President of Tanzania John Magufuli on Wednesday called for international lenders, particularly the World Bank, to forgive existing African loans instead of offering new loans to help rebuild the continent’s economies after the Wuhan virus pandemic.

“African countries’ economic capacity is not the same as that of developed countries. Instead of offering more loans to fight corona, they should forgive debts,” Magufuli said in a televised address to his defense and security chiefs.

Magufuli expressed appreciation for the World Bank’s offer of fast-track financing, but argued that debt forgiveness would be more helpful than asking impoverished nations that suffered economic damage from the coronavirus to take on even more debt, no matter how attractive the terms. He noted that Tanzania spends over $300 million in U.S. dollars on debt repayment and about half of it goes to the World Bank.

“Since the World Bank has shown its concern and willingness to help us out of this pandemic, allow me to request that that help should come in the form of a relief on repayment of existing debts, or at least its interest,” he said.

“I would request, fellow African countries, that our rich brothers should consider a debt relief for us instead of getting us into a new burden of loans for which they will demand interest,” he continued. “It would make economic sense if the loan was reflected in debt relief. That, I think, would be a good gesture for these financial institutions toward poor countries.”

Magufuli also criticized what he saw as fearmongering and political opportunism over the coronavirus and resisted calls to impose a lockdown, instead recommending simple social distancing techniques and local herbal remedies. He described these herbal treatments, including onions, as “important and scientific.”

“Not everyone who gets the coronavirus dies,” he said. “Not everyone who dies, dies of Covid-19. We should fight fear, which is itself a more dangerous thing than Covid-19.”

Tanzania’s official coronavirus count stood on Friday at 284 cases and ten deaths, most of them in the commercial hub of Dar es Salaam. Magufuli said Tanzania cannot afford the economic damage from a quarantine.

“There are calls to lock down Dar es Salaam. We will never do that. This is our main port city and accounts for around 80 percent of government revenue,” he said on Wednesday.

The health and economy of Africa are major concerns for international organizations from the United Nations to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the World Bank, but the latter has been lukewarm at best on Tanzania’s coronavirus program.

AFP noted this week that a spate of stories has appeared in Tanzanian and African media claiming the World Bank praised Magufuli’s administration for its handling of the pandemic, but none of that praise actually appears in any official World Bank document.

The World Bank felt it necessary to release a statement denying that it has offered any “specific mention or assessment of Tanzania’s Covid-19 response.” Instead, the bank’s analysis recommends African nations should “customise their Covid-19 responses to fit the structural features of their economies.”

The World Bank has predicted the coronavirus will knock sub-Saharan Africa from a projected 2.8 percent growth rate for 2020 into an outright recession of between two and five percent, exacerbated by the effect of cratering prices on economies that depend upon oil revenue. Also, the worldwide loss of production and demand for products such as automobiles has reduced demand for the metals sold by African nations.

Of course, persuading lenders to underwrite even low-interest loans with very protracted repayment terms is very different from persuading them to take billions of dollars in losses by writing off existing loans.

African officials told the G-20 meeting in mid-April that short-term debt relief offered by their creditors was not enough to help them through the coronavirus crisis. African Union envoy Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said at least a “two-year time scale” was needed for a moratorium on African debt payments to “give African countries the breathing room to be able to deal with the enormous consequences of the pandemic.”

At least one European official, French President Emmanuel Macron, has called for “massively canceling” some of Africa’s debt. On the other hand, China has been noticeably quiet about the prospect of canceling any of its massive debts in Africa.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/04/24/tanzania-president-calls-african-debt-forgiveness-after-coronavirus/
['Frances Martel'],2020-04-24,"Nigeria ‘Deeply Wounded,’ ‘Extremely Disappointed’ by Chinese Racism","Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, issued scathing remarks against the communist government of China on Thursday, announcing Nigerian diplomats in Guangzhou were instructed to document cases of racism by Chinese against their citizens.

For weeks, videos, local reports, and other evidence have indicated widespread racist attacks and policies by Chinese in Guangzhou, a southern port city that is home to many of China’s African residents. Africans and black people from other parts of the world in the city reported being forcibly evicted despite paying their rents and banned from businesses like hotels and restaurants.

In a particularly embarrassing incident for the American company, a McDonald’s in Guangzhou posted a sign stating it would not allow black-skinned people into the establishment, triggering “diversity and inclusion training” mandated by corporate officers.

Many Africans were reportedly forced to sleep on the streets of Guangzhou, despite having the money to pay for shelter, because no Chinese residence or hotel would take them.

The racism appears to be based on rumors circulated in party by the Communist Party that cases of Chinese coronavirus in its origin country are now coming from “foreigners.” Beijing calls cases of individuals diagnosed with Chinese coronavirus after entering the country from abroad “imported” cases and claims any threat to Chinese nationals comes from these, and not domestic, cases of the virus.

There is no evidence that African people are more likely to be carrying the virus and it is not clear why some in Guangzhou concluded that banning black people from their businesses would protect them from the Chinese coronavirus. Africa is among the continents with the lowest numbers of documented Chinese coronavirus cases.

“We are deeply wounded by what is happening to Nigerians and other Africans living in China, it is something we never expected and we will pursue it,” Onyeama told reporters in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, on Thursday.

“We have an engagement with the Chinese government at various levels. The level of our consulate in Guangzhou, which is where these cases of discrimination and racism have been taking place. and also at the federal level in China, in Beijing,” Onyeama explained, claiming that China was providing “medical assistance” for Nigerian Chinese coronavirus patients.

The foreign minister then appeared to accuse the Chinese government of lying about the racism in Guangzhou.

“We’ve made it clear to the Chinese government in no uncertain terms, unequivocally, that under no circumstances we will accept racial discrimination against Nigerians and the Africans or blacks in China,” Onyeama continued. “That that is a red line for us. They have, in turn, told us that there is no case of that … but clearly, you know, we are seeing videos, have received reports, and we told them it’s unacceptable.”

“I have directed the [Nigerian] consulate in Guangzhou to systematically detail every single case of discrimination and every single case of loss or damage suffered by any Nigerian,” Onyeama announced. “We will pursue every single one very robustly with the Chinese government if it requires compensation and damages.”

Onyeama proclaimed his government “extremely disappointed such a thing could happen.”

That is a red line for us because we showed China real solidarity in not placing a ban on China during the early outbreak of the pandemic in Wuhan. But of course, the Government of China has given us explanations that no such thing will occur any more. — Geoffrey Onyeama (@GeoffreyOnyeama) April 23, 2020

“As the World’s largest black nation, it behoves [sic] us to defend the dignity of blacks and Africans anywhere in the world,” Onyeama added on Twitter.

The foreign minister’s tone differed significantly from his remarks last week, when reports of Nigerians forced out into the street in the middle of a pandemic first surfaced. During a press conference on April 14, Onyeama criticized local Guangzhou officials, and not the Chinese government generally, for not discussing issues with Nigerians in the city with their government. Chinese state television interpreted his remarks as saying there was “no evidence of discrimination.”

In addition to being banned from restaurants for having darker skin than Chinese people, black people in Guangzhou reported government harassment, such as being forced to take many more coronavirus tests than non-black counterparts and being quarantined in their homes even after testing positive.

In a report published by BBC this week, one African in Guangzhou speaking anonymously documented his “arbitrary detention” at home, forced into quarantine despite having no known contact with any Chinese coronavirus patients and no evidence of infection.

“They have to stay here and they can’t stay in a hotel because the hotel doesn’t want them anymore. Some people are living in the streets,” an African man identified by the pseudonym “Leo” told Vice in a report published Friday. “Some people want to go to restaurants, but they can’t buy food because the restaurants tell them, ‘We’re not selling you food because you are Black..'”

Onyeama’s new comments may be a result of growing outrage in Africa at its governments for not doing enough to punish the Chinese government for allowing racist abuse.

“These are serious violations of rights which we, black people are not going to stand by and tolerate,” members of the Africa Diaspora Development Institute (ADDI) wrote in on open letter to dictator Xi Jinping published this week by Nigeria’s Guardian newspaper. “It is in the spirit of fairness and respect for human rights that we urge you in the strongest of terms, to put an immediate end to the harassment, intimidation, and inhumane treatment meted out to African brothers and sisters, sons, and daughters living in your country. The line has been crossed and enough is enough! We demand immediate reciprocity.”

Xi Jinping has made no public comments on the racism in his country.

In Kenya, columnist Makau Mutua wrote at the Daily Nation that his government “has been neutered by the Chinese.”

“The Chinese are bent on exploiting every last natural resource in Africa to feed their hungry and voracious industrial appetite,” Mutua wrote in an April 19 column. “The flip side is the Chinese penetration of the African import market with cheap, often substandard, goods.”

“But Kenyans have also flocked to China for higher education and to source cheap goods for import. While Kenyans in China navigate the country wearily, the Chinese in Kenya strut around the country like colossi, as though they own Kenya,” Mutua noted. “Three recent cases of Chinese racism and intolerable arrogance come to mind. In the first, a Chinese restaurant refused service to blacks. Kenya can’t allow itself to be recolonised. It must take bold steps to repudiate the actions of the Chinese.”

Mutua calls for Kenya to begin its condemnation by “publicly and loudly expelling a good number of Chinese citizens.”

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-24,Coronavirus Oil Price Collapse Threatens Vulnerable African Economies,"Many nations in Africa face potential devastation by the recent collapse of oil prices due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, and reports this week indicate the damage has already begun.

For the first quarter of 2020, trade between Africa and China fell by 14 percent to $41.23 billion, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday.

In the January-March period, China’s imports from Africa, mainly raw materials for industry, such as oil and metals, fell by 17.5 percent in the quarter to $19.8 billion, while Chinese exports to Africa dropped 10.5 percent to $21.4 billion compared to last year, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs.

Oil demand has dropped in recent months due to a disruption in global supply and demand chains caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Economies around the world have been severely hindered by government-mandated lockdowns, designed to slow the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. As nations force their citizens into house arrest and shut down businesses, citizens and large cargo vehicles use less fuel as they make fewer trips.

On Monday, oil prices went negative for the first time ever.

China is the world’s largest oil importer. Oil accounts for more than half of sub-Saharan Africa’s exports, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) reported on Wednesday. According to the Brookings Institute, most of the global poor live in sub-Saharan Africa, meaning countries in this region are uniquely burdened by the oil collapse.

Africa’s largest oil producer, Nigeria, relies upon the commodity almost entirely. In Nigeria, oil accounts for less than ten percent of GDP, but amounts to more than 90 percent of the country’s foreign exchange and can contribute as much as 70 percent of the country’s government revenue, according to CFR. Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy.

In recent years, other African countries besides Nigeria – such as Angola and the Republic of Congo – have entered the oil market, causing African governments to become exceedingly reliant upon oil revenue.

Nigeria and the Republic of Congo were among the African countries that reported a decrease in Chinese demand for oil this quarter, according to SCMP. In February, China canceled an oil shipment from Angola due to port closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, forcing the African nation to resell the oil at a discount, Capital Economics, an economic research consultancy, told SCMP.

The two-fold problem of having to respond to the coronavirus pandemic while simultaneously experiencing a severe loss in revenue will likely cripple African nations’ economies in the months and years to come, CFR said. Africa must cope with the healthcare costs of responding to the coronavirus pandemic and also to the humanitarian costs, such as feeding its already starving population. Famine poses a serious threat to Africa in the coming months as the coronavirus pandemic rocks global supply and demand chains, disrupting food supplies.

According to CFR, given these dire conditions, African governments will grow desperate for revenue and foreign exchange, both of which are drying up; they will be forced to find relief from international financial institutions and foreign governments.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/24/coronavirus-oil-price-collapse-threatens-vulnerable-african-economies/
['Ben Kew'],2020-04-24,Founder of Africa's Famous Dancing Pallbearers Speaks,"The founder of a dance troupe in Ghana that has become world-famous for dancing with coffins at funerals said in an interview published Thursday his business caters to the idea that people prefer to say goodbye to their loved ones with joy.

When contacted by the Argentinian media outlet Infobae, John Telewa, a representative for the founder of Pallbearing Dancer Benjamin Aidoo, revealed the group had received dozens of interview requests since video of their performances became a global meme.

The pallbearers gained international recognition in 2017 when they were filmed doing flamboyant coffin-carrying dances at funerals. Yet since the rising number of deaths caused by the Chinese coronavirus, the meme has come back into fashion as families employ pallbearers to replicate the dance.

In the beginning, Aidoo and his team would wear black and white as a show of respect to the deceased. However, they later decided to lighten things up by designing garments of bright colors to perform in.

“We know that something very horrible is happening all over the world, but we are also proud that our videos help people to have a little fun,” Aidoo said in the interview. “When I was young I wanted to be a doctor. It was my dream, to take care of all my loved ones. But life took me to different places and I ended up working in funeral services. I would have never imagined it.”

“Initially, some members of my team and I worked in a more classic funeral procession service. Although funerals in our country always had a festive atmosphere, this was more solemn. Carry the coffin and little else,” he recalled. “Then one day we decided to make a change. We wanted to end all the solemnity of that ceremony and pay tribute to the cultural origin of our country. The coffin carrying dance was a way of celebrating this person’s life.”

In recent weeks, the footage has surged in popularity.

Last week, police in the Colombian city of Quibdó attempted to promote social distancing and other Chinese coronavirus safety measures by recreating the meme, carrying a coffin through the streets while moving to the rhythm of house music. As the procession took place, other officers instructed the public on how to wash their hands, while one officer holding a megaphone urged people to stay at home and respect the nationwide quarantine.

['Frances Martel'],2020-04-23,Boko Haram 'Expanding into the Void' Created by Coronavirus,"The Christian aid organization Open Doors warned on Wednesday that mounting reports from Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon suggest that the jihadist organization Boko Haram is taking advantage of governments struggling to contain the Chinese coronavirus to expand their violent attacks.

Boko Haram originated in northeastern Borno state, Nigeria, and has for years plagued the region with suicide attacks, kidnappings, village raids, and other acts of terrorism. The Open Doors report follows a string of attacks in late March and early April, and a series of assurances from the Nigerian government that Boko Haram is close to total defeat.

The government of President Muhammadu Buhari first declared victory over Boko Haram in 2015, the year Buhari was elected. More recently, Buhari’s officials have claimed that Boko Haram no longer exists as it did in 2015, but has evolved into the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and that this is the only clear jihadist threat to Borno.

Boko Haram renamed itself “ISWAP” in April 2015.

In past years, jihadist groups such as Boko Haram have escalated their attacks during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which begins on Thursday evening.

“Boko Haram and its splinter groups are opportunistically expanding into the void of governance left when all attention and resources are focused on containing the coronavirus,” David Curry, the CEO of Open Doors, said in a press statement on Wednesday. “We are already seeing the geographic spread of religiously-motivated violent attacks, from Nigeria into Burkina Faso and, most recently, Chad.”

“Boko Haram wants an ISIS-like caliphate and weak regional governments are looking the other way. We can’t remain silent while this persists,” Curry said. “We should consider this a precursor for the eventual spread of targeted attacks against Christians throughout the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa. We’re calling on Christians to mobilize support for those affected, today and in the days to come.”

Curry added in remarks to Breitbart News that Open Doors expects that more violence against Christians in the region is possible in the near future.

“While millions of people peacefully celebrate Ramadan, small factions of extremists perpetuate attacks during this time, due in part to a seasonal increase of religious fervor. Christians especially can be targeted when they do not observe Ramadan rituals,” Curry told Breitbart News. “Based on the recent influx of attacks in Nigeria and neighboring countries, we believe that extremists are taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out attacks while governments are distracted by efforts to contain the Coronavirus.”

“We expect heightened tensions to continue in the coming months, so it’s important for all people of faith to be thoughtful and prayerful for religious minorities who are suffering, today and everyday,” Curry concluded.

Nigeria has, at press time, documented 873 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 28 deaths. As it boasts minimal resources to test individuals, particularly in remote areas, these numbers may be significantly deflated. In Kano, northwest Nigeria, locals have reported as many as 150 unexplained deaths, but no access to tests to confirm if they were coronavirus patients.

Late March saw an escalation of Boko Haram attacks, including a March 22 attack that resulted in the deaths of 92 Chadian soldiers. Another 50 Nigerian soldiers died in an attack the next day.

Throughout early April, Boko Haram conducted at least one suicide bombing in Cameroon – targeting a primary school – and a village raid in northeast Nigeria. Village raids typically feature jihadists burning down the homes of locals, ransacking shops and other businesses, looting, kidnapping young women and girls, and killing the men in the village.

Open Doors cited a partner in the region identified as Suleimani M., who observed, “In the midst of the coronavirus situation, the attacks on Christians have not stopped. Just last week, two villages in northern Nigeria were attacked and people were killed. A number of villages were also attacked in Kaduna. Boko Haram continues to wreak havoc.”

The Council on Foreign Relations noted that audio claiming to be of the head of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, surfaced last week asserting that the Chinese coronavirus does not affect Muslims.

“We pray five times a day, we pray Jummu’a, we sleep with our families, we hug, we shake hands, we are fine, fine fine,” the voice claiming to be Shekau said. “We have anti-virus while you are infected with the coronavirus, we have anti-coronavirus; it is the Allah we worship. We pray, we slash fornicators, we cut hands [chop hands off].”

The question of whether Shekau himself approved of pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, and if he controls most of the jihadists identified with Boko Haram, has been a matter of contention for years. Nigerian officials claim that ISWAP is a splinter group inspired to follow late “caliph” Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and that Shekau does not control them.

Nigerian officials have also repeatedly claimed they have killed Shekau, which has not stopped audio allegedly of the Boko Haram leader from surfacing and issuing orders to followers.

Nigerian government and military officials have indicated contrary conditions on the ground in the fight against the jihadist group.

“Major General John Enenche, Coordinator, Defence Media Operations said yesterday that scores of Boko Haram terrorists have been surrendering in the past 48 hours, sensing that doom loomed for them,” Nigeria’s Vanguard newspaper reported on April 18, the day after the Council of Foreign Relations reported on the contents of the alleged Shekau audio. “Their leader, Abubakar Shekau, was said to be making frantic efforts to seek a soft landing as he prepares to surrender, the military said.”

“I think the end of Boko Haram is coming close as Abubakar Shekau has been making overtures through proxies for a soft landing for him to surrender to the Nigerian authorities,” Vanguard reported, citing the quote to “sources … familiar with the goings on.”

On Sunday, Premium Times, another Nigerian newspaper, cited the military as announcing the death of 105 Boko Haram jihadists.

Nigerian military sources told Vanguard on Monday that Boko Haram was so weak that its members were fighting fully armed soldiers by hurling stones at them, a report at odds with the large death tolls of Boko Haram attacks in late March.

The reports did not mention the Shekau video, nor did the sources attempt to explain why the operations were necessary if Boko Haram had been defeated in 2015.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-23,Kenya: Parents Use School Coronavirus Lockdowns for FGM,"Rural communities in Kenya are reportedly taking advantage of school closures due to the coronavirus to perform female genital mutilation (FGM), Reuters reported on Tuesday.

In Kenya, 21 percent of women and girls, aged 15-49, have undergone FGM, according to United Nations data. The procedure requires the partial or total removal of the female genitalia and can cause grave health problems for the entirety of a girl’s lifetime and death.

In 2011, Kenya criminalized FGM with a punishment of three years imprisonment and a $2,000 fine. Nonetheless, Kenyans continue to perform the barbaric procedure; some communities erroneously view the gruesome ritual as necessary for girls’ social acceptance and marriage prospects.

On April 6, Kenya’s president placed some parts of the country on lockdown, limiting people’s movements to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. On March 27, Kenya had enacted a dusk-to-dawn curfew. With the new restrictions on movement, young people are confined to their homes more than usual. In Kenya’s northern Samburu county, schools were closed early on March 16 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, reports of FGM have increased in this county.

In an interview with Reuters published on Tuesday, Bernadette Loloju, chief executive of the semiautonomous government agency Anti-FGM Board, said she had received several reports that girls – specifically girls kept home from school – had been forced to undergo FGM in Samburu.

“We did confirm one girl who was at risk [of FGM] and a case is registered with the police, and her mother has been arrested,” said Loloju, adding that the child was about 12 years old.

“We don’t want to take any chances. We have to be vigilant, which is why we are trying to step up efforts in light of this [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic,” Loloju said.

Authorities have since asked village chiefs and community workers to visit rural communities in Samburu county and report cases where girls may be at risk, according to Loloju.

Last year, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to end FGM in Kenya by 2022. At the time of the announcement, women’s rights groups argued that the goal was unrealistic due to many factors in Kenya, such as remote locations, severe poverty, and a high prevalence rate in certain parts of the country.

The practice occurs throughout Africa. In Egypt, a 12-year-old died in January after an FGM procedure was forced upon her by her parents, who were later arrested.

Two migrants were able to contact a lawyer and start an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights while they were still in the process of crossing the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy, shortly after they had departed from the port of Al Khoms, near Tripoli.

Sudanese migrant Abdel Wahab Mohamed and Ivorian migrant Naseneva Diabj were able to contact Italian lawyer Lucia Gennari who works for the migrant transport NGO Mediterranea-Saving Humans, according to a report published last month.

The testimony of the migrants, according to a report from newspaper Il Giornale published this week, was presented to the court in Strasbourg while they were still at sea and claimed that 47 migrants were aboard the ship, several of them ill.

Whistleblower Who Reported Migrant Transport NGO Smuggler Links Lives in Fear After Death Threats https://t.co/8NstEBqn5A — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 23, 2018

Two complaints were filed over that Easter weekend, one demanding the migrants be given a safe haven in Malta and another listing alleged human rights violations by Malta and Italy.

The migrants aboard the dinghy, including the two who contacted the Italian lawyer, were later recovered by a fishing vessel which took them all back to Libya.

Previously, migrant transport NGOs have denied links to people traffickers in North Africa, while Italian prosecutors have asserted the groups have direct links.

In 2017, Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio released images allegedly showing people traffickers working with the German-based NGO Jugend Rettet and its ship the Iuventa in the search and rescue area off the coast of Libya.

“The evidence is serious. We have evidence of encounters between smugglers who have accompanied illegal immigrants to the ‘Iuventa’, and members of the crew,” Cartosio said at the time.

A year later, a former security staff member for the NGO Save the Children made similar claims and stated the NGOs “filmed and knew everything. They didn’t want any information to come out of the ship without their approval.”

The outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus has largely stopped migrant transport NGO activity in the Mediterranean, with Sea-Eye being one of the few still active.

['Gabrielle Reyes'],2020-04-22,"Report: Uganda Arresting, Torturing Journalists for Coronavirus Content","Ugandan security forces arrested and allegedly tortured a writer last week and arrested a television news anchor this week in two separate incidents, reportedly for their social media posts related to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Voice of America (VOA) reported on Tuesday.

Author and activist Kakwenza Rukirabashaija appeared in court on April 20, charged with “conducting an act likely to spread a disease,” referring to the Chinese coronavirus. Kakwenza’s lawyer claims “torture marks” were visible on his body after his release from detention.

Police detained TV anchor Samson Kasumba on April 20 and said he was under investigation for “alleged subversive activities.” Kasumba was released on police bond on April 21, according to Uganda’s PML Daily.

A political activist linked to Uganda’s main opposition party, Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), Kakwenza was arrested on April 13 by military police, who raided his home in Iganga, Eastern Uganda, Amnesty International reported on Monday.

After his arrest, Kakwenza was charged with conducting an act likely to spread a disease. Amnesty International said he was also charged with defamation and cyber-related crimes.

On Monday, Kakwenza’s lawyer, Eron Kiiza, told VOA that his client displayed “torture marks” on his body after his release from detention in military barracks.

“They produced him in court … in Iganga and he was remanded up to May 6. They refused him the chance to make his bail application yesterday, and he has some torture marks, especially on his feet,” Kiiza said. “But we are happy that he’s at least [been transferred] from military detention to civil detention.”

Kakwenza is the author of The Greedy Barbarian, widely viewed as a commentary on Uganda’s authoritarian leader, Yoweri Museveni. According to the human rights organization Amnesty International, the book “criticizes the ruling first family of Uganda.”

Kakwenza stood accused of posting a Facebook message on April 6 that allegedly discouraged the public from complying with public health guidelines issued to curb the spread of Chinese coronavirus. He has also been “documenting cases of police killings and brutality during the ongoing Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] lockdown in Uganda,” according to Amnesty International.

In the post, Kakwenza included a picture taken inside a market, showing how people in Iganga were ignoring government guidelines on physical distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. According to VOA, Kakwenza’s message urged Museveni to “be serious” about coronavirus guidelines and said, “If the country plunges into the abyss of famine … never blame coronavirus but yourself and bigoted methods.”

On April 14, Museveni extended Uganda’s 14-day lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus for three more weeks, until May 5. Under the lockdown, public transportation and large gatherings are banned. A nighttime curfew has been enforced, and schools are closed. Only groups of five or less are allowed to be together in public.

In a separate incident, police arrested a Kampala television anchor, Samson Kasumba, on April 20.

“He’s a subject of investigation and it’s not connected in any way to his journalistic work. But he’s being investigated together with others for alleged subversive activities,” police spokesman Fred Enanga reportedly said, without specifying what the “alleged activities” were.

Upon his release on police bond on April 21, Kasumba was interviewed by NBS TV, his employer. Kasumba said police told him that he had been arrested because he “acted seditiously, undermining the authority of the government of the Republic of Uganda” and for “spreading harmful propaganda.”

Over the weekend, Kasuma posted a Facebook message that said that recoveries have surpassed active cases in Uganda. He asked if Uganda was the first country to accomplish this.

VOA reported on Monday that media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders has recorded 65 press freedom violations in sub-Saharan Africa since the pandemic arrived on the continent; African authorities in multiple countries have been cracking down on journalists who question the government’s official narrative on the coronavirus pandemic.

Last month, Ugandan officials arrested a pastor for claiming coronavirus “does not exist in Africa.” Authorities also arrested almost 30 people for violating the country’s current coronavirus ban on large gatherings when they met for church services.

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-04-22,Islamists Severely Beat Christian Woman with Sticks in Eastern Uganda,"Islamic radicals severely beat 23-year-old Lydia Nabirye in Eastern Uganda, after the woman shared her Christian faith with a Muslim woman who subsequently converted to Christianity.

Morning Star News reported Monday both Ms. Nabirye and the young woman who converted from Islam to Christianity received beatings. The Christian convert, who is pregnant and preferred to remain anonymous, sustained serious injuries as a result of the assault.

Nabirye, the daughter of a Church of God evangelist, offered refuge to the young convert in her home after Muslim family members of the woman threatened her. Six other former Muslims are also staying with her after receiving similar threats.

“Her mother knows that her daughter is with me, because we have been close friends with her for more than four years,” Nabirye told Morning Star News by phone. “The family knows about our relationship with her.”

The beating of Ms. Nabirye occurred on April 7 when she went to console another former Muslim who was mourning the loss of a son who had died and Muslims saw her entering the property. Nabirye was attacked by a band of radical Muslims while she was walking back to her village.

“They held me and started beating me up,” Nabirye said. “They slapped me, and others hit me with sticks, saying that they were out to kill me because I was changing Muslims to become Christians.”

One witness to the assault said that the Muslims ambushed, strangled, and severely beat Nabirye. Neighbors called the police when they heard the woman screaming and the attackers fled the scene when police arrived, he said.

“When I met her at her home on April 14, she was still in pain from multiple injuries – head, right eye and left hand injuries,” the witness told Morning Star News, adding that Nabirye’s father is fearful of a possible attack since Muslims from a nearby village have sworn to do him harm.

Although Uganda’s constitution provides for religious freedom, including the right to proselytize, in practice Christian evangelization is very dangerous since converts often suffer retribution from their families and the Muslim community.

Although Uganda has a large Christian population, the eastern part of the country has a significant Muslim component and it is there where much of the persecution of Christians takes place, especially in the case of converts to Christianity. Christians in eastern Uganda are among those who face the most serious dangers in the world, according to World Watch Monitor, a group that tracks the global persecution of Christians.

During the 1970s, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin made Uganda a member of the Organization of Islamic Countries and begin to Islamize the nation; many of Amin’s policies continue to influence the country today.

Some Arab nations have invested substantial sums into furthering Muslim interests within Uganda and the influence of radical Islam has reportedly grown by more than 7 percent in the last three years.

Uganda’s parliament, for instance, recently passed Sharia banking, which gives zero-interest loans to Islamic projects.

The Christian persecution watchdog group Voice of the Martyrs (VOM) has designated Uganda as a “hostile area” for Christians, a term describing a situation where governments may attempt to provide protection for the Christian population but Christians are still routinely persecuted by family, friends, neighbors, or political groups.

Nigeria has failed to confirm if the ailment was the Chinese coronavirus.

The group was so large that the bodies were buried across three cemeteries. On Tuesday, undertakers who also served as gravediggers in the affected cemeteries told the Daily Trust that they had received an unprecedented number of corpses in recent days.

“This is worrisome, we are becoming overwhelmed by what we are seeing here these days because, to me, the way people are dying is not ordinary,” said Bashir Mohammed, one of the undertakers at the Dandolo Cemetery in Goron Dutse, located in the Dala area of Kano.

According to the Daily Trust, the undertakers urged the government to investigate the “real cause” of the deaths; on Tuesday, Nigeria’s Ministry of Health said it was investigating the matter.

News of the deaths in Kano has “thrown many residents of the city into palpable fears … as they nurse the suspicion of possible community transmission of the ravaging COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] within the state capital [Abuja],” Daily Trust correspondents reported on Tuesday.

As of Monday, Kano had officially reported 59 coronavirus infections and one death, according to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC). Kano is the second-largest city in Nigeria, with a population of nearly four million people.

The policemen allegedly violated South Africa’s National Disaster Management Regulations, enacted as part of a five-week lockdown announced on March 27 to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus in the country. The officers were also charged with corruption. The arrests occurred over three separate incidents across the country, according to national police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo.

In the first incident on Saturday, five SAPS officers were arrested for allegedly drinking alcohol at a local bar in Phuthaditjhaba in South Africa’s Free State province. Photos of the policemen drinking in the bar, and their subsequent arrest, circulated throughout South African social media over the weekend. Images of the officers being apprehended show some of them lying on the floor, face down, with their hands cuffed behind their backs.

“While the greater majority of SAPS members have been hard at work to flatten the curve of the spread of the Covid-19 virus [Chinese coronavirus], there have been some members disregarding the regulations as well as committing some heinous crimes, thus bringing into disrepute both the SAPS as well as the good work its members are doing,” Naidoo said on Monday, as reported by News24.

The bar’s owner was also arrested on Saturday for violating regulations on the prohibition of the sale of liquor during the lockdown. All liquor was seized and authorities shut down the bar.

“The police officials will be charged with defeating the ends of justice and failing to enforce and adhere to the National Disaster Management Regulations,” Naidoo added.

In the second incident, also on Saturday, six officers connected to police stations in Pretoria, South Africa’s administrative capital, were arrested for stealing more than R30,000 [$1,596] from civilians caught in a roadblock, set up to limit people’s movement during the lockdown.

The officers reportedly first demanded a bribe of R100 [$5] after realizing that the driver of a car and two passengers lacked the required documentation to pass through the checkpoint, according to Naido. The officers allegedly stole the money later, while conducting a search of the vehicle at the roadblock. All six police officers were found in possession of the stolen money and arrested; they are being detained at a local Pretoria police station.

In the third incident, police detained one of their own officers after he allegedly hosted a gathering at the police barracks in Soshanguve, Tshwane, about 18 miles north of Pretoria.

The article, appearing in the Communist Party newspaper the Global Times, appeared to be a response to calls this week for wealthy nations to suspend Africa’s debt payments until the end of the year, as the world faces a possible financial recession due to economic shutdowns caused by the Wuhan coronavirus.

Indebted African countries have been hit especially hard by the current economic slowdown “due to plummeting oil and commodity prices and weaker currencies, which ramp up external debt servicing costs,” according to a Reuters report on Monday. Some African nations may see as many as 20 million jobs lost as a result of the pandemic. On Wednesday, the Group of 20 (G20) economies, including China, the United States, India, and others, offered to suspend Africa’s debt payments until the end of 2020.

However, on Thursday, Ministry of Commerce official Song Wei – identified officially as “deputy director at the Ministry of Commerce’s Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation” – wrote that China should not write off African nations’ debt as international financial institutions have recommended, claiming such measures were “not effective.”

“The whole world is facing mounting pressure on pandemic prevention and consequent economic contraction as the novel [Wuhan] coronavirus ripples across the planet,” Song said. “China, as a creditor of some African countries, has been called upon to offer debt relief which actually is not simple nor effective.”

China is not just a creditor to “some” African countries; it is the single largest creditor to the African continent.

“What China could do to help is bring projects funded by loans back to life and realize sustainable profits, instead of measures as simple as offering write-offs. As always, China is open to talk with debtors on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,” the statement said. “Simply waiving debtors’ obligations as some countries or organizations have called for is not going to be effective as a solution. If any debtors encounter difficulties to pay on time, there may be tailored plans including rescheduling or China increasing funding to help related projects resume operation and return profits.”

African countries already deeply indebted to China through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) face serious economic trouble from the looming recession. Through the BRI, China establishes economically predatory infrastructure projects in developing nations to expand its influence. According to the Center for Global Development (CGD), Niger and Angola are among the African BRI countries likely to encounter future economic difficulties.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified 16 sub-Saharan African countries as either being in debt distress or at high risk from the possible pandemic recession, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on April 3.

African countries have called for $100 billion in bailouts and debt relief to help them cope with the negative effects of the economic shutdown caused by the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, according to SCMP‘s report.

This week, international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for wealthy nations to place a payment moratorium on bilateral debt owed by the world’s poorest countries, among them many African nations.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/04/18/china-says-no-to-writing-off-africas-belt-and-road-debts/
['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-05,WATCH: Korean Baseball Returns with Socially Distant First Pitch,"Baseball has returned to South Korea, but it certainly did not start in a way that anyone would recognize.

The first day of baseball in the Korean league began with a tradition that most Americans would recognize, the first pitch. Though, that’s where the similarities would end, as the kid selected to make the first pitch walked to home plate in a bubble.

Watch:

Nice of the hitter to take a mock swing at the kid in the bubble just before he got to home plate.

The scene would have seemed odd at any other point in world history, but not so much in our current pandemic predicament. Of course, people will take sports in any form from any country nowadays. ESPN is broadcasting six Korean baseball league games a week after the Scott Van Pelt Show, just to give American fans some much needed sports relief.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-05,"U.S. Women’s Soccer Stars Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan Vow to Keeping Fighting After Equal Pay Lawsuit Tossed","U.S. women’s soccer stars Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan have vowed to fight on after a lawsuit alleging unequal pay was tossed out by a federal judge.

Last week, U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner tossed out the U.S. Women’s National Team’s claim that they have been discriminated against with how much they are paid compared to the U.S. men’s team. Judge Klausner, though, did allow other aspects of the lawsuit to go forward to trial.

Still, the USWNT’s biggest personalities, Rapinoe and Morgan, are vowing to continue their crusade.

“This decision was out of left field for us,” Morgan told the hosts of Good Morning America on Monday. “We are fighters and we will continue to fight together for this.”

The court didn’t merely cancel the equal pay part of the players’ lawsuit. In his decision, Judge Klausner actually refuted the women’s charge.

“The WNT [Women’s National Team] has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT [Men’s National Team] over the class period,” Klausner wrote in his decision.

Rapinoe, though, slammed the determination.

“If I earn one dollar every time I play, and a man earns three dollars, just because I win ten games, and he only wins three games — and so I make 10 dollars, and he made nine dollars — I’m not sure how that’s me making more money,” Rapinoe said according to ESPN.

Despite the court’s decision, the U.S. Men’s National Team Players Association reiterated support for the women players.

“The USMNT players continue to stand with the WNT players in their efforts to secure equal pay,” the group said on Monday.

“For a year and a half the USMNT players have made proposals to the Federation that would achieve equal pay for the USMNT and USWNT players,” the group concluded.

[],2020-05-05,WATCH: Djokovic Appears to Break Confinement Rules in Spain,"MADRID (AP) — Novak Djokovic apparently broke confinement rules in Spain by going back to a tennis court on Monday.

Djokovic posted a video on Instagram showing him exchanging shots with another man at a tennis club in the coastal city of Marbella, where the Serb has reportedly stayed.

Djokovic filmed the video while hitting shots and wrote he was “so happy to play on clay .. well, just for a bit with my phone in the hands.”

Spain on Monday loosened some of the lockdown measures that had been in place since mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, allowing professional athletes to return to practice. But sports facilities are supposed to remain closed at least until next week in most parts of the country, with the exception of training centers for teams in professional leagues in sports such as soccer.

The Spanish tennis federation said in a statement on Monday that professional players in Spain were allowed to exercize by themselves or with a coach, but not yet on a tennis court. It said it would work on a set of guidelines to inform players and clubs about what they would be permitted to do beginning next week.

The federation’s statement did not appear to be related to Djokovic’s appearance on the court in Marbella.

Requests for comment made to the federation and to Djokovic’s staff late on Monday were not immediately answered.

It was not clear if Djokovic, the reigning AustraliA would be subjected to fines or sanctions if it was confirmed he broke the lockdown rules.

The No. 1-ranked Djokovic recently said he was against taking an anti-coronavirus vaccination if it became mandatory to travel once the pandemic subsides, though he later said he was open to changing his mind.

Spain was one of the hardest hit countries by the pandemic but it started loosening some of its restrictions on movement as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 started to go down in recent weeks.

World No. 1 ranked pro Rory McIlroy will join one-time U.S. Open winner Dustin Johnson to face off against second place 2018 Masters Tournament player Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff the latter of whom only just turned pro in 2019. The four will tee off for the TaylorMade Driving Relief charity match, Golfweek reported.

The match will be held at Seminole Golf Club, a Donald Ross layout in Juno Beach, Florida.

“I’m pretty excited to do a small part to raise some money and raise some awareness in these challenging times,” McIlroy said Monday on The Today Show.

“When I heard about this event, I couldn’t get involved fast enough,” Fowler added. “I know how much I’ve missed sports and golf, especially, so to be one of the first events returning to television is very exciting.”

UnitedHealth Group and Farmers Insurance are also jumping in to help sponsor the event.

“I think golf can return to doing things like this,” McIlroy said on Monday. “We can keep ourselves socially distant, keep ourselves in different carts, and stay obviously more than 6 feet away from one another, and that’s really important too, so, taking all the necessary precautions to put this match on.

“It’s been difficult to witness what so many are enduring over the last several weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic…I hope we can provide some respite and entertainment for those tuning in across the globe,” the top pro added in a press release.

This will be the first new pro golf that has hit televisions since the COVID-19 scare shut down sports across the world on March 12. The PGA has announced that it will resume play on June 11 with the PGA’s Charles Schwab Challenge.

The survey, known as the ESPN Coronavirus Lockdown Fan Study, sought input form 1,004 adult sports fans. According to the results, 65% of fans approved of a return to sports even if it meant fans could not attend. A larger majority, 76%, said they would approve of a return to sports without fans coupled with players being kept in hotels and closely monitored.

According to ESPN:

Whenever sports do return, 88% of study participants who consider themselves avid sports fans said they plan to watch as much sports as they can. The ESPN Coronavirus Lockdown Fan Study was conducted nationwide April 17-20 with subsequent waves scheduled over the next few months to monitor and track any important shifts in fan sentiment

Games without fans has been a common theme across all sports leagues, as reports emerge about plans to return. In addition, several leagues, most notably the NBA, are working out ways of keeping players in “bubbles.” The primary purpose of which would be to regulate player movement and access from the public. Having players in designated areas would also make testing much easier.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-04,WATCH: Police Smash Former Raiders RB Darren McFadden’s Windows During Arrest Attempt,"Intense video has been released, showing Dallas police officers arresting former Cowboys and Raiders running back Darren McFadden.

In the video obtained by TMZ Sports, police discovered McFadden asleep with his vehicle still running outside a restaurant in McKinney, Texas, in January of last year.

Officers began tapping on the window and rocking the SUV to wake the former player from his slumber.

But as the officers were attempting to rouse McFadden, his foot reportedly slipped off the car’s brakes, and the vehicle rolled into the Whataburger location. From there, things immediately escalated.

Officers smashed the windows of the vehicle and began trying to pull the two-time Heisman Trophy runner up out of the car, but he began resisting the officers.

The video shows a chaotic scene as officer tried to arrest the resisting, allegedly drunken former player.

Officials charged McFadden, 32, with resisting arrest and a DWI with a BAC of greater than or equal to .15. Later, in February, he reached a plea deal, allowing the arrest to be dropped in exchange for a guilty plea to the DWI. McFadden was then sentenced him to four days in jail, with one day served, and suspended his driver’s license for 90 days.

McFadden was a No. 4 overall pick for the Oakland Raiders in 2008, played with them for seven years, and the finished his NFL career with a three-year stint with the Dallas Cowboys. During his ten-year career, he rushed for 5,421 yards and made 28 touchdowns.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-04,"Michael Jordan: ‘I Was a Basketball Player, Not a Politician’","NBA GOAT Michael Jordan reiterated his stance that he never wanted to speak about politics when he was a player and that his “Republicans buy sneakers” line was “said in jest.”

Appearing on ESPN’s The Last Dance on Sunday, Jordan said that he generally wanted to stay away from taking political stances when he was the NBA’s most notable player. He also said that he did not want to be a role model. He just wanted to play basketball, ESPN noted.

Jordan’s attitude was famously summed up in a line he delivered during the 1990 U.S. Senate race in North Carolina when calls were made for the NBA star to campaign for Harvey Gantt in his 1990 race against Senator Jesse Helms.

During the campaign, Jordan was heard saying, “Republicans buy sneakers, too,” in response to questions of why he would not rise up to oppose Helms. He was attacked by left-wing activists as “cowardly” and was said to somehow support the “deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement” because he would not campaign for Gantt.

But Jordan is again insisting that the “sneakers” comment was an off-the-cuff comment made in jest.

“I don’t think that statement needs to be corrected because I said it in jest on a bus with Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen,” Jordan said on the ESPN show. “It was thrown off the cuff. My mother asked to do a PSA for Harvey Gantt, and I said, ‘Look, Mom, I’m not speaking out of pocket about someone that I don’t know. But I will send a contribution to support him.’ Which is what I did.”

Jordan added that he thinks highly of Muhammad Ali’s activism, but it wasn’t for him. “But I never thought of myself as an activist. I thought of myself as a basketball player,” he said.

“I wasn’t a politician when I was playing my sport. I was focused on my craft. Was that selfish? Probably. But that was my energy. That’s where my energy was,” Jordan added.

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-04,Legendary NFL Coach Don Shula Dead at 90,"The NFL’s all-time winningest coach, Don Shula, has passed away at the age of 90.

The Dolphins released a statement Monday morning lauding Shula’s legacy and expressing their sorrow at his passing.

“Don Shula was the patriarch of the Miami Dolphins for 50 years,” the team said. “He brought the winning edge to our franchise and put the Dolphins and the city of Miami on the national sports scene. Our deepest thoughts and prayers go out to Mary Anne along with his children, Dave, Donna, Sharon, Anne and Mike.”

According to Pro Football Talk:

A ninth-round pick out of John Carroll in 1951, Shula played defensive back for the Browns, Colts, and Washington through 1957. He returned to the NFL in 1960, as the Lions’ defensive coordinator. Three seasons later, the Colts hired Shula to serve as head coach. After the 1969 season, Shula signed to coach the Dolphins, with Miami giving up a first-round pick after the Colts charged Miami with tampering. It was nevertheless a great investment; the Dolphins went to the Super Bowl to cap the 1971 season (losing to the Cowboys), crafted the NFL’s only 17-0 season in 1972, and won another Super Bowl the next year.

Shula remained the Dolphins coach through the 1995 season, opting to retire after refusing to make sweeping changes to his coaching staff following a blowout loss to the Buffalo Bills. His 328 regular season wins are still an all-time best, Shula also had 19 postseason victories.

['Kevin Scholla'],2020-05-04,They Were the North: NHL Could Use a Quebec Nordiques Return,"Much like the Mets in New York and the White Sox in Chicago, the Quebec Nordiques were always the red-headed stepchild in their own home.

The mighty Yankees of the Bronx and the Teflon Cubs of the North Side, always seem to have the upper hand on their crosstown rivals. For the Nordiques, things were even worse. At least the Mets have won a couple of titles and for a good chunk of the 1980s, the Amazins were the talk of the Big Apple. The White Sox have just as many World Series championships as the Cubs even though Wrigley seems to attract more crowds. As for the Nordiques, the differences between them and the club they shared a province with, were much starker. The Nordiques of Quebec City never reached the Stanley Cup Finals in their history.

Meantime, the Montreal Canadiens have won the most Stanley Cups all-time. Despite that disparity, the Nordiques, like the Mets and White Sox, were a worthy thorn in their formidable foe’s side. A thorn that just wouldn’t go away. Until they literally had to go away.

The Quebec Nordiques skated from 1972-1979 in the WHA before entering the NHL. They would play on hockey’s biggest stage through the 1994-95 season. The Nords were loved by the fans at the Colisee de Quebec, where the franchise played all of their home games, and by countless fans throughout Quebec City. Then one day, they were gone.

Owner Marcel Aubut sold the Nordiques to COMSAT in 1995. The team was relocated to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. Aubut blamed Canada’s exchange rate and Quebec City’s overwhelming French-speaking population. Fans didn’t buy it. Aubut needed a police escort to get out of Dodge.

The cruelest blow came the following season. Colorado won the Stanley Cup. The team now known as the Avalanche won it all. This could have been the Nordiques. The Baltimore Ravens turned a similar trick in the NFL in 2000, but they were already in Maryland for five seasons. The old Browns fans were smarting for sure, but almost all of the players from the 1995 Cleveland squad had moved on before Baltimore won the Lombardi Trophy. That was not the case for Quebec fans. The Avs were chock full or Nordiques. Big-time players like Peter Forsberg, Adam Deadmarsh, Valeri Kamensky, and even Captain Joe Sakic were in Quebec City one moment and Denver the next. Men who were wearing the Quebec powder blue just months prior were now celebrating a championship in burgundy. The Avalanche added a second Cup in 2001. Colorado’s Rocky Mountain high was the lowest of lows for Quebec City. It didn’t seem right. It still doesn’t, a quarter-century later. After all of Art Modell’s transgressions, at least the Browns are back in Cleveland. Quebec City has not been as fortunate.

So why are the Nordiques seemingly gone for good? Who’s keeping the NHL out of Quebec City? The team drew very well during their time in the NHL. Fans packed the arena nightly to back their beloved team. They didn’t sell out all the time, but they sold out a lot. They were close to capacity often. Been to a Florida Panthers game in recent years? How about the Arizona Coyotes? Plenty, and I mean plenty, of seats are available. Even some teams with rich history struggle to bring in spectators. The four-time Stanley Cup champion New York Islanders ranked second to last in NHL attendance this season. The Nordiques would usually fall in the middle of the pack when it came to attendance numbers, maintaining their fanbase year in and year out. Quebec would often outdraw NHL stalwarts, like the Boston Bruins. Surely, fans like that would have a shot at bringing a team back to town, right?

Wrong. At least so far that’s been the resounding answer. Since the Nordiques left for Colorado, the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix (now Arizona) Coyotes, the Hartford Whalers changed to the Carolina Hurricanes, the Nashville Predators came on board, as did the Atlanta Thrashers, Columbus Blue Jackets, and Minnesota Wild. Then the Thrashers left Georgia for Winnipeg to become the new Jets, the Golden Knights landed in Las Vegas, and in 2018, Seattle was granted a franchise that is expected to start play in the 2021-22 season. That’s a lot of shuffling without any consideration for the great people and fans of Quebec City.

If NHL commissioner Gary Bettman doesn’t want to grant Quebec an outright expansion club, perhaps there are other ways to get the Nordiques back where they belong. The Ottawa Senators have the worst attendance in all of hockey. The Sens actually look up at the Isles, Panthers, and Coyotes. The team would surely draw better in Quebec. The current pandemic isn’t helping many franchises. When the NHL finally returns, some organizations that are already doing poorly may even do worse. Tough economic times could lead to another team or two looking for a new home. Quebec has one ready. It’s a state of the art place, too.

in 2015, the Videotron Centre opened its doors. The huge venue that cost $370 million in public funding was built with the idea of wooing NHL action back to “la capitale nationale”. Instead the 18,259 seat rink is home to the Quebec Remparts of the QMJHL and has served as host to some concerts and other shows. The largest public investment in city history could not get Bettman and friends moving.

The exchange rate is a real thing. Bettman has touched on this publicly, and he is not wrong. That said, a team with passionate fans like the Nordiques would surely be able to overcome that gap at the gate. Bettman wants to go to places the NHL hasn’t been before, thus Vegas. But, the Nordiques are special. Quebec is special. This would hardly be any grand experiment. We know what we would get and it would be great.

Bettman isn’t the only nemesis to Nords fans. Many believe their old on-ice foes may be playing a role in keeping them from returning to the ice as well. The Canadiens-Nordiques ferocious rivalry would instantly pick up again. That would be good for the Habs and the entire league. Surely, Montreal isn’t afraid of the Nords, right? Well, maybe not the team itself, but what about the owner?

Geoff Molson and his family probably aren’t too keen on sharing any fans with the Nordiques or anyone else for that matter. The Molson hate for the Nordiques goes way back and it’s not just about hockey. When the rivalry between the two clubs was at a fever pitch, the Canadiens and Nordiques were both owned by breweries. Molson for the Habs and O’Keefe for the Nords. Liquor stores would either hang the Molson calendar or the O’Keefe calendar, certainly not both. You were on one side or the other. Ultimately, just like on the ice, the Canadiens won out in the suds game, too. O’Keefe was sold in 1987 before merging with Molson in 1989.

The Nordiques never did back down from the big, bad, beer-bolstered Habs though. In 1984, the second-round playoff game now known as the ‘Good Friday Massacre’ took place. The contest was riddled with several brawls and plenty of blood. Montreal won the game 5-3 to clinch the series 4-2 and send Quebec home, but it was the wild fighting that made this a notable night in hockey history. Eleven players were ejected and 252 penalty minutes were doled out. Imagine that today? A real, bitter hockey rivalry. Not one between pundits, fantasy fans, or Twitter tough guys, but one between real men, fighting for their team, each other, and a major part of Canada. Who wouldn’t want at least a taste of that again?

The Battle of Quebec mostly went the Canadiens way. Montreal posted a 62-39-12 mark against Quebec. They met in the playoffs five times. The Habs took three of those series including the infamous clash in 1984. The 24-time Stanley Cup champion Canadiens came out on top more times than not, but it was never easy against those feisty Nords.

“The games between the Nordiques and Habs were once the biggest rivalry,” Richard Zemlak told Breitbart Sports. The former Nordique tough guy is positive that Quebec City yearns for another shot at Montreal. “Fans would love to rekindle their emotions to see the two teams lace them up again,” Zemlak said.

Zemlak has only fond memories of his playing days in Quebec. “The adrenaline and excitement and being fully alert for each game is what I remember most,” he said. “The intensity and emotions from start to finish were unbelievable.”

Quebec City is that kind of hockey hotbed. Nordiques fans created an electric atmosphere and players thrived off of it. “Wearing the jersey with that emblem was all about pride to represent the people of Quebec City,” said Zemlak. “We wanted to give them something to cheer about.” Cheer they did. They would love to cheer again.

The Quebec Nordiques haven’t played a hockey game since losing to the New York Rangers in the playoffs on May 16, 1995 at Madison Square Garden. That’s a long time ago. Yet, Nordiques fans are still passionate about their team. In some ways, more than ever. Web sites and social media pages calling on the NHL to bring back the Nordiques, are all over the Internet. Fans outside of Quebec City and even fans outside of Canada are joining the battle. Many American fans want the Nordiques back. Hockey fans want the Nordiques back. Most of all, Quebec City wants their Nordiques back. After all, it’s where they belong. The facility is ready. The fans have been ready. If only the powers that be had half the guts as those old, tough as nails Quebec teams had. Those teams that are remembered so fondly by so many.

Though fleeting, there is still a glimmer of hope that there may be something more than just memories, somewhere down the road, for the ever so loyal Quebec City faithful. The fans whose battle cry has changed over the years from ‘Go Nordiques Go’ to ‘Come Back Nordiques, Please Come Back’ certainly deserve better than this.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-03,Mark Cuban Slams Feds for Not ‘Hiring Unemployed’ to ‘Fight Coronavirus’,"Dallas Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban jumped to Twitter Sunday to scold the federal government for not hiring any of the millions of unemployed Americans to help track and fight the coronavirus.

In one tweet, the billionaire NBA owner took the federal government to task for allowing people to remain unemployed because the economy has been shut down due to the many stay-at-home orders preventing them from going to work.

“Explain to me why in the midst of 50m people unemployed or underemployed, the gov isn’t hiring and training MILLIONS to do Tracking/Tracing, Caring/Supporting at-risk populations and sanitization work? And now is the time to train/pay stay at home parents/caregivers as well,” he tweeted.

Cuban then asked if anyone was “paying attention” and added a list of names of high-profile members of the media and government.

Still, despite the scolding, Cuban also recently said that once the response to the pandemic is over, “things are going to be OK.”

The Shark Tank star told Fox Business Network’s Making Money with Charles Payne that once the “initial hurdle” of the viral outbreak gets cleared, “things are going to be OK.” He also urged the American people to take advantage of any available government programs to help them get through the crisis.

Cuban also scolded the media for censoring “critical information” and cutting the president’s coronavirus briefings.

“I was watching the press conference [on Monday],” Cuban told SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow. “There’s no disputing that there’s a lot of hyperbole and a lot of marketing going on in those briefings, but be that as it may, they got to a point where I think the head of FEMA was starting to present all the different data as it relates to personal protective equipment, and where masks were being delivered, where ventilators were being delivered, where gloves and isolation gowns were being delivered.”

Cuban continued, “To me, that was critical information because I — just as a citizen and knowing people who work on the front lines of healthcare — am concerned [and] I’m terrified for those folks when they go to work.”

Exclaiming, “this is not over yet,” Biden took to Twitter on Saturday after a federal judge threw out the USWNT’s lawsuit claiming they have been paid unequally.

“To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet,” Biden tweeted. “To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.”

To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet. To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding. https://t.co/XK6t9oM94k — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) May 2, 2020

On Friday, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California Judge R. Gary Klausner excluded the women’s unequal pay charge but allowed several other charges of discrimination — including claims over the use of charter flights — to go forward to trial.

Biden’s pandering to the U.S. women’s soccer team comes amid an avalanche of charges that he sexually harassed as many as eight women from the 1990s up until the time he was serving as Barack Obama’s vice president.

Even as Biden seems to be urging America’s female soccer players to keep fighting for their rights, he has refused to allow researchers, reporters, and prosecutors, to discover whether or not he had been the subject of harassment complaints by reviewing records from his days as a U.S. Senator.

[],2020-05-03,Leaders Chart Path Back to Playing Fields for Amateur Sports,"Doctors, scientists and sports leaders are outlining the path back to playing fields for children in grassroots sports — an exercise that will help inform major organizations on how to get their industries up and running as well amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

From New Zealand to Austria to the northwest corner of Utah, leaders are releasing regulations that have potential to impact everything from workouts at gyms to youth baseball leagues to elite-level training with an eye on the Olympics.

The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee distributed a seven-page set of guidelines of its own this week that called on participants to “self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 twice daily,” as one of several steps in a multilayered return scenario.

“In addition to the logistical challenges of returning to training following COVID- 19, there are also ethical and societal considerations that are beyond the scope of this document,” USOPC chief medical officer Jonathan Finnoff wrote in a nod to the uncharted territory that all sports are trying to negotiate.

The guidelines are being developed as some major pro leagues, including the NBA, target return-to-practice dates, while others, such as Major League Baseball, float ideas about starting or resuming their seasons in upcoming weeks. All these plans need some sort of signoff from health and government authorities, who themselves are looking at models of what sports will look like on a grassroots level — a calculation that has potential to impact decisions all the way up the chain of sports.

All entities are developing their plans with the knowledge that lives are at risk and that a single outbreak among teammates or training partners has the potential to shut down a facility — or derail an entire season.

The guidelines reviewed by The Associated Press had several things in common:

— All returns will begin with individual training or in very small groups.

— Very few spectators, if any, will be allowed. The USOPC also released a 13-page guide about sports event planning that asks, among other questions, “Can the financial risk be mitigated through means such as event insurance, establishing financial impact timelines for cancellation, reschedule the event for a later date, or negotiate a contract that limits negative financial impact?”

— Almost every participant will be subject to temperature checks and some sort of verification that he or she is healthy and hasn’t been in recent contact with anyone who has COVID-19.

— Participants will be grouped in ″bubbles″ — allowed to train with a specific group of people that will not change until restrictions are relaxed further.

— One key facet will be keeping track of it all — a role that private groups such as Utah-based Great Coach are trying to fill by offering apps, blogs and other online solutions that will help monitoring.

“The governors and president can say what they want, but when it comes to kids and amateur sports, the only way it’s going to happen is when parents feel like it’s safe for their kids to play again,” said Great Coach founder Bill Kerig, who estimates 45 million children participate in recreational sports across America.

A few test models are developing in Utah, where health authorities in the Logan area recently put out detailed guidelines of circumstances under which fitness centers can reopen, while organizers around Park City also try to develop scenarios for a return to play.

“The way we approach things is going to be driven by governmental restrictions and the easing of those restrictions down to the county level,” said Luke Bodensteiner, who coordinates youth sports programs as part of Utah’s Olympic Legacy Foundation.

Similar lists of best practices are emerging from points across the globe, all tailored to their specific locales and, in some cases, to specific sports, as well.

The U.S. Tennis Association, for example, released a detailed list of suggestions for grassroots players to return safely to the court. Among them: To avoid possible contamination via tennis balls, players should use their own individually marked set of balls to serve and should use their racket — no hands — to pass the other balls back to their opponents.

New Zealand’s national sports authority released a detailed flowchart last week outlining what sports and recreation would look like under four “alert” levels the country is using to define the stages of return from COVID-19.

Austria’s ski team put out its roadmap back to training, which will involve extensive health checks and individual training followed by work in small groups.

But, as Finnoff wrote in his preamble to the USOPC training guidelines, there are no one-size-fits-all answers to any of these questions.

“As a guideline meant to be used by sports as varied as archery and wrestling in locations as diverse as Minot and New York City … this document cannot be prescriptive,” he said. “Rather, it should spark thoughtful deliberation among athletes, coaches and staff, who will use this information to create their own unique return to training plan that is specific to their situation.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/03/leaders-chart-path-back-to-playing-fields-for-amateur-sports/
[],2020-05-03,WATCH: Secretariat Wins Virtual Kentucky Derby,"Secretariat won a virtual Kentucky Derby against 12 fellow Triple Crown winners, 47 years after the chestnut colt won the real race at Churchill Downs.

The 1 1/4-mile race featuring computer-generated imagery was held Saturday, the same day the 146th Derby had been scheduled until it was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby has been re-set for Sept. 5.

The 13 Triple Crown winners just raced virtually at Churchill Downs, broadcast on NBC and Secretariat, of course won. Still holds record for fastest Derby 47 years later. pic.twitter.com/psrCmiKBsU — Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) May 2, 2020

Secretariat was the 7-2 favorite, although there was no wagering. Instead, fans selecting the winning horse online were entered to win a VIP experience at the Derby this fall. Churchill Downs pledged to match $1 million in fan donations to COVID-19 relief.

The virtual Derby was part of NBC’s three-hour telecast that re-showed portions of the 2015 coverage in which American Pharoah won on his way to becoming racing’s first Triple Crown champion in 37 years.

The show opened with Churchill Downs bugler Steve Buttleman playing “Call to the Post” from the front steps of his Louisville home. It moved to the track, with shots of empty stands, betting windows and the jockeys’ room.

The track’s stable area is set to re-open May 11, with live racing expected to resume May 16.

“It’s weird not being there,” Bob Baffert, who trained American Pharoah, said in an interview from his California home.

Larry Collmus, who calls the Triple Crown races for NBC, provided a live call for the virtual Derby, seeing it unfold for the first time just as he would have been doing on the first Saturday in May.

“That was fun ”calling” Secretariat and the other Triple Crown winners,” he tweeted.

A virtual Seattle Slew, who won the 1977 Triple Crown, led much of the way until being overtaken in the stretch.

Secretariat surged to the lead in deep stretch in the middle of the track. No margins were provided.

The computer imagery failed to capture the dirt from the track that sticks to the horses running in the back, and there was no noise from the usual Derby day crowd of 150,000 or more. The race lacked the cavalry charge to the first turn that is typical of the usual 20-horse Derby field.

Secretariat was a two-time Horse of the Year and swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont, winning the last race by a record 31 lengths, in 1973.

Citation, the 1948 Triple Crown champion, finished second. Seattle Slew was third. Affirmed, the 1978 champion, was fourth, followed by American Pharoah.

NBC showed the real American Pharoah at Ashford Stud, where a flat-screen TV was set up in front of his stall to show the race. Now 8-years-old, he is a successful stallion with a stud fee of $200,000.

Churchill Downs analyzed the historical past performance of each Triple Crown winner and incorporated the opinions of horse racing experts who evaluated each contender’s achievements and put them into historical perspective.

That information, known as the fundamental probabilities, was fed into Inspire Entertainment’s computer models, which determined the final result by using those probabilities along with random number generation. The fundamental probabilities only determined the chances of each horse winning. Those with a higher probability value weren’t necessarily going to win; they just had a greater chance of doing so.

Also in the race were 1946 champion Assault, 1919 champion Sir Barton, 1930 champion Gallant Fox, 1937 champion War Admiral, 1941 champion Whirlaway, 1943 champion Count Fleet, 2018 champion Justify and 1935 champion Omaha.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/03/watch-secretariat-wins-virtual-kentucky-derby/

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-02,State of Play: How and When Sports Leagues Plan to Come Back,"President Trump has been consistent about his desire to see live sports action return to American televisions with or without fans. Dr. Fauci has been less consistent in his optimism, but since everyone is tired of listening to Fauci it’s time to take a look at the various sports leagues and what they’re doing to get back on the playing field.

Let’s start with the good news: NASCAR and the UFC are back:

The UFC actually beat NASCAR to the punch by announcing that they will host a slate of three events starting with UFC 249 in Florida on May 9th. UFC 249 will be a pay-per-view event featuring Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje fighting for the interim lightweight title and the right to face Khabib Nurmagomedov. The card will also feature Bantamweight Champion Henry Cejudo versus Dominick Cruz.

Then, the UFC will hold two Fight Night events on May13th and May 16th.

“All three will take place in an empty VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena and with numerous extra safety protocols in place because of the coronavirus crisis,” according to Yahoo! Sports.

NASCAR will follow quickly on the heels of the UFC when they resume their season May 17th at Darlington. Not only that, Darlington will be just the first of seven races in a 11-day stretch.

“{NASCAR} will hold three races over four days in Darlington before moving to the Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina on May 24, where it will hold four races in four days,” Yahoo! Sports reported.

All UFC and NASCAR events will take place without fans.

College Football:

The good news continues when it comes to the college gridiron. This week, Texas Tech and Texas A&M announced that they will resume classes in the fall with the intention of also playing football. Baylor University made a similar announcement recently as well. At least half a dozen other universities have announced that fall classes will be open.

That’s a huge development for college football considering that most universities had refused to hold athletic events if classes were not in session. To be clear, the universities have not said fans will be allowed to attend games.

The potential snag may come with Big 10 schools like Maryland and Rutgers, which are based in states with severe stay-at-home orders and social distancing restrictions in place. Though, several schools appear to be back on track to re-start.

MLB:

Major League Baseball was the only major sport to have the beginning of its season disrupted by the coronavirus. Given that, much of the talk about getting back to sports has centered around MLB. As Commissioner Manfred has said, he fully “anticipates” a return to baseball at some point this season, he just doesn’t know when that will happen.

There are two proposed plans that seem to be getting the most traction right now: First, a plan that would have the league re-draw divisions to essentially create a regional system with groups of teams playing at one stadium, similar to the NCAA Tournament.

The reported start time for this proposal is around mid-June.

The second proposal may still involve re-drawn divisions and regional play, but this plan has the league starting July 4th.

Proposed regional sites include Arizona, Florida, and Texas. Both plans center around a regular season of roughly 80-120 games, with an expanded postseason that would stretch well into the fall and even, possibly, winter. Of course, keeping the teams in regions would allow the league to conduct regular testing and control player movement much better than they normally would. So, the chatter is positive, in that it shows baseball is likely to return in the next six to eight weeks. However, as with all these discussions, fan attendance is no guarantee.

NBA:

MLB isn’t the only league looking for a way to protect and monitor their players. This week, a proposal which would have the NBA finish the remainder of their season in Disney World started gaining traction. Being able to keep players in a “bubble,” would absolutely allow the league to better test their players and regulate movement.

Not to mention that Disney would have a large incentive to help the NBA finish their season considering that ESPN – owned by Disney – has a massive contract with the league. As it stands, the league is set to re-open practice facilities in states where stay-at-home restrictions have been reduced, on May 8th.

NFL:

The American sports world cannot “be back,” until the NFL is back. The good news there is, the NFL appears to be on-track to open on schedule. Roger Goodell linked the country’s recovery to the league’s resumption of play, stressing how the sport can help the country heal.

“We can help bring our communities together,” Goodell said. “We can provide hope. We can provide a distraction from the everyday issues and show people that there is a future out there and that we’re all going to be part of that.”

In recent weeks one of the league’s most influential owners, the Falcons Arthur Blank, said that he envisions an on-time start for the NFL, just without fans. The NFL still faces the issues the rest of the leagues face when it comes to figuring out testing and regulating player movement. However, given their regularly scheduled September start, Roger Goodell’s league will have more time to figure this out.

For now, it appears the NFL will have a very abbreviated offseason and an on-time start. Though, a lot can change between now and September.

[],2020-05-02,Federal Judge Tosses Women’s Soccer Claim of Unequal Pay,"A federal judge threw out the unequal pay claim by players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team in a surprising loss for the defending World Cup champions but allowed their allegation of discriminatory working conditions to go to trial.

Players led by Alex Morgan sued in March 2019, claiming they have not been paid equally under their collective bargaining agreement to what the men’s national team receives under its labor deal. They asked for more than $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In a 32-page decision Friday, U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner granted in part a motion for partial summary judgment by the U.S. Soccer Federation. He threw out the Equal Pay Act allegations but left intact the Civil Rights Act claims.

“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote.

“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure,” he said.

Klausner left intact claims the USSF discriminated in the money it spent on commercial airfare, hotel accommodations, and medical and training support services.

A trial is scheduled for June 16 in federal court in Los Angeles.

“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the women’s players, said in a statement. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”

Players intend to ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Klausner’s decision, a move that could delay the trial into 2021 or later.

“If you know this team at all you know we have a lot of fight left in us. We knew this wasn’t going to be easy, change never is,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn wrote on Twitter.

While the Americans are the most successful women’s team, with four World Cup titles including the last two, the U.S. men did not even qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The USSF argued the women actually made more than the men both overall and by game average, and the women claimed they should have the same bonus structure as the men.

“Merely comparing what WNT players received under their own CBA with what they would have received under the MNT CBA discounts the value that the team placed on guaranteed benefits they receive under their agreement, which they opted for at the expense of higher performance-based bonuses,” Klausner wrote.

“This issue is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial,” he added.

Klausner also said the women could not go forward with their claim that the USSF discriminated against them by scheduling more games on artificial turf than the men had. He said there was not sufficient evidence to show that decisions on field surface were made for discriminatory reasons.

He rejected the USSF’s argument that the men had a competitive need for charter flights that the women lacked, allowing that part of the suit to go forward. The federation has argued that the men, who have struggled in World Cup qualifying, have more need for charters than the women in order to arrive more rested for their qualifiers.

“This rationale does not fully explain the gross disparity on money spent on airfare and hotels for the teams,” Klausner wrote.

In addition, the USSF has said spending in these areas has been equal since the women’s union agreed to a new labor deal in 2017.

Klausner allowed other claims of discriminatory travel accommodations, such as money spent on hotels and commercial flights, to go to trial along with claims on support services such as medical and training staff. He said the USSF’s lawyers waited until reply briefs to ask for those claims to be thrown out, which meant he did not have to consider them.

Seyfarth Shaw’s summary judgment motion for the USSF included arguments critical of American women’s players. That filing caused an uproar and led to the resignation of USSF president Carlos Cordeiro, who was replaced by Cindy Parlow Cone, a former national team player. Latham & Watkins took over as counsel and filed the reply brief.

Parlow Cone has said she hopes the suit can settle before a trial.

“We look forward to working with the women’s national team to chart a positive path forward to grow the game,” the USSF said in a statement. “We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our women’s national team remains the best in the world.”

Earlier Friday, the women asked that Parlow Cone be included as a trial witness. Their lawyers said although the federation backed off earlier arguments saying women were inferior to their male counterparts in skill and effort, it still planned to contest differences in responsibility.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/02/federal-judge-tosses-womens-soccer-claim-of-unequal-pay/
['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-01,Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: ‘America Needs Baseball’,"In a Thursday interview, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he told Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred that, “America Needs Baseball.”

Speaking to a local Louisville, Kentucky, radio station, McConnell noted that he recently spoke to Manfred.

“I called the commissioner of baseball a couple weeks ago and said, ‘America needs baseball. It’s a sign of getting back to normal. Any chance?'” McConnell told the hosts on 93.9 FM sports radio. “As you may have heard, there is discussion about having an abbreviated season beginning around the Fourth of July where teams would either play in their spring training sites in Arizona or Florida or play at home to largely empty stadiums. There’s an active discussion underway to salvage part of baseball season.”

McConnell is far from the only member of the establishment in D.C. to urge baseball’s return.

On Wednesday, the president spoke up for baseball, as well. “I’d like to see the Yankees play at Yankee Stadium,” Trump said at the White House while discussing the process to reopen America.

There has been a raft of reports from insiders offering a growing list of ideas on how to play a 2020 season. Some include having the season played only in warm climate states such as Arizona, Texas, and Florida.

Trump, though, was not fond of the idea.

“I see they have some ideas for baseball that are very different,” he said. “I guess I’m a traditionalist, but I think they’d be able to play at Yankee stadium with obviously smaller crowds and crowds would start to build as things get to be a little bit better.”

The president also said that he feels a stadium practicing social distancing would be odd. “When I look at a baseball game, I want to see people right next to each other; I don’t want to see four seats in between every person,” he said.

Trump also hoped for baseball’s return in comments on April 14 when he said, “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old.”

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-01,Report: NBA Urges No Testing for Asymptomatic Players,"The NBA has set a date for league practice facilities to re-open, however, that doesn’t mean they’re ready to start testing their asymptomatic players for the coronavirus.

Sources told ESPN that a memo was circulated league-wide, in which the NBA informed their teams that it would not be “appropriate in the current public health environment,” to test their asymptomatic players.

The league’s sensitivity on the subject stems from the backlash the league received when they began testing players for the virus right after suspending play. Because the league chose to test their players when testing wasn’t available to much of the public, the league was criticized.

According to ESPN:

Teams were instructed to make any decisions on testing any players or staff ‘in consultation with an infectious disease specialist, and in consideration of the patient’s individual circumstances and guidance on testing related to COVID-19 from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and from the local health authority in the team’s market.’ The memo also said the NBA is still looking at opportunities for leaguewide testing capabilities, and anticipates implementing one when team-organized activities resume.

The NBA, like the rest of the sports world, continues trying to navigate the unchartered waters of the coronavirus shut down and attempt to figure out the best course towards resuming play. While no certain date has been set for the leagues return, Commissioner Adam Silver has informed teams that they can begin opening practice facilities on May 8th, but only in locations where shelter-in-place restrictions have been lifted.

[],2020-05-01,"Woman Hit in Face by Ball at Wrigley Sues Cubs, MLB","CHICAGO (AP) — A woman who was struck in the face by a foul ball during a Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field two years ago has filed a lawsuit against the team and Major League Baseball.

In her lawsuit filed this week, Laiah Zuniga, 28, says the ball knocked her unconscious, caused fractures under both of her eyes and caused extensive damage to her teeth. She said it hit her because the stadium hadn’t extended the netting that protects fans from foul balls all the way down the third base line, where she was sitting.

“Major League Baseball and the Cubs were aware that severe injuries from foul balls could happen to its fans sitting in rows near the field because it had happened many times before,” Tracy Brammeier, an attorney at Clifford Law Offices representing Zuniga, said in a statement. ”Just last year the MLB announced that all 30 teams would extend netting, … but it’s too late for Laiah.”

The lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court also notes that the league’s recommendation for how far to extend such netting still leaves fans like Zuniga at risk of serious injury and points out that had the Cubs extended the netting farther, as some other teams have done, Zuniga would not have been injured.

The lawsuit, which seeks more than $50,000 in damages from the Cubs and MLB, is similar to one filed in 2017 by a suburban Chicago man who was blinded in one eye when he was hit by a foul ball at Wrigley. That case is pending.

Major League Baseball has come under fire from critics, including some players, who say the netting should be extended farther to protect fans. Last season in Houston, a foul ball off the bat of Cubs’ player Albert Almora Jr. struck a 2-year-old girl, fracturing her skull.

Professional sports teams have largely been protected from lawsuits by what is called the “baseball rule” that, as anyone who has read the back of a ticket stub knows, states that the ticket-holder assumes the risks and dangers that come with attending a game. That so-called “assumption of risk” has been spelled out on ticket stubs for more than a century.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/05/01/woman-hit-in-face-by-ball-at-wrigley-sues-cubs-mlb/
['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-01,WATCH: Cop Pulls Gun on Chiefs’ Bashaud Breeland During Arrest,"Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Bashaud Breeland was arrested for resisting a police officer at a South Carolina gas station on Tuesday.

According to photos of the incident, Breeland was at a gas pump at the station when police demanded he exit the vehicle and submit to arrest after a York County Sheriff’s Office deputy claimed he saw the player and two other men smoking pot, TMZ reported.

Breeland, though, resisted the officer, and several times pulled away from them as they attempted to put him in handcuffs. The confrontation escalated to the point where an officer warned Breeland that he would be tased if he did not comply.

Despite the warning, Breeland pulled away again and got into his vehicle. At that point, the officer drew their firearms and demanded that the player exit the vehicle and submit to arrest.

Breeland finally allowed himself to be cuffed, and he was taken to jail without further incident. He was booked on four charges, including resisting arrest and pot charges.

After being released, the 28-year-old 2014 NFL Draftee insisted he was framed in a now-deleted post to social media.

“I really was at a gas pump got approach by two guys police pulled up they throw something my car as police pulled up which the cop saw,” the post reportedly read. “I was the one detained wit charges that really shouldn’t be charged.”

Breland’s attorney also released a statement saying, “At the time of this encounter with law enforcement, Mr. Breeland was leaving a gas station store after making a lawful purchase.”

“Moments after returning to his vehicle,” the attorney continued, “a 2020 Range Rover with valid temporary paper tags, law enforcement officers approached Mr. Breeland and drew their weapons. We look forward to investigating why this level of force was necessary. Bashaud Breeland is innocent unless proven guilty. We look forward to the truth coming forward.”

KC Chiefs head coach Andy Reid says he has seen the video, but for now, has no comment until the incident plays out in the courts.

The Chiefs had re-signed Breeland to a one-year deal. However, it is a low-risk contract meaning the team could part ways with Breeland over his off-field issues.

['Dylan Gwinn'],2020-05-01,Report: Loss of Sports Revenue Due to Coronavirus Could Exceed $12 Billion,"The loss of television and ad revenue from the suspension of sports due to the coronavirus, will end up costing at least $12 billion, according to a recent analysis conducted for ESPN.

Those numbers, however, could become even dramatically worse if the college football and NFL seasons are seriously impacted by the virus.

“As an economist, you stand back, you look at the carnage that’s taking place — dumbfounded, awestruck, mind-numbing,” said Patrick Rishe, who heads-up the sports business program at Washington University. “All of those phrases, they’re all relevant because we just have never seen anything on this scale.”

According to ESPN:

At ESPN’s request, Rishe examined publicly available data to estimate the potential impact of the shutdown on the major pro leagues, the NCAA and youth sports. Emsi, a labor market analytics firm, worked with ESPN to provide estimates on sports-related jobs. In addition, ESPN interviewed economists, public officials, sports executives, concession workers, travel team organizers and others to assess the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on sports at all levels. Rishe’s analysis relies on assumptions that appear more remote with each passing day, such as the ability of Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer to salvage at least half their seasons with fans attending games. The analysis also assumes the NBA and NHL cancel the rest of their regular seasons and the playoffs are staged without fans. And that youth sports resume by July. The numbers include everything from the price of a ticket and a hot dog to the money you spend taking your daughter to an out-of-state soccer tournament. For example, the crisis stands to wipe out more than $3.25 billion that fans would have spent on pro sports. It would erase nearly $371 million in wages — approximately 20 million hours — for ticket takers, beer vendors and other stadium and arena employees. At least $2.2 billion of national TV revenue would be lost, as well as up to $2.4 billion in tourism related to youth sports.

Despite the enormous projected impact of Rishe’s analysis, the $12 billion figure does not account for financial losses from NASCAR, golf, tennis, or gambling. Not to mention losses from recreational sports and activities such as fishing and hunting.

“The stakes for sports become higher if part or all of the NFL and college football seasons are lost,” ESPN reports. “According to Rishe, each NFL regular-season game is worth nearly $24 million in revenue from TV rights alone — a figure larger than the budget for some Hollywood films. Collectively, the 65 college football programs in the Power 5 bring about $4 billion in revenue — money that makes up nearly half of all athletic department budgets.”

On a positive note, with Texas Tech, Texas A&M, and Baylor announcing that their campuses will be open in the fall and that they plan to play football, it looks as if the worst possible scenario will be avoided. Still, loss of ticket revenue if those games can’t be played with fans in attendance will still be significant.

['Warner Todd Huston'],2020-05-01,"Texas Tech, A&M, Baylor Unversities Set to Re-Open in Fall, Ready for Football","Baylor, Texas Tech, and Texas A&M universities have announced that they will re-open for classes in the fall and will also resume their sports programs at that time.

As the state of Texas begins loosening its state-wide lockdown, its universities and colleges are ready to resume operations, according to the Hill.

In a Thursday teleconference, Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp noted that the school is preparing to open 11 campuses for the fall semester. That includes the football program, he said, before adding that all due caution for student safety will be observed.

For his part, Texas Tech University President Lawrence Schovanec also told students and faculty to expect a re-opening for the fall semester. He also noted, precautions will be put in place.

“We need to recognize that campus life will be different when we return in the fall,” Schovanec said in a letter released Wednesday to the school. “We are developing several ways to reduce the density of groups in our student facilities, large lecture-based classrooms, and our popular campus areas. These same plans extend to special events, including athletics.”

Lone Star State universities and colleges closed in mid-March as fears over the coronavirus overtook the nation.

Baylor University had already announced its re-opening schedule, and according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the University of Texas will be making its decision known by the end of June, if not before.

Ron DeSantis Welcomes Sports Back to Florida, Fan Attendance Possible in June","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) has announced that he is allowing some sports to re-start their games in the Sunshine State, adding that fans could repopulate the stands within social distancing guidelines as early as June.

DeSantis particularly addressed pro wrestling with an appeal for the league to consider staging Wrestlemania in Florida.

“I helped recruit,” DeSantis said, according to TMZ Sports. “I wanted the wrestling to be filmed in Orlando. I’d like them to do WrestleMania. They were going to do WrestleMania in April. That was hundreds of millions of dollars. I want to keep that good relationship. I want them to invest in Florida.”

The Republican went on noting that UFC 249 is also scheduled to be held in Florida. “There’s not going to be any fans, but I think that’s going to be a good event for people,” he said.

Moving to golf, DeSantis insisted, “I work with Phil Mickelson, so they have what they need for that Tiger Woods match.”

DeSantis also praised the talk coming out of Major League Baseball that games could be held in Florida as part of a one-year realignment of the leagues.

“I think that’s going to be exciting for a lot of people and I just think there are going to be a lot of possibilities. So, let’s just be resourceful and creative,” he said.

Of course, so far, none of these sports have made any concrete plans to re-start their seasons, but DeSantis wants them to know his state is open for business.

He even thinks the fans will be back as soon as June.

“I do think if the trends are good as you get into June-July. I think there is a window to have some fans. You’re not going to have everyone packed in,” he told the media. “But man, in 90-degree weather in the state of Florida … if you’re out there and someone’s 10 feet away from you and you want to watch a ball game or something? You may be able to do that.”

DeSantis did note that his decisions are “going to be driven by the facts, driven by the data.”

['Haris Alic'],2020-04-30,Megan Rapinoe Fails to Mention Tara Reade in Joe Biden Interview,"Former Vice President Joe Biden faced no questions about the recent sexual assault allegation leveled against him while taking part in a discussion on Thursday with Megan Rapinoe, the star player of the National Women’s Soccer League and a prominent female empowerment advocate.

The conversation, which touched on a multitude of topics including the Biden family’s support for pay equity, took place as the former vice president is being pressured to address the accusations brought forth last month by Tara Reade, his onetime Senate staffer. Reade, who initially came forward in the last year to accuse Biden of unwanted touching and sexual harassment, now claims that he pushed her up against a wall, forcibly kissed her, and digitally penetrated her in 1993.

In recent days, the accusation has catapulted to the media’s attention, after video surfaced of Reade’s mother calling into CNN to discuss her daughter’s “problems” with working for a “prominent senator.” Even though Reade’s mother did not discuss the exact “problems” and opted not to name either her daughter or Biden during the call, a number of media outlets took the opportunity presented by the video to call on the former vice president to address the allegation directly.

“Tara Reade deserves to be heard, and voters deserve to hear her,” The Washington Post’s editorial board wrote on Wednesday. “They deserve to hear from Joe Biden, too.”

Despite such calls, the former vice president has refused to speak out, even as his campaign has begun arming surrogates with talking points about the allegations. Ahead of Thursday’s interview, many hoped that Rapinoe, a strong champion of #MeToo movement and LGBTQ equality, would be able to coax a response.

That feeling was summed up by viewers at the start of interview, many of whom took to the comments section of Biden’s Instagram feed to make it known they wanted him to discus Reade. Rapinoe, however, did not take the bait and neither Reade nor her accusation were brought up.

Not even a few minutes into Megan Rapinoe's interview of the Bidens on Instagram and the comment section already has many mentions of Tara Reade. — Brittany Shepherd (@brittanys) April 30, 2020

The decision was surprising given the stance Rapino has taken in the past against elected officials she believed not to be supportive of women. Most notably last year, the soccer player called out Vice President Mike Pence for refusing to meet alone with female colleagues and subordinates unless his wife was present.

“Well, women are afraid to be raped, sexually assaulted, sexually harassed, kept out of jobs, fired from jobs, moved laterally their entire career,” Rapinoe told CNBC in December 2019 when discussing Pence and other men in high positions of power. “Honestly, I call f—–g b——t on that.”",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/04/30/tara-reade-escapes-mention-during-biden-interview-with-metoo-champion-megan-rapinoe/

The Little League World Series has been held every August since 1947 and has never been canceled. Next year was to be the 75th playing of the tournament; that milestone has been pushed back to 2022.

Keener added that travel restrictions would make it equally impossible to hold qualifying tournaments for international teams and to bring those teams safely to the United States.

[],2020-04-30,NASCAR to Resume Season May 17 with Seven Races in 10 Days,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — NASCAR announced Thursday that it will resume its season without fans starting May 17 at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina with the premier Cup Series racing three more times in a 10-day span.

NASCAR joins the UFC as the first major sports organizations to announce specific return to play plans since the coronavirus pandemic shut down U.S. sports in mid-March.

“NASCAR and its teams are eager and excited to return to racing, and have great respect for the responsibility that comes with a return to competition,” said Steve O’Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer. “NASCAR will return in an environment that will ensure the safety of our competitors, officials and all those in the local community.

NASCAR’s revised schedule goes only through May and has a pair of Wednesday Cup races, fulfilling fans longtime plea for midweek events. The first race is scheduled for Darlington, NASCAR’s oldest superspeedway, followed by a second race at the 70-year-old, egg-shaped oval track three days later.

Charlotte Motor Speedway will then host the Coca-Cola 600 on May 24 to mark 60 consecutive years the longest race on the NASCAR schedule will be held on Memorial Day weekend. The track in Concord, outside NASCAR’s home base of Charlotte, will then host a Wednesday race three days later.

There will also be lower-tier Xfinity and Trucks series races at the two tracks. The North Carolina governor has said the the Charlotte races can be held as long as health conditions in the area do not deteriorate.

“This has been a proactive effort to put our motorsports industry back to work and boost the morale of sports fans around the world, while at the same time keeping the health and safety of all who will be on site the top priority,” said Marcus Smith, president and CEO of Speedway Motorsports. He said “sports fans around the world need this, a return to some sense of normalcy with live sports on TV, and NASCAR is uniquely positioned to deliver it from a competition standpoint.”

NASCAR has set guidelines to safely hold the events using CDC guidelines on social distancing and personal protective equipment. Only essential personnel will be permitted to attend the events, and cloth face masks will be required. The entire venue will be used to maintain distancing in garage stalls and where the haulers are parked.

NASCAR suspended its season March 13 with only four of its 36 scheduled races completed. The stock car series, heavily reliant on television money and sponsor payments, has vowed to complete its full schedule. The revised schedule for now stays at tracks within driving distance of Charlotte-based race teams and in states that have started reopening.

“Darlington is one of the most iconic and historic tracks in the sport and will be a tremendous backdrop when NASCAR returns to racing,” said track President Kerry Tharp, who noted the track will now have three Cup races in one season for the first time in its history.

Darlington is also scheduled to open the playoffs with the Southern 500 on Sept. 6. Because the track now has two additional dates, NASCAR will lose two Cup races from its other properties. The same goes for Speedway Motorsports, which gained one additional race so far and will have to forfeit one at another facility.

Almost all teams began returning to their shops this week with either a reduced initial workforce or in split shifts. Now that NASCAR has told the teams where it will be racing this month, they can start preparing cars suitable for the two tracks.

Although Florida and Texas invited NASCAR to compete in those states without spectators, the sanctioning body is holding off on scheduling events at tracks that require air travel and hotel accommodations.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/04/30/nascar-to-resume-season-may-17-with-seven-races-in-10-days/

“I have to disagree with you sir when you that I’m selfish [for re-opening the salon].” Salon Á la Mode owner Shelly Luther told Judge Eric Moyé during a contempt of court proceeding broadcast on the internet and tweeted by CBSDFW reporter Andrea Lucia, “because feeding my kids is not selfish.”

The judge told Shelley Luther she

could avoid jail time if she apologized, admitted she was wrong, and agreed to close her hair salon until it was allowed to open. This is her response…@CBSDFW pic.twitter.com/1phdNUsLme — Andrea Lucia (@CBS11Andrea) May 5, 2020

Judge Eric Moyé presides over the 14th Civil District Court located in Dallas County. Dallas County issued an order to Luther requiring her to close her business after she opened in defiance of the stay at home Coronavirus lockdown.

Luther told the judge, “I have hairstylists that are going hungry because they’d rather feed their kids. So, sir, if you think the law is more important than kids getting fed then please go ahead with your decision but I am not going to shut the salon.”

Prior to her statement, Judge Moyé said she must see the errors of her ways and “understand that the society cannot function where one’s own belief in a concept of liberty permits you to flaunt your disdain for the rulings of duly elected officials.”

“That you owe an apology to the elected officials who you disrespected by flagrantly ignoring, and in one case defiling, their orders you now know obviously apply to you,” Moyé lectured. “That you understand that the proper way in which an ordered society to engage concerns that you might have had is to hire a lawyer and advocate for change an exception or an amendment to laws that you find offensive.”

Lucia reported that the judge ordered her jailed for seven days and fined $500 for every day the salon remains open. So far, the fine stands at $3,500.

Luther’s attorney said he would appeal the judge’s ruling.

The contempt hearing occurred at about the time Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced that hair salons and gyms could re-open on Friday.

The two vehicles were set on fire and destroyed in the commune of Bouguenais near Nantes at around 1 am on Saturday while they were parked outside a local mail sorting centre.

Police found the letters “ADA” spraypainted nearby, the acronym for the far-left Antifa groups Action Directe Anarchiste which took credit for the destruction on their website, broadcaster franceinfo reports.

Andy Ngo: Media's Selective Lockdown Protest Coverage 'Empowers' Antifa Violence https://t.co/30FaaA2SBu — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020

According to the broadcaster, the group quoted Russian anarchist philosopher Mikhail Alexandrovich Bakunin, a leading figure in anarchist thought and one of the founders of anarcho-socialism.

Conservative newspaper Valeurs Actuelles published an excerpt of the post which claimed La Poste collaborates with the French state to help expel illegal migrants, “pressures and threatens” its employees to work during the coronavirus pandemic, and criticised La Banque Postale, a banking subsidiary of La Poste.

La Poste, meanwhile, has stated that the destruction of the vehicles will not impact deliveries of mail to locals and said it would be filing a complaint with police.

The violence comes just days after French police arrested two Antifa anarchist extremists who they say were both armed and were plotting to kill police officers.

In neighbouring Germany, Antifa extremists are also thought to have been behind the brutal beating of a camera crew belong to the satirical television programme Heute Show (Today Show) on International Workers’ Day in the German capital of Berlin.

['Thomas D. Williams'],2020-05-05,Historian: Controllable Pandemic Now ‘Unnecessary Pandemonium’,"Prof. John Rao of St. John’s University in New York City has come out swinging against the “fraudulent” experts who counseled the shuttering of the world “for the sake of creating an antiseptic, barren, soulless world unfit for human beings to live in.”

In his May 4 message, the Oxford-educated Dr. Rao writes that “a controllable pandemic has been transformed into a totally unnecessary pandemonium,” allowing “a painfully hollow modern society to titillate itself with the ‘feel’ of living through the Bubonic Plague without actually doing so.”

“I do not feel competent to discuss the initial cause of a disease that has affected the entire globe, nor would I in any way wish to minimize the real suffering and loss that this malady has entailed for many people,” Rao acknowledges.

That being said, “the reasoning man does not have to be an expert in a given field to be able to make a competent judgment regarding whether he is dealing with leaders whose advice he should heed or reject as fraudulent,” he notes.

When experts “tell young or otherwise healthy persons that they are in the same condition as the weakest of the elderly or the already ill; when they say that in order to protect itself the vast mass of the population has to abandon its livelihood, the well-being of its country, the cultural life of its civilization, and the tools required for its eternal salvation they must be dismissed for what they actually are: quacks,” he writes.

According to Rao, today we find ourselves “at the mercy of well-educated, possibly well-meaning, but ultimately highly dangerous and arrogant guides of this sort.”

“These Masters of Them That Know are pressing us to destroy everything that we hold dear for the sake of creating an antiseptic, barren, soulless world unfit for human beings to live in — and die in — with dignity,” he contends.

For their part, the media have whipped the world “into a state of mass hysteria and terrorized paralysis” accompanied “by a political establishment that permits the cowed masses to venture forth from their cells only under the condition of donning the current yellow Star of David: the face mask.”

The “apparatchiks of the wretched ‘New Normal’ have popularized a fresh farewell greeting that one encounters everywhere when venturing forth wearing the Mask of Oppression: ‘stay safe.’”

If we retreat into our “castles” it should only be “to steel ourselves spiritually and intellectually to muster the courage needed to contradict the arrogant but confident authorities mandating the ‘New Normal,’” he concludes.

['Victoria Friedman'],2020-05-05,Just 273 out of 18.1m People Entering UK Before Lockdown Quarantined,"The government’s Home Office formally quarantined just 273 people out of the 18.1 million arrivals by air, land, and sea to the UK in the three months leading up to March’s coronavirus lockdown.

The figures show that between January 1st and March 22nd, 2020, a combined 241 people on three evacuation flights from Wuhan — understood to be the origin of the Chinese virus — and 32 individuals flown from Tokyo, after being transferred from the infected Diamond Princess cruise ship, were sent to various quarantining facilities across the country.

The Guardian reports that it understands the Home Office estimates that of the more than 18 million people who entered at that time, tens of thousands had come from high-infection areas without quarantine, testing, or social distancing.

Home secretary Priti Patel has said that the UK’s refusal to shut down the country’s external borders was based on advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). However, Labour MP and member of the Home Affairs Select Committee Stephen Doughty questioned: “On what scientific basis were a handful of flights from Wuhan and one from a Tokyo singled out for extreme attention? But not a single flight from Northern Italy, Spain or the U.S.?”

Mr Doughty added that the fact that arrivals from high-infection areas may have continued to travel around the UK with “little or no adherence to social distancing, and with no checks or protections at the border” was “deeply disturbing”.

“Yet arrivals continue to this day — with no formal quarantine requirements. It is simply staggering,” he added.

While airline passengers are down 99 per cent on this time last year, some 100,000 people a week — 15,000 a day — continue to arrive into the UK without restriction. Passengers have accused airlines like British Airways of still letting too many people on aeroplanes, making social distancing impossible.

Coronavirus: International Flights Continue to Bring 100,000 Unchecked Travellers a Week to Britain https://t.co/k1QQsDfzHy — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 17, 2020

Last month, reports suggested that the UK would introduce some kind of two-week ‘stay-at-home’ order for arrivals — a far cry from Singapore’s and Australia’s enforced quarantine, with government-chartered coaches picking up passengers by the plane-load and transporting them to hotels where they are instructed to remain in their rooms for 14 days.

Transport secretary Grant Shapps said this week that the government is considering the self-isolation orders, but only after the UK has got the current wave of coronavirus under control to prevent a second wave. That means that whilst Britons remain in lockdown in their own homes, thousands continue to enter the country without restriction every day.

The chief of Heathrow Airport last month called for the Home Office to conduct mass screenings of all new arrivals. However, procedures like temperature checks can only indicate infection for those that are symptomatic, but it can take between one and 14 days for symptoms of the Chinese virus to manifest.

While more than 100 countries worldwide have imposed some kind of travel restriction, the UK has enacted none, making it “an outlier”, according to Professor Gabriel Scally, the Royal Society of Medicine’s president of epidemiology and public health.

“It is very hard to understand why it persists in having this open borders policy. It is most peculiar,” Prof Scally said in comments reported by the Financial Times last month.

“Travel restriction by itself is of course not going to do the job. But all of these things are additive. It all adds up to beating the virus,” he added.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/05/05/just-273-18-1m-people-entering-uk-before-lockdown-were-quarantined/

Agents assigned to the Javier Vega, Jr. Immigration Checkpoint on U.S. Highway 77 observed a semi-tractor/trailer rig approaching for inspection. During an initial interview, a K-9 agent alerted to an odor near the trailer it is trained to detect, according to Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials. The agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station.

During a physical search of the trailer, agents found 36 bundles of suspected drugs hidden among the cargo. Officials report the drugs tested positive for cocaine and weighed more than 92 pounds. They estimated the value of the cocaine to be $2.9 million.

The agents arrested the driver and seized the drugs. Both were turned over to Drug Enforcement Administration special agents for further investigation and possible prosecution for drug trafficking.

“Even with the spread of the COVID-19 virus, human smugglers continue to try these brazen attempts with zero regard for the lives they endanger nor to the health of the citizens of our great nation,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials said in a written statement. “The U.S. Border Patrol agents of the Rio Grande Valley Sector will continue to safeguard the nation and community against these criminal elements.”

The checkpoint is named after slain Border Patrol Agent Javier Vega, Jr. who was killed by an illegal alien, Breitbart Texas reported.

However, after an intense campaign and support from U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), then Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan later reclassified the murder as a line-of-duty death providing benefits to his family.

['James Delingpole'],2020-05-05,The SAGE Committee Running Britain Is More Corbyn Than Boris,"Finally, the UK government has published the names of the people on the committee running — or should that be ruining? — Britain.

The SAGE committee — it stands for Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies — is responsible for the scientific advice underpinning the interminable lockdown.

It is therefore arguably more powerful than the Cabinet or even the prime minister himself because on its advice everything from the future of the UK economy to the freedoms of the British people currently depend.

How extraordinary, then, that for two months the British should have been kept in the dark about the identities of the people running their lives!

One of the reasons given for the secrecy up till now is that the scientists need to remain anonymous to preserve their safety — perhaps from angry mobs turning up on their doorstep with pitchforks to protest about the lost livelihoods and businesses which are one of the likely consequences of the measures that have been taken by the government on the SAGE committee’s advice.

But surely against that small risk must be set the public’s right to know just which people are responsible for the draconian rules now governing their lives.

We know the names of the Cabinet – and they are accountable for their decisions.

The same ought surely to apply to the SAGE committee’s membership. Otherwise we might feel inclined to believe that the government is treating us like children or – worse – selling us a false prospectus.

One obvious concern is the presence on the committee of Neil Ferguson, author of the dubious Imperial College study that prompted the lockdown.

As has since emerged, Ferguson is the author of several discredited modelling studies going back to 2001 when he was partly responsible for Britain’s bad mishandling of Foot and Mouth which resulted in the needless slaughter of millions of healthy animals.

People with a track record like this hardly deserve the protection of anonymity.

The full list comprises 50 names, plus two participants who have ‘not given permission to be named’. You can fairly safely assume that few if any of those names are sympathetic to notions like small government, liberty, free markets — or conservatism generally. This is partly a function of the left-wing bias which has long since infected most of academe; partly a reflection of the way the administrative state now works.

[In an early version of this piece, I mistakenly conflated an ‘Alternative SAGE committee’ created by the former Chief Scientist David King – and chock full of loony leftists – with the real one. But though King’s alternative committee is undoubtedly more hard-left than the official one, I think we can still safely say that almost no one on the SAGE committee would have voted either for Boris Johnson or for Brexit. It is the Deep State in excelsis]

For example, eight of the names work either for the National Health Service or for Public Health England, both manifestations of the Deep State blob which was co-opted long ago by the left. Certainly, their political sympathies would be a lot more in tune with Jeremy Corbyn than Boris Johnson.

This rather invites the question: what was the point of voting Conservative in the last general election if the end result was for the country to be run by a committee largely comprising Corbynistas, Remainers, and other left-leaning ideologues?

And why isn’t the mainstream media kicking up more of a fuss about this grotesque betrayal of democracy?

I can answer the second question. It’s because the mainstream media — itself riddled with left-wing bias and taking its cue from the BBC — has decided that the real scandal is that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s senior advisor, has been sitting on the SAGE committee and bringing his influence to bear on it.

This seems to me — as indeed it is — a complete non-story. It entirely makes sense for any government to have its advisors sitting on scientific committees: they’re supposed to be scientists, after all, not members of the government — so there needs to be an interface between the two.

A more pertinent question, where Cummings is concerned though is: what the hell are you playing at, Dom?

Cummings, it will be remembered, was the reforming radical who was going to keep Boris Johnson’s administration honest by rolling back the Deep State and finally bringing the sclerotic, incompetent, left-leaning Civil Service into the 21st century.

Instead, it would appear, Cummings has allowed the Deep State to make all the running — to the point where it is now in charge of the country.

This cannot end well for the government, the economy, or the British people. Nor will it.

['Victoria Friedman'],2020-05-05,"UK-U.S. Trade Negotiations Begin, Scots Europhiles Demand Brexit Delay","After Theresa May’s Brexit delays and the coronavirus lockdown, the long-awaited UK-U.S. trade talks began on Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump supported the UK’s vote to leave the EU and from early on in his presidency, pushing for a “massive new trade deal” between his country and the United Kingdom.

While Britons voted to leave the EU on June 23rd, 2016, then-Prime Minister Theresa May did not trigger Article 50 — the legal mechanism for leaving the EU — until March 2017 and then delayed the country’s exit twice. A further delay forced on her successor Boris Johnson pushed Brexit until January 31st, 2020. Before that official exit date, the UK was not allowed to begin formal free trade negotiations with other countries.

Even during the current transition period, the UK may negotiate but cannot activate new trade deals until she is finally out of the EU’s institutions on January 1st, 2021.

Politico reported on Monday that talks between British and American negotiators would begin today, albeit virtually through video conferencing due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss will hold a video call with her American counterpart, Robert Lighthizer, with around 100 negotiators from both sides of the pond listening in.

Ms Truss has said that it was “essential” to strike a good deal with the United States to ease the economic burden caused by the lockdown, with ministers believing that a UK-U.S. deal could provide a £15 billion boost to the British economy.

This first round of talks is expected to last two weeks, with further rounds every six weeks. Both countries hope to lower tariffs on their goods being shipped abroad, with the UK hoping for concessions on cars, ceramics, and foods, to make agreements on financial services and data, and to forge deals beneficial to Britain’s small businesses.

The British also hope to use progress on a U.S. trade deal to put pressure on the EU, which is demanding the UK maintain regulatory alignment with the bloc and the continued surrender of her territorial fishing waters.

Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party’s (SNP) Westminster leader Ian Blackford has become the latest Remainer to call for the transition period, which ends on December 31st, to be extended for another two years because of coronavirus.

In a letter to party leaders and reported by The Herald, Mr Blackford wrote: “The ongoing emergency caused by the Covid-19 virus is, and must remain, the sole focus of our collective efforts, and it is right that all other political agendas are paused as we deal with the priority of saving lives and protecting people’s incomes.

“In that context, I believe now is the right moment to unite as opposition parties in Westminster in seeking a two-year extension to the Brexit transition period.

“That strong, united opposition stance would also send a powerful message to our European friends and partners, who we know are favourable to the logic and sense of this request.”

However, diplomatic sources in the EU speaking to The Times last month said that several European countries admitted that it would not make sense for the UK to extend the transition period. They added that any alleged economic impact of leaving the bloc’s institutions, notably, without a trade deal, would be absorbed by the global financial repercussions caused by the Chinese virus.

The British government has maintained that it will not extend the transition period; doing so would threaten the progress of any future free trade agreements with countries like the U.S., Australia, or New Zealand. Senior minister Michael Gove told the House of Commons on Monday that the path of not extending is “plain prudence”. He warned that to “perpetuate our membership of the European Union-lite through the transition period” would result in having to spend more taxpayers’ money.",breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/05/05/uk-u-s-trade-negotiations-begin-as-europhiles-demand-brexit-delay/
['David Ng'],2020-05-05,Bette Midler: ‘Trump Is Killing His Own Base’,"Actress Bette Midler is accusing President Donald Trump of killing his voter base of “older white men and women,” adding that the president doesn’t care about the fate of the elderly.

The Beaches star made the allegation despite the fact that President Trump has stated that he wants special care given to senior citizens as states move to re-open their economies in the wake of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Bette Mider, who is white and 74, tweeted her bizarre claim late Monday in what appeared to be a reference to President Trump’s efforts to re-start the U.S. economy after many states have successfully seen the number of coronavirus cases flatten in recent days.

“Trump is killing his own base, older white men and women! It is beyond belief. And he doesn’t care!!” Midler said.

Midler omitted the fact that President Trump has emphasized that he wants states to safely re-open businesses and schools, with special attention paid to the well-being of the elderly.

“States are safely coming back. Our Country is starting to OPEN FOR BUSINESS again,” Trump tweeted last month. “Special care is, and always will be, given to our beloved seniors (except me!). Their lives will be better than ever…WE LOVE YOU ALL!”

Along with a growing list of other celebrities, Bette Midler has blamed President Trump for U.S. coroanvirus deaths, claiming last month that the president has “30,000 corpses” on his hands.

“Every single day you cause death, destruction, and untold suffering. Four more years of your incompetence and we won’t have a country left!” Midler tweeted, adding the hashtags #TrumpOwnsEveryDeath and #Loser.

['David Ng'],2020-05-04,Cher Explains Biden Support: ‘Vote for the One Side You Hate Least’,"It’s not exactly a ringing endorsement but pop icon Cher has laid out some reasoning as to why she is voting for Joe Biden: “You have to vote for the one side you hate the least.”

Cher said in an interview with Billboard that she sees Joe Biden as an “honest” man while she continues to vehemently dislike President Donald Trump.

“I like Joe. I’ve known Joe for a long, long, long time,” the Oscar-winning star said. “I had a meeting once with him and I thought, ‘You know what? This is an honest man.’ It was way before he was with Barack Obama. We had a conversation and he was so painfully honest.”

Cher admitted that Biden is a flawed candidate, but she didn’t elaborate.

“You know, everybody’s got faults,” Cher said. “But at least he has a soul and he understands pain. He’s also been a politician for a gazillion years. I think he still has got it or I wouldn’t vote. I’m actually registered as an independent. It means I don’t agree with everybody, but in the final analysis, you have to vote for the one side you hate the least.”

Neither Cher nor Billboard magazine mentioned Tara Reade, the former Senate staffer who has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her nearly thirty years ago. Biden avoided discussing the matter for weeks until last week when he denied the allegation on MSNBC.

As for President Trump, the Hollywood actress-singer said she continues to loath him.

“As much as I dislike Trump — and dislike doesn’t even come anywhere near to what I feel about him — if I thought that he was really interested in people and came up with something to help, I would give him some props, even though I think he would have nothing to do with it. If his administration would start saving lives, I’d back off for awhile.”

Cher also had words of praise for Hillary Clinton and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

“I’ve known Hillary for quite a long time,” the actress said. “She’s smart, inquisitive, always learning and tough as nails. She knows more about government than most presidents. But she’s also kind of a girly girl, too.”

She also praised Ocasio-Cortez’s far-left agenda. “That kind of activism is what’s necessary,” Cher said, but added: “Going left is fine, but it has to be in degrees so that the people who are centrist can think that sounds good or it isn’t so radical. We have to bring everybody along and not drag or pull them along. ”

“In the fog of conflicting information the reality is that we are numbing people to basically accept that 3000 people will die every day from June onwards?” tweeted Handler of the Wuhan coronavirus.

The Totally High actress went on to claim that 3,000 people dying each day in America is only “fathomable” because of “Republicans.”

“How is this even fathomable? Republicans,” said Handler. It turns out, Handler was pushing a Times story that’s received wholesale pushback by the White House.

“This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting,” said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere. “This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed.”

Last month, Handler praised coronavirus lockdowns — not because she thinks they stop the spread of the Chinese virus — but because she believes they prevent school shootings, given that lockdowns have caused school closures and remote, off-campus learning.

Handler suggested that it took lockdowns for the United States to be able to go through the month of March without a school shooting since 2002.

“It took all schools to be closed and everyone forced to be inside because of a pandemic, but we finally did it,” she added.

The comedian, however, had failed to acknowledge that March 2020 also experienced more firearm background checks than anytime on record.

Handler has also joined the left-wing media’s attempts to block the public from being able to see parts — or all — of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus briefings by claiming that the media should consider suspending coverage of the daily White House event.

Handler implored the media to ask themselves whether or not they believe it is “responsible,” “ethical,” or safe for news organizations to continue to broadcast the latest updates from the president regarding the deadly Chinese coronavirus.

The Chinese coronavirus — also known as COVID-19 — which originated from Wuhan, China has killed 68,387 people in the United States as of Monday, according to the latest data provided by Johns Hopkins University at the time of publishing.

Judd Apatow didn’t call President Trump and Republicans murders, but, or course, he hasn’t hesitated to do so like so many other Hollywood leftists.

They are all murderers.”

This from the 40 Year Old Virgin director who has said Trump is both a terrorist and a Nazi.

I know him, and Crazy Mika well used them beautifully in the last Election, dumped them nicely, and will state on the record that he is ‘nuts’. Besides, bad ratings! #OPENJOECOLDCASE.”

Trump’s tweet was referring to the case of Lori Klausutis, then-Congressman Scarborough’s 28-year-old congressional intern, who was found dead in Scarborough’s Fort Walton Beach, Florida, office back in 2001.

['Bukola Adebayo'],2020-04-30,"WHO investigating reported increase in deaths in Kano, Nigeria, governor says","Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) The World Health Organization and health officials in the northern Nigerian state of Kano have launched a probe into reports of increases in unusual deaths, state Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje told CNN.

A team of experts is gathering hospital records and interviewing families of those who died at home to determine the actual cause of death.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has also ordered a 14-day lockdown in Kano following the reported spike in deaths.

Buhari said the government will deploy all ""human, material and technical"" assistance to contain the coronavirus in the state, and a team has been sent to investigate.

Preliminary investigations by the state ministry of health suggest that the increase in mortality was not unusual compared to other years, Ganduje said.

Still, officials are interviewing cemetery workers, checking hospital records and asking residents about family members who died at home, the governor said.

State officials had earlier said the ""mysterious deaths"" were not Covid-related and attributed the deaths to meningitis, diabetes, hypertension, and other illnesses, even though no autopsies have not been done.

Kano isn't the only place to see an increase in deaths.

A Yale School of Public Health team, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, found about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19.

A spike in deaths

A gravedigger, Kabiru Nasidi Sabon-Sara, who has worked at the Dandolo Cemetery in Kano city for over 30 years, told CNN funerals carried out at the graveyard have doubled.

Sabon-Sara said he began noticing the spike in deaths a day before Ramadan, and numbers have continued to rise since state authorities imposed a lockdown to curb a spread of the virus.

""In Dandolo we get between 35 to 40 burials, and it used to be less than that, between 13 to 15 at most in a day,"" Sabon-Sara said.

He said one of the diggers who joined a funeral procession died, and some other diggers have been ill.

""We don't have anything to protect ourselves. Our colleagues are falling sick. We need assistance from the government,"" Sabon-Sara told CNN.

Health workers faced a challenge in determining whether the deaths were coronavirus-related: the state's testing laboratory was not working at the time, Ganduje said. That made it difficult for health workers to collect samples for testing.

Older patients affected

Dr. Abubabar Nagoma, president of the Kano association of resident doctors who works at the government-owned Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, said there has been a rise in deaths among elderly patients in the state in recent weeks.

He said while some had underlying illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and previous strokes, they also had respiratory problems -- increasing concerns that they might have been coronavirus-related deaths.

""We're raising the high index of suspicion because of the age of some of the patients that died and the symptoms they experienced,"" Nagoma told CNN.

""We can't say the deaths are unconnected to the pandemic, and we can't say for sure it's Covid-19.""

Dr. Nura Abubakar of Kano's Medical Association said the lack of data about the situation during a pandemic has sparked speculation. Only a thorough probe could help put an end to it, Abubakar said.

""I know a woman who had breast cancer that died over the weekend,"" Abubakar said. ""We can say she succumbed to the illness, and we can't say she died of Covid-19 because she was not tested for the virus.""

Looming epidemic

The NCDC announced Tuesday that it had reopened the lab and planned to set up another testing center, but the delay and news of people dying had sparked concerns that the virus was spreading undetected in the state.

The unconfirmed ""mysterious deaths"" have caused some apprehension among residents who are demanding answers, Maulid Warfa, head of the UNICEF office in Kano told CNN.

Warfa said Kano had been battling other public health concerns, including high infant and maternal death rates, before the pandemic and it lacked the capacity to carry out enough tests to give a true picture of the situation.

""Kano only got its first laboratory about two weeks ago, and immediately that testing started, the numbers started jumping,"" he said.",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/africa/who-probe-nigeria-deaths/index.html

"['David Mckenzie', 'Brent Swails']",2020-04-29,South Africa's painful past HIV failures is helping the country to fight Covid-19,"Thokoza, South Africa (CNN) When President Donald Trump mused recently about injecting household disinfectants as treatment for Covid-19 in the White House briefing room, South Africans were reminded of their own dark past.

Two decades ago, the country's health minister announced that beetroot or garlic could treat HIV/AIDS.

In all, South Africa's official AIDS denials and misinformation cost the lives of more than 300,000 people, according to several studies.

""We can't have a large number of people dying,"" Dr. Yogan Pillay, a senior official at the Department of Health, said. ""We came from a period where we had large numbers of South Africans dying from HIV. We can't repeat that now and we shouldn't.""

An ambitious initiative

It is the memory of that past failure, South African health officials say, that is driving their fight against this new virus and it is the considerable resources they have since built up against HIV, that could provide their best weapon in fighting Covid-19.

After years of dithering under Mbeki, the South African government drastically changed course against HIV because of civil society lawsuits and a change in leadership.

They put millions of people on ARVs and recruited an army of community health workers to inform the public of the dangers of AIDS and the importance of testing.

They were able to mount this fight, in large part, because of an ambitious initiative launched by another US Republican president.

Former President George W. Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), announced in 2003, is arguably the single most successful international US public health response.

More than 14 million people are on ARVs because of PEPFAR. When it began, fewer than 50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa could access the life-sustaining drugs.

""Quite frankly, without the PEPFAR investment in South Africa, we wouldn't have more than a million people on treatment, a significant reduction in the number of deaths from HIV and TB, or the significant increase in our life expectancy,"" Dr. Pillay said.

Pillay said that there are currently roughly eight million HIV positive people in South Africa, with more than two million infected people not on antiretrovirals.

A sweeping lockdown

Those numbers mean that South Africa has the world's largest HIV burden, which helped to convince South African scientists and officials to recommend a sweeping lockdown as Covid-19 struck the country.

Countries around the world are under lockdown, but South Africa's is one of the strictest and it was instituted before a single confirmed Covid-19 death and in a country already in an economic recession.

""This was a very tough decision for the government to take,"" Dr. Pillay said, ""but they took it because they didn't want to repeat the mistakes of ... our early response to HIV.""

In a middle-income country with the world's greatest levels of inequality , South Africa has managed to drastically flatten its infection curve early while much richer countries like the UK and the United States have struggled to do so.

South Africa has distinct disadvantages to those wealthy nations. Millions live in townships and informal settlements across the country where the lockdowns make sense in principle, but not really in practice.

Townships like Thokoza, in the southeast of Johannesburg, are a nightmare scenario for combating a respiratory disease.

But here, too, the country's experience with HIV is helping its battle.

Thousands of health workers are targeting townships and informal settlements throughout South Africa.

Around 35,000 government and PEPFAR supported health workers are now actively screening for the disease in communities they already work, conducting routine health checks, according to Pillay.

They have already screened nearly six million people for Covid-19, according to the latest figures from the country's Department of Health.

Community health worker Anito Pato said that the trust she has built up with the community allows her to address fear of the new virus right away. She goes door-to-door in Thokoza to check for symptoms of Covid-19 and refer the sick for testing.

""They didn't know much about Covid-19 and they think it is affecting the rich people, not them,"" Pato said. ""We try to explain to them why we are screening and what corona is.""

Anita Pato has been working as a community health worker for more than 10 years.

A man in a blue work shirt called Pato over during her visit. He wanted a test. Pato explained that there aren't enough tests right now and that he should go to the clinic or the mobile testing center they have set up if he gets the symptoms.

""AIDS is better because we have got treatment,"" the man, Salvin Tawananda, told CNN, ""But corona, people are just scared.""

The government and US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are closely monitoring efforts in Thokoza and other townships, where social distancing is all but impossible, and failure could be disastrous.

""It is very hard for people here to adhere to those lockdown rules and that is even more reason why we should be out there looking for the disease before it takes over these communities,"" said Dr. Meredith McMorrow, a CDC official based in South Africa.

""South Africa was certainly the hardest hit by HIV and it concerns us that it will be the hardest hit by Covid-19 as well that is why we are doing everything we can to get ready right now.""

Covid-19's effect on HIV patients

McMorrow's concern comes from not yet knowing Covid-19's effects on HIV positive people.

To date, studies in China and elsewhere are inconclusive, but Megan Doherty, the head of the WHO's global HIV program, said it pays to be extremely cautious with any emerging disease.

""Because this is an unprecedented pandemic, we just don't know how it reacts in all situations,"" she said. ""We just don't know enough about the interactions between HIV and Covid-19 and how patients with both infections will do.""

ARVs are being tested as possible therapeutics for COVID-19 in clinical trials.

Dr. Larry Corey, now president and director emeritus of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, helped develop the first effective ARV treatment.

He said he is skeptical that ARVs designed for HIV will become a broad-based treatment for Covid-19.

""The best ARVs that are discovered are highly specific to each virus,"" he said.

Corey, who now leads the global HIV-vaccine trial network, said regardless of the results of ARV trials in Covid-19 treatment, South Africa is well placed to play a critical part in the next phase of this pandemic, because of its HIV infrastructure and experience with HIV vaccine trials.

The Infection numbersacross the continent, while significantly lower than other parts of the world, are rising exponentially. The World Health Organization recently reported that the number of cases in Africa was now more than 11,000, with 600 deaths.

The pandemic has overwhelmed advanced health facilities, and experts predict it could devastate the continent's fragile health systems, already plagued by inadequate funding and labor disputes.

Lifesaving machines like ventilators -- critical to the management of Covid-19 cases -- remain a luxury in some African countries.

The Central African Republic (CAR) has only three ventilators to five million people, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said, warning that an outbreak could bring the tiny African nation to its knees.

""When rich nations are in panic mode stating that thousands of ventilators will not be enough, it just brings to light how poorer nations like CAR don't stand a chance in the fight against Covid-19,"" NRC Country Director in the CAR, David Manan said.

The situation is equally dire in Zimbabwe, where health workers in the nation's hospitals say they lack basics such as bandages and gloves to take care of their patients.

Nurses and doctors abstained from work to protest a shortage of coronavirus protective gear after the country recorded its first fatality last month.

Ugandan popstar-turned-politician Bobi Wine told CNN the healthcare system in many African countries cannot handle a mass outbreak of Covid-19.

""I need to remind people that the coronavirus is more serious than they are already taking it. It is killing people in big numbers in Italy where there is a super health care system. So it scares me to even imagine what it can do in Africa if it comes in full effect,"" Wine said.

Wine said health care funding has not been at the forefront of government spending in many African countries because their leaders often seek treatment in hospitals abroad.

""It's clear that healthcare is not a priority for many African governments, and they put very little money into that sector. Anytime they are sick, or their children are having health conditions, they opt to go outside their countries,"" Wine said.

""Now the coronavirus pandemic has set a different ground for many African leaders. It has shown that they should have invested in the healthcare system of their countries which would have benefited them and the people in this crisis.""

The lawmaker says monies spent on medical trips abroad could have been used to equip local hospitals with modern medical equipment such as ventilators, which have proved critical in treating some patients who have developed respiratory illnesses because of Covid-19.

Wine said some public hospitals in Uganda had become ""death traps"" due to years of neglect, and some citizens, including himself, have had to pay prohibitive costs for overseas treatment that could have been cheaper in Uganda.

Between 2019 and 2020, Uganda spent 8.9 percent of its national budget on health down from 9.2 percent from the previous fiscal year, according to UNICEF.

""I have had to spend my funds to seek advance treatment abroad because the procedure could not be provided in this country. But a majority of leaders in Uganda travel abroad for minor care using taxpayers money,"" Wine said.

But Uganda's health minister Jane Aceng told CNN Wine's assessment of the country's health system was not accurate.

""Uganda is doing well and that shows with our response to the coronavirus situation. We're doing well,"" she said.

Aceng added that she had all the resources needed to do her job.

The East African nation was one of the first African countries to impose travel and strict quarantine policies to prevent the spread of coronavirus even before it reported a case. It has so far reported 53 cases

A failed pledge

African leaders have consistently neglected their country's health sector despite several pledges to do improve it, analysts say.

In 2001, the heads of state of 52 African countries met in Nigeria's capital, Abuja and committed to spending 15 percent of their yearly domestic budget on health.

Just a handful of countries have met this target on the continent. They include Tanzania , Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia, according to the WHO.

Rwanda doubled it's health care spending over a period of 10 years, the WHO said in the 2017 report. The Central African nation has also received praised for its national health insurance coverage which is the highest on the continent

But a majority have fallen through the cracks in fulfilling this commitment.

Since it signed the declaration, Nigeria has allocated less than six percent of its budget to health, and most of the funds are spent on salaries, according to Nigeria-based budget monitoring organization Budgit

In a paper published by the Brookings Institute , researchers said although Africa bore 23 percent of the world's disease burden in 2015, it accounted for only one percent of the global health spending for the same year.

""In per capita terms, the rest of the world spends 10 times more on health care than Africa,"" the researchers said.

The researchers predict it may be difficult for the countries on the continent to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with a 2030 deadline with the ""current spending environment.""

Wake-up call

Nigerian-British historian Ed Keazor agrees that the fallout from the outbreak is a ""wake-up call"" for governments to prioritize affordable health care.

Keazor, a cancer survivor said he made the difficult decision to move back to London where he has access to affordable care under the National Health Service even though he works in Nigeria.

The filmmaker said he came to Lagos for a research and film festival in March but got caught in the city after the Nigerian government banned all international flights to contain the spread of the outbreak.

Keazor says he's missed an appointment with his doctor in the UK due to the travel restriction, and that would not have been a problem if he could get the same quality of care locally.

""If I could get the same quality of care here (Nigeria) as in the UK where I'm a taxpayer and getting good medical services, I would rather stay back here because this is where my work and my larger family is but unfortunately, its not there,"" Keazor told CNN.

For now, he hopes the health crisis will change the Nigerian government's focus to where he says it should be.

""I hope the enormity of this problem has brought home the urgency of investment in health care infrastructure to the government and whatever the country looks like after this crisis is over, our priorities will be focused on heath care and education,"" he said.",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/africa/african-leaders-healthcare-coronavirus-intl/index.html

['Aisha Salaudeen'],2020-04-17,Nigerian tailors are hand-making PPE to help fight coronavirus,"(CNN) As the world experiences a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic , tailors in Nigeria are responding by hand-making equipment like overalls and face masks.

Rising demand, panic buying, hoarding, and misuse have disrupted the global supply of PPE, according to the World Health Organization , putting lives at risk.

Now, tailors in Abia state, in the southeast of the country, are using local fabrics, cotton, and polypropylene to sew PPE for people looking to protect themselves.

With cases of Covid-19 rising in Nigeria , the Abia state government released a 12 million naira (about $31,000) grant to support tailors to make the protective gear.

The grant was disbursed to 100 selected tailors at the start of April to help them buy additional equipment, source materials and employ more people, according to Sam Hart, the director-general of the Abia State Marketing and Quality Management Agency.

Hart explained that the initial face mask samples were examined by a team of medical experts and that the gear is intended for citizens looking for protection, rather than for health workers.

Local solution

So far, tailors in Aba, the state's commercial nerve center, have produced 200,000 face masks and 3,000 overalls, the agency said.

One of the tailors, Queen Duruibe, told CNN that the overalls she makes are waterproof and puncture-resistant, and are made from a polyamide fabric coated with protective materials.

Her face masks are made with cotton and polypropylene and are hypoallergenic, she said. She also produces decorative face masks made from a colorful print fabric, which aren't intended to protect from coronavirus.

Duruibe had been producing face masks since January but says she has now taken on more staff and converted her fashion store to make up to 10,000 masks per day.

Queen Duruibe runs her own fashion store in Aba.

""I sew different types of clothes here in Aba and I usually buy my materials from China,"" she said. ""But when coronavirus happened, they (her suppliers) started telling me how bad things are, that there are no materials and face masks are scarce.

""So I thought to myself that if things are so scarce, I can actually start producing them myself.""

Finding buyers

The equipment produced by the tailors is sold for around 200 naira (roughly 50 cents), according to Hart, and it is finding a range of buyers.

""We had a pharmacist who bought 10,000 pieces to stock in his pharmacy for sale,"" he said. ""The PPE overalls and face masks have been made available to the public -- anybody can order. We even have some Nigerians in the diaspora who have made bulk orders for their communities and villages here in Abia.""

Tailors say the overalls they make are water and puncture proof.

The state government has also ordered masks, which it will distribute to the most vulnerable citizens, according to John Okiyi, the state commissioner for communications.

""65,000 of these facemasks have already been distributed in some local governments through churches and mosques,"" he told CNN. ""The government has also ordered the production of an additional 150,000 face masks for further distribution.""

He added that the state government has distributed N95 face masks to health workers, because those are more suited to medical professionals.

Beating coronavirus

Abia currently has no confirmed cases of coronavirus, but there have been more than 400 cases in Nigeria. The country has put in place travel restrictions to control the spread of the virus, and all international airports and land borders have been closed

Three of Nigeria's 36 states -- Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja -- have imposed an extended lockdown that began on March 30. Abia state is also on a self-imposed lockdown.

Duruibe, like many of the other tailors, says she is happy to help control the spread of Covid-19. ""For me, I am doing my part in any way I can to aid those fighting the coronavirus pandemic,"" she said.",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/17/africa/hand-made-coronavirus-kits-nigeria-spc/index.html
['Zaina Adamu'],2020-04-08,"Ghana's lavish funerals can last up to seven days. Now, a centuries-old tradition has gone online","Accra, Ghana (CNN) Funerals are a big deal in Ghana and it is not uncommon, in some parts, for a ceremony to last up to seven days, drawing thousands of crowds adorned in flowing red and black robes and gold jewelry.

Some families even hire professional mourners to cry at the funeral of their loved one because ""it serves as a reward to the person who has died,"" says Adwoa Yeboah Agyei, who owns The Funeral Shop and Services, a franchise with locations across Accra.

Ghanaian funerals are heavily symbolic and rituals involved include giving offerings to the spirits of the ancestors and loud traditional dancing and drumming to accompany the dead on their journey.

Anguished families

But a centuries-old tradition has come to a halt.

Since Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo suspended all public gatherings in mid-March in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, burials have been limited to no more than 25 people in the West African nation.

Obed Ampadu-Asiamah's 73-year-old father, Daniel, passed away soon after the announcement following complications from a stroke.

Obed has been scrambling to make painful phone calls send notices informing attendees he could only invite 25 family members and friends. They originally expected 2,000 people and an official funeral has been postponed to a later date.

""We had to cut all the in-laws and the grandchildren. None were able to attend,"" he told CNN, his voice shaking.

""We could only provide six slots for members on my father's side of the family and three for members of his church.""

The large funeral home they rented to hold the ceremony was moved into a small, private chapel within the same venue.

Face masks concealed the anguish on the faces of mourners dressed in red and black, as they stood several feet apart with heads bowed in remembrance of a highly respected man, who established churches in parts of West Africa.

Livestreaming burials

At Transitions, Ghana's largest private funeral home, a once heavy flow of ceremonies now trickles at a slow pace.

Genevieve Carnelius, the general manager, stated that finances and operations have been badly affected, but says her priority now is to work with clients like Obed to remotely reschedule their loved ones' funerals to uncertain future dates.

The home currently offers online live streaming from their chapel, where Ampadu-Asiamah's burial service took place, and where mourners across the globe can view the ceremonies of their loved ones.

Once a lucrative sector, businesses catering to funerals are reeling.

Maryam Abdullah is a fashion designer who sews traditional garments primarily for weddings and funerals.

In an empty shop once bustling with customers, she sighed as she explained how Covid-19 has affected her business.

""No one is coming. Even the people who have already brought cloths for me to sew have not returned to pick them up, said Maryam. She understands why, though. ""If this is what it takes to stop the spread of this coronavirus, I am okay.""

For now, she prefers her clients to stay at home because she feels more protected from contracting the virus herself, but it will only be a matter of time before funds run dry, she added.

A stray from traditional customs

Shaking hands with the family of the deceased is a deep-rooted tradition in many Ghanaian tribes that has taken place for hundreds of years and has become a mandatory part of ceremonies to show respect for the dead, says Queen Naa Tsotsoo Soyoo I, a Ghanaian Queen mother, who forms part of a powerful group of traditional women leaders.

She explained how significant the ban on mass funeral gatherings has affected the customs of such ceremonies.

""A significant part of funerals is bringing families together to embrace through handshakes, hugs and to mourn in close proximity of one another,"" said Queen Naa.

""The immediate implication of what is now taking place is that families will be unable to connect. This is something that has never happened in generations and it is definitely going to have a social impact.""

Coffin made and painted to resemble a mermaid for Ga tribal priestess of sea god carried by funeral guests.

Despite all the sudden changes to traditional practices at funerals, she acknowledged that certain inherent rites will never go away. For example, in Islam, the second largest religion practiced in Ghana, senior Muslim members of the community must recite Quranic verses over the deceased immediately after designated family members perform a ritual cleansing of the body.

The person must be buried within 24 hours of death.

""With all that is going on, the testament of a funeral will always be a view of how a person lived life and the core of every funeral is that the individual is sent off with respect and dignity,"" she added.

No one can predict how long the effects of Covid-19 will alter lives as we once knew it. But Queen Naa is certain of one thing thing. ""There will be many celebrations of life when this is all over.""",cnn,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/world/africa/ghana-burial-traditions-intl/index.htmlauthor

County now requires residents to wear face coverings. Here are the details,"Los Angeles County’s new requirement on wearing face coverings went into effect Wednesday night. Here’s a look at how that new law works, as well as similar orders around California.



How does L.A. County’s face-covering order work?

Customers of essential businesses are required to wear a face covering while inside.

Also, employers of essential businesses must give all employees whose duties require contact with other people a cloth face covering to wear while working with other people.



Do I have to wear it while in the backyard or walking alone outside?

The L.A. County order, effective for all 10 million people who live in Los Angeles County, does not require mask-wearing while in the backyard or while on a solitary run or walk.

Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said wearing face coverings protects other people from your germs in case you’re infected and don’t realize it.

She suggested wearing the face covering while you’re in places with other people, such as on a bus or a train while making an essential trip.

“If you’re all by yourself ... you can put it on if you want to, but you’re not required to,” Ferrer said.

People who live together also are not required to wear masks while on a walk or a jog, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said.

The cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments, issued similar orders to be consistent with L.A. County’s order. A similar order for the city of Los Angeles, with a population of 4 million people, went into effect Friday.

Have some cities issued even stronger face-covering rules?

Beverly Hills and Glendale require face coverings whenever people leave home, including for walks through the neighborhood.

Under the order, drivers traveling alone or with members of their households do not need to wear face coverings unless they lower their vehicle’s windows for any reason, including to interact with first responders, food service workers or others who are not members of their household.

What about other counties in Southern California?

San Diego County requires employees who may have contact with the public to wear a cloth face covering, such as in grocery stores, pharmacies, convenience stores, gas stations and banks, as well as on public transit and for childcare providers while serving food.

Orange County is strongly encouraging residents to wear face coverings when leaving home, as well as employees at essential businesses while working. The city of Costa Mesa, however, is generally making face coverings mandatory when residents or visitors are outside their home or personal vehicle while performing or accessing an essential service.

Riverside County requires everyone to wear a face covering when leaving home.

San Bernardino County requires everyone to wear a face covering when outside the home for essential activities.

Ventura County is urging residents to wear a face covering if they will be around others.

What about the San Francisco Bay Area?

A number of San Francisco Bay Area counties, including San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo and Marin, are requiring face coverings for people when they are outside their homes to access essential businesses such as grocery stores or pharmacies, while seeking healthcare services and while waiting for and riding public transit. Masks aren’t required for children 12 or younger. They also aren’t required while at home, in cars alone or with members of the same household or while walking, hiking, cycling or running outdoors, although people are asked to have one readily accessible.

Sonoma County is requiring people to wear face coverings before entering any indoor facility outside their home, such as grocery stores, dry cleaners, offices and post offices; in any enclosed open space, like construction sites; in taxis, ride-hail vehicles and buses; and in outdoor areas when people are unable to keep six feet away from others at all times, such as farmers markets, gas stations and drive-thrus.

Santa Clara County is urging people to wear face masks in public.

What do state and federal authorities say?

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings such as grocery stores and pharmacies, where it can be hard to keep six feet away from other people.

The California Department of Public Health says wearing face coverings may reduce asymptomatic transmission of the virus and reinforce physical distancing.

“There is limited evidence to suggest that use of cloth face coverings by the public during a pandemic could help reduce disease transmission,” the agency said. “Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs or sneezes, including someone who has COVID-19 but feels well.

“Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing and washing hands and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these primary interventions,” the agency said.

What kinds of face coverings are acceptable?

Bandannas, fabric masks and neck gaiters are permitted. Officials are urging residents to reserve medical-grade masks and N95 respirators for medical professionals and first responders.

High temperatures have rolled through the Southwest unusually early this year, scorching Phoenix and Las Vegas and sending droves of quarantine-weary Southern Californians to the beaches.

Even before the outbreak, the hottest parts of the country were struggling to protect their residents from summer weather that, fueled by global warming, has become increasingly dangerous. Now the COVID-19 epidemic has presented them with an added crisis — the possibility of millions of people self-isolating in homes and apartments they can’t keep cool.

This is an especially worrying possibility for the elderly and people in poor neighborhoods, where residents are more likely to live in older, less energy-efficient homes and less likely to have air conditioners.

Advertisement

According to a 2019 study by USC scientists, about a third of households in Greater Los Angeles, and roughly half in neighborhoods near the coast, don’t have air conditioning.

Those who do have air conditioning but are living paycheck to paycheck may be reluctant to use it consistently to avoid high electricity bills.

Rupa Basu, chief of the air and climate epidemiological section for the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, said the virus’ effect could be amplified, in part, because it is killing people at higher rates who are already the most susceptible to extreme heat. For older people and Americans with chronic medical conditions, “it’s like getting hit twice,” she said.

In essence, the people who need to stay home the most are in the greatest danger of dying there during a heat wave.

“The messaging here is really tricky,” said Eric Klinenberg, a professor of sociology at New York University and the author of “Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.” Health officials need to be honest about the dangers of the virus and who is most at risk, he said. But it’s also important for older people and those in poor health to know they shouldn’t sit at home alone all day.

“We have millions of people who are aging alone who feel like they need to stay indoors,” he said. “And social isolation combined with extreme heat is a proven killer.”

Many Americans have been stuck at home, venturing out only to buy groceries or go for a walk, and those efforts at self-quarantining have been vital to slowing the spread of the virus in hot spots such as New York City and New Orleans. Yet that progress has not been uniform. Although some states are beginning to lift restrictions, urged on by President Trump, outbreaks continue to emerge in prisons, meatpacking plants and formerly untouched towns and counties in rural parts of the South and Midwest.

The administration has cautioned that without a cure or vaccine, some form of social distancing will probably remain in place throughout the summer.

With that in mind, cities have closed senior centers, libraries, public pools and gyms — places of refuge on blisteringly hot days — that could also become places of contagion during an epidemic. In California, state and local authorities have clashed over whether to close beaches.

Middle-class Americans can still retreat into their air-conditioned homes and cars, but for low-income residents and seniors on tight budgets, staying home during the summer could be dangerous.

Recent research by USC environmental engineering professor George Ban-Weiss and his team suggests that communities most vulnerable to extreme heat have some of the the lowest rates of air conditioning and the highest rates of poverty. In Compton, Inglewood and Lynwood, only about 40% of households have air conditioning.

Advertisement

None of the 6,500 units owned and managed by the city of Los Angeles’ Housing Authority come with air conditioning, not even in the San Fernando Valley, where summer temperatures can be especially punishing.

Eric Brown, a spokesman for the authority, known as HACLA, said that most of the city’s public housing was built in the 1930s and ‘40s, before air conditioning was considered essential. Residents are allowed to install their own window units if they get the agency’s permission, he said, which it has always given.

The situation is only marginally better in public housing managed by the county, where about half the units — including all of those occupied by elderly residents — have air conditioning.

In Arizona, where air conditioning can be a matter of life and death, public health officials and heat researchers are concerned about the state’s homeless population and people living in mobile homes built decades ago, before modern building codes.

Advertisement

Notoriously difficult and expensive to cool, mobile homes can easily surpass 90 degrees indoors during the summer. Their residents, who tend to be older, are already overrepresented among indoor heat-related deaths.

David Hondula, a climatologist who studies the impact of heat on health at Arizona State University, said that another factor researchers are paying attention to is substance abuse.

People who struggle with sobriety are at greater risk of dying from exposure to extreme heat, he said. A world upended by the coronavirus — in which 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment, anxiety is the norm, and addiction support groups including Alcoholics Anonymous have had to switch to online meetings — could make more people susceptible.

“The stress and worry of coronavirus could lead to increased use of those substances which impair one’s ability to cope with the heat,” Hondula said.

The combination of the virus and the approaching summer season is forcing health officials and emergency managers to rethink long-established protocols for responding to extreme heat. For the last month, public officials across Arizona have joined a weekly hourlong conference call to discuss strategies for providing shelter and distributing water without inadvertently spreading the coronavirus among the people they’re trying to serve.

When the first heat wave of the year arrived in the Southwest last week, enveloping the region in record heat for April, officials in Arizona and Nevada scrambled to open cooling centers for people who don’t have air conditioning at home.

In Maricopa County, Ariz., which spent five days under an excessive heat warning, the coronavirus complicated efforts. Many of the public buildings that would normally be converted into shelters had been closed down, their staff self-isolating at home, limiting the number of cooling centers that could be opened to the public and placing more of the burden on charitable organizations and religious groups.

Brande Mead, human services director for the Maricopa Assn. of Governments, a Phoenix-based regional planning group, said that donations of bottled water were also down.

Advertisement

“Water and other supplies can be hard to obtain right now,” Mead said. “In many of the grocery stores, the water aisle is empty.”

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called on cities and states operating cooling centers to maintain at least six feet between people and to screen visitors, including conducting temperature checks, before they enter. “If possible,” the agency’s guidelines state, “provide alternative cooling sites for those showing symptoms of COVID-19.”

The agency also said that states should consider expanding programs that help people pay their utility bills, such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, as a way to lower the number of people using cooling centers.

In the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, about half the states issued orders barring utilities from turning off customers’ power, heat or water if they had overdue bills. In other states, customers are dependent on the generosity of their utilities companies, many of which voluntarily agreed to suspend disconnections.

Advertisement

But whether those suspensions will last through the summer is unclear. And there is considerable disagreement among social service providers and public officials about whether such steps actually benefit customers who’ve fallen behind on their payments.

In 2019, following news that an Arizona woman had died after her power was shut off for non-payment, the Arizona Corporation Commission — which oversees public utilities — placed a moratorium on summertime power disconnections. When the suspension ended in mid-October, some customers were left with staggeringly high electric bills.

It’s too early to say whether the suspension saved lives. Official heat-related death statistics for 2019 have not been released yet, but Hondula said the preliminary data show there was not a dramatic reduction. In Maricopa County, 196 peopled are thought to have died from heat exposure last summer, up from 182 the year before.

Is it a turning point?,"California recorded its first week-over-week decline in reported coronavirus deaths, a promising if preliminary sign of progress as Gov. Gavin Newsom prepared to reopen some businesses this week.

Two weeks ago, California reported its highest one-week death toll — 542 fatalities among people infected with the coronavirus between April 20 and April 26. Last week, the weekly death toll fell for the first time, dropping nearly 9% to 495 fatalities for the seven-day period that ended Sunday, according to a Times data analysis.

While it was an improvement, last week’s toll was still the third highest over the course of the pandemic.

Even hard-hit parts of the state saw some relief. Los Angeles County, home to 55% of California’s COVID-19 deaths despite having only one-quarter of the state’s population, saw its reported weekly death toll flatten for the first time: 315 deaths each week for the last two weeks.

The San Francisco Bay Area reported 49 deaths last week, a decrease from the 61 fatalities reported the previous week; San Diego County reported 28 deaths last week, a drop from the 40 reported the previous week. The San Joaquin Valley reported 22 deaths last week, a decline from the 25 reported the previous week, and the Sacramento area reported four deaths last week, down from 12 the previous week. The Central Coast reported three deaths last week, the same as the previous week.

Nationally, nearly 13,000 deaths were reported last week, compared with nearly 14,000 the previous week.

But California still has not seen the sustained 14-day decline in coronavirus cases the White House has suggested as a key criteria before easing stay-at-home orders. The state reported its highest weekly coronavirus case total during April 20-26, with 12,122 cases. Last week, 9,967 cases were reported, an 18% decline, but last week’s case count was still the second-highest weekly total reported during the pandemic.

Statewide, the number of hospitalizations remains steady and flat, with perhaps some initial signs of decreasing, the state health officer, Dr. Sonia Angell, said Monday. The statewide average daily number of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 was 4,822 last week, down nearly 2% from 4,905 the previous week.

Hospitalizations have been flat in the five Southern California counties closest to Los Angeles, as well as the San Joaquin Valley and San Diego County. But hospitalizations are noticeably trending downward in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Sacramento region, the Central Coast and the Shasta Cascade region, made up of the eight counties in northeastern California.

California, which has recorded more than 2,200 fatalities, has seen far fewer deaths compared to hot spots such as New York and New Jersey, which have respectively logged deaths of more than 24,000 and more than 7,000. Experts credit early social distancing rules for part of that trend. Newsom announced Monday that some retail stores across the state can reopen for curbside pickup as early as Friday.

The new changes are part of a four-stage plan the governor laid out last week to gradually transition back to normal in a state of nearly 40 million people whose lives have been upended by the COVID-19 health crisis.

But Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that different cities will need to take different steps to emerge from the pandemic-induced shutdown and that city and county officials are still trying to determine the safest course.

Only time will tell whether the weekly drop is a momentary blip or marks the beginning of a sustained decline in cases. Experts have warned about a rise in cases and deaths as governments ease stay-at-home orders, and there continues to be worry about a second wave of deadly cases later in the year.

And COVID-19 continues to be a severe threat, having become the leading cause of death in L.A. County, surpassing the previous top killer, coronary heart disease.

“Ninety-five percent of us have still not been infected. And until there’s a vaccine, most residents in L.A. County can be infected at any time over the months to come,” Los Angeles County’s director of public health, Barbara Ferrer, said last week. “Without taking extraordinary measures to reduce our exposures to people who are infected, and to keep our distance as much as possible, we could easily see a big spike in new cases.”

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that it’s hard to predict whether the pandemic will become increasingly quiet after June, or if large outbreaks could occur as states ease stay-at-home orders. Currently, the national death toll is more than 68,000, according to Johns Hopkins University, having killed more Americans than the Vietnam War.

“When you look out to the end of June, it’s probably the case that we’re going to get above 100,000 deaths nationally,” Gottlieb said on the CBS program. “But what happens when we come back in the fall and schools are back in session? ... Then you can see this slow simmer explode into a new epidemic or large outbreaks. That’s the concern, that if we don’t snuff this out more, and you have this slow burn of infection, it can ignite at any time.”

Here are charts showing coronavirus-related deaths, hospitalizations and cases by region — Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, the San Joaquin Valley, San Diego County, the Sacramento area, the Central Coast and the Shasta Cascade region.

Gavin Newsom', 'California Politics In Sacramento For The Los Angeles Times.']",2020-05-05,Newsom calls reopening Yuba and Sutter counties a ‘big mistake’ amid coronavirus crisis,"Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday criticized two rural Northern California counties that are allowing businesses and restaurants to reopen, saying their decision to defy his statewide stay-at-home order has put their communities at increased risk for a new coronavirus outbreak.

Sutter and Yuba counties, both north of Sacramento, allowed businesses to reopen on Monday after a similar decision was made in Modoc County in California’s northeastern corner. Officials in the three counties argued that they were less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than hot spots such as Los Angeles and the Bay Area and said the shutdown was hurting their local economies.

“They’re making a big mistake. They’re putting their public at risk. They’re putting our progress at risk,” Newsom said during a COVID-19 briefing in Sacramento on Tuesday. “These are real exceptions. The overwhelming majority of Californians are playing by the rules doing the right thing.”

But Newsom did not say if the state would take any action to enforce the stay-at-home order and other statewide restrictions in those counties.

Instead, the Democratic governor encouraged officials there to abide by his more measured plan for reopening, which was announced Monday and will allow some retail stores across the state to reopen as early as Friday if certain safeguards are put in place.

Under the new statewide COVID-19 guidelines, the governor said bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, sporting goods retailers and others can reopen for pickup, and manufacturing and logistics can resume in the retail supply chain. Newsom said more detailed guidelines on the businesses that can resume limited operations would be released later this week.

Shopping malls, gyms, bars, barbershops, salons and similar establishments must remain closed under Newsom’s order, and in-restaurant dining remains prohibited.

Newsom said some of the restrictions would be eased if county health officials, in concurrence with their county board of supervisors, can verify that they have adequate healthcare facilities and personal protective equipment to care for COVID-19 patients, and the capability to test, isolate and track those who have the virus. Newsom said that if a county has a low number of COVID-19 cases, that will be considered when the state issues variances.

In spite of those requirements, however, Dr. Ngoc-Phuong Luu, health officer for Yuba and Sutter counties, issued new orders on Friday that allow restaurants, retailers, shopping malls, gyms, fitness studios, salons, spas and tattoo parlors to operate.

“They put those businesses at risk, not only the health of their communities at risk. I would encourage them just to do the right thing and know that we are committed to working with them as we have been,” Newsom said. “We have a process and protocol to do that. And so we believe in ready-aim-fire — not, ready-fire-aim”

The governor’s comments came during a visit Tuesday to Display California, a small business in Sacramento, to highlight his plan to ease restrictions.

Newsom also faced defiance in Southern California after he ordered the closure of all Orange County beaches last week. The governor took that action after thousands of beachgoers flocked to the the coast during the recent heatwave, ignoring Newsom’s pleas to stay at home and maintain a safe distance from others.

On Tuesday, the state announced that three Orange County beach cities — Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and Dana Point — will be permitted to reopen their stretches of coastline this week with certain limitations, including taking steps to avoid overcrowding and allow safe physical distancing.

The move came a day after similar plans for Laguna Beach and San Clemente were approved by the state, and several days after the Huntington Beach City Council voted to take legal action to block Newsom’s beach closure.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/newsom-reopening-of-yuba-and-sutter-counties-coronavirus

Gavin Newsom ordered the closure of all Orange County beaches to stem the spread of the coronavirus, state officials have announced that three beach cities will be permitted to reopen their stretches of coastline this week with certain limitations.

Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Seal Beach submitted plans to Sacramento that would allow the public to immediately access the coastline for active recreation only. The plans, approved Tuesday, include a range of measures to avoid overcrowding and allow safe physical distancing, according to the California Natural Resources Agency.

Under Huntington Beach’s plan, people are now permitted to use the beach from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. with the stipulation that they remain active. Sunbathing is not allowed. Parking meters along Pacific Coast Highway and the beach’s bike path are available for use, but the pier and the city’s beach parking lot will remain closed.

“We’re delighted to be reopening our beaches for active recreation, which will allow our community to once again enjoy the recreational and mental health benefits from spending time in the Pacific Ocean,” Mayor Lyn Semeta said in a prepared statement. “The new active recreation rules that we’re instituting will allow for continued beach access in a manner that emphasizes the need to practice safe social distancing.”

Seal Beach’s coastline will be open — beginning Monday — for limited hours Monday through Thursday with the requirement that visitors remain active while on the sand.

Officials in Dana Point said their beaches will also only be open to walking, running and recreational uses like swimming and surfing. No gatherings will be permitted, but the public can still access the city’s tide pools.

Dana Point City Manager Mike Killebrew said in a statement that he hopes “everyone understands how important it is that we all follow new guidelines that will promote socially responsible recreation and enjoyment by the public.”

“We know how important our beaches are to the residents of Dana Point. And we know how much residents value, especially now, access to our beautiful coastline,” he said.

State-operated beaches within the Huntington Beach and Dana Point city limits also reopened with the same active-recreation protocols, city officials said.

The move came a day after similar plans for Laguna Beach and San Clemente were approved by the state.

The only coastal city that has not yet gained approval from the state to reopen is Newport Beach. The city, just a few miles south of Huntington Beach, also submitted a plan to Sacramento on Saturday to safely reopen their coastline, said city spokesman John Pope.

“We have been closely coordinating with Huntington Beach about strategies to enhance the management of our beaches,” Pope said. “Despite repeated attempts by city staff to connect with state officials, we have not yet received any information on an approval or modifications, or when a decision might be made.”

Newsom last week ordered a “hard close” of all Orange County beaches. The order came after an April heat wave sent thousands to the sand in some beach communities. Newsom called the images circulating of people congregating on Orange County’s shores “disturbing.”

The closure prompted a legal showdown between cities and the state, as well as outrage from the public . Some argued that the governor was targeting Orange County based on photographs that did not show the full scope of what was happening on the beaches.

Newsom on Tuesday praised local leaders in Orange County beach cities for working with his administration to reach an agreement. Just days ago, city leaders in Huntington Beach and Dana Point voted to take legal action against the governor.

Huntington Beach City Atty. Michael Gates said the city is continuing to move forward with its request for an injunction against the governor’s order despite the beaches being allowed to reopen.

Newsom said his administration has been negotiating with the beach cities since the weekend and said he hoped to make a future announcement about beach access in Orange County soon.

“It’s a spirit of collaboration and cooperation that is necessary as we move forward,” Newsom said during his daily COVID-19 briefing in Sacramento.

On Tuesday, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted to submit a plan to the state that would allow county-operated beaches to reopen for active recreation.

Supervisor Lisa Bartlett, who proposed the item, said it would help put county beaches in line with what was happening in nearby cities and allow people to get out and recreate along the coast.

“We want people to walk and jog and run and enjoy water sports but to keep moving,” she said, “and the state is fully behind that.”

Supervisor Don Wagner opposed the motion, along with Supervisor Michelle Steel, saying any restrictions on beach activity were arbitrary and that it was appalling that the county would bow to rules the governor put in place without input from local officials.

“This is exactly what we shouldn’t be doing as a government,” Wagner said.

Gavin Newsom announcing that some stores could open by the end of the week, Southern California communities are considering what to do next as coronavirus cases continue to increase.

Los Angeles County officials confirmed 58 more COVID-19 deaths Tuesday, bringing the total number of coronavirus-related fatalities in the county to 1,313. Of those who have died, 647 were living in institutional settings — the majority of which were nursing facilities.

Officials reported an additional 1,638 cases — a high number that is largely due to a backlog in data reporting. So far, there have been 27,815 confirmed coronavirus infections in the county.

As communities continue to report more cases and deaths linked to the virus throughout the state, which has seen more than 56,000 confirmed infections and nearly 3,000 related deaths, Newsom announced Monday that some retail stores across the state could reopen with modifications as early as Friday. The news came amid growing pressure to ease the stay-at-home order that has cratered the California economy .

Advertisement

On Tuesday, Newsom said social-distancing practices would remain in place as more people would be put at risk when restrictions were lifted.

“We have to maintain the core construct of our stay-at-home orders,” he said at a news conference.

The economy will start to reopen, but that doesn’t mean people can “go back to normal,” Newsom said. Since COVID-19 is still present, the reopening relies on Californians remaining cautious and following safety protocols.

The virus has affected some parts of California more than others, and some cities’ officials have struggled with when, how — and whether — to begin reopening. Ventura County, for example, has been less affected than has neighboring Los Angeles County, the most populous in the state with 10 million people. L.A. County continues to be a hotbed of the crisis.

Here is a rundown of where Southern California stands right now:

Los Angeles County

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that different cities would need to take different steps to emerge from the pandemic -induced shutdown and that city and county officials were still trying to determine the safest course.

“Our timing on opening may vary from other parts of the state,” he said. “I will reopen our city with careful consideration, guided by public health professionals.”

Advertisement

Garcetti said he did not expect city businesses to be able to offer curbside delivery on Friday in step with Newsom’s outline. L.A.'s Safer at Home order is in effect until May 15 and Garcetti said that he hoped steps restricting commerce could begin to be rolled back by then.

On Tuesday, Garcetti said he supports working in the next few days and weeks on the reopening of “low-risk spaces,” such as trails.

He also announced a new initiative, L.A. Represents, to provide free legal services to residents facing hardships, such as debt and bankruptcy, caused by COVID-19. Volunteer attorneys would represent vulnerable renters and survivors of domestic violence, he said.

“People are finding themselves in some of the most pressing and painful moments of their lives,” Garcetti said. “These are complex situations, and we don’t always all understand the law.”

Advertisement

He said the initiative would also include a support system for small businesses to get back on their feet by helping them renegotiate leases or apply for government loans.

“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy,” he said. “They too often lack effective representation.”

Garcetti also said he is permitting flower wholesalers to open to gear up for Mother’s Day, which he described as one of the industry’s biggest days of the year.

Los Angeles County Public Health director Barbara Ferrer said Monday that officials would be publicly sharing recovery plans this week, noting that “wherever it’s possible to safely reopen, we’ll be doing so as quickly as possible.”

Advertisement

She noted that although social distancing practices had helped slow the spread of COVID-19, the virus remains easily transmissible.

“The virus has not changed,” she said. “More people die in L.A. County every day from COVID-19 than any other disease.”

On Tuesday, she reiterated that fact, adding that as the county plans its first stages of reopening, it must ensure that a spike in cases does not take place.

“We want to make sure we don’t see an increase in our death rate as we are reopening,” she said.

Ferrer previously said the total number of deaths linked to the coronavirus was greater than those who died from influenza over the last eight-month flu season.

Of the 1,201 individuals who have died of COVID-19 where race and ethnicity have been identified, 38% of individuals were Latino, 28% were white, 19% were Asian, 12% were African American, 1% were Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and 1% identified as another race.

Ferrer said African Americans and those who were identified as Native Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander were dying at a much higher rate than all others in L.A. County.

Roughly 93% of all individuals who have died from the virus had underlying health conditions, including lung issues, asthma, heart conditions, immuno-compromised illnesses, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease and liver disease. Ferrer stressed that any individuals with HIV also should take steps to protect themselves.

San Diego County

San Diego city and county leaders unveiled proposed regulations that businesses would have to meet before reopening their doors, as well as a plan to help meet those regulations. The county of roughly 3.4 million has reported more than 4,000 infections and at least 144 deaths linked to the virus.

Although a list detailing which businesses will be allowed to reopen is not yet available, city and county leaders have said there are steps all businesses should be taking as they move toward reopening.

“We can’t do anything about the stay-at-home order — that is clearly up to the governor,” county Supervisor Greg Cox said. “But what we can do is help make it easier for businesses to reopen safely and smartly and smoothly as soon as possible if they have these [guidelines] to work from.”

Advertisement

At Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting, Cox and fellow Supervisor Nathan Fletcher will propose the Reopen San Diego Business Safety Framework , which will require all businesses to develop a Safe Reopening Plan before welcoming customers again.

Such reopening plans are intended to ensure employee and customer safety by increasing sanitation, enforcing physical distancing and encouraging communication with county officials.

A plan unveiled Monday is designed to help businesses meet those county regulations. That plan was developed by the Responsible COVID-19 Economic Reopening Advisory Group and can be used by restaurants, hair and nail salons, and other businesses as they plan to reopen.

“San Diego is ready to recover, and is preparing for a reopening that’s safe, strategic and specific to our diverse industries,” San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said. “These guidelines will help get the economy back on its feet and get San Diegans back to work when state and regional orders are lifted.”

The advisory group’s plan includes five focus areas:

Employee health: Procure and provide personal protective equipment for employees, and commit to voluntary compliance with public health officials on contact tracing and testing.

Safe work site entry: Establish controlled entrance and exit practices to avoid queuing issues and work with the Public Health Department to create processes for checking employees’ symptoms.

Workplace distancing and conditions: Evaluate occupancy and capacity to ensure proper physical distancing and keep shifts consistent with the same employees in each rotation or shift.

Employee training and compliance: Ensure signage on safety requirements, such as hand-washing, physical distancing and reporting procedures for employees who become ill.

Enhanced cleaning and sanitation: Develop a sanitation plan that includes frequent cleaning of restrooms, workstations and public spaces.

The economic advisory group also plans to provide enhanced guidance specific to industries such as restaurants, spas and construction. Those plans are still in development.

Riverside County

The Riverside County Board of Supervisors is also considering ending local public health orders amid a growing push to begin reopening. The county of roughly 2.5 million has reported more than 4,300 infections — the second highest in the state — and 181 deaths linked to the virus.

Supervisors Karen Spiegel and V. Manuel Perez proposed the changes, which include rescinding school closures, ending limitations on short-term lodging, removing restrictions on golf course use and eliminating the requirements to wear face coverings and engaging in social distancing.

The Riverside City Council on Monday urged the county to hold off on the plan.

“We know that the coronavirus is still out there and that we need to continue to be vigilant,” said City Councilman Andy Melendrez, according to the Riverside Press-Enterprise.

Last week, the county’s public health officer, Dr. Cameron Kaiser, lifted a few restrictions, including reopening some parks, trails and recreation areas, such as golf courses and tennis courts. However, Kaiser also extended a county health order requiring residents to wear face coverings and practice social distancing through June 19.

Individual counties have the authority to impose health orders that best suit their region, as long as they are not more lax than Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order. Riverside County had previously implemented some of the strictest public health orders in California.

“I want to thank our residents and our county team, whose actions to this unprecedented pandemic have helped us get to this point,” Perez said in a written statement. “Now, we must continue to prepare for our economic recovery and get people back to work.”

Orange County

Orange County officials continue to express concern over Newsom’s decision to close beaches to slow the spread of coronavirus, even as the county continues to report new cases and deaths.

The county of roughly 3.2 million has confirmed nearly 90 infections and 57 deaths, including five reported Monday.

After Huntington Beach and Dana Point filed a lawsuit against the decision, and Newport Beach agreed to file a court brief in support of the endeavor, state officials announced Tuesday that the beach cities would be permitted to reopen their stretches of coastline this week with certain limitations.

The announcement came one day after officials said Laguna Beach and San Clemente would be allowed to open their shores this week, with similar limitations in place.

Both cities previously submitted plans to the state that would allow active recreation along their coastlines while maintaining measures to avoid overcrowding and allow for appropriate physical distancing.

“We appreciate the governor’s willingness to work with us to provide a responsible, gradual approach to reopening all beaches in Laguna Beach for active recreation,” Mayor Bob Whalen said in a statement Monday. “This will allow people the opportunity to walk, jog, swim and surf and get some fresh air and exercise on a limited basis, but not congregate or gather in large groups.”

Wagner, however, characterized the idea of an active plan as “half-steps that satisfy, I guess, the governor’s need to feel like he’s won something.”

“The science is entirely in favor of the position the county took before the governor’s ill-advised order,” he said.

Orange County Executive Officer Frank Kim said Monday that the decision of whether the county itself should submit such a plan rested with the Board of Supervisors, which is expected to discuss the matter Tuesday.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/california-communities-debate-how-quickly-to-lift-stay-at-home-rules-reopen-economy

The whistleblower complaint by Rick Bright, who was abruptly reassigned from his post overseeing drug and vaccine development at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, also says administration officials pressured him to back widespread use of anti-malaria drugs touted by President Trump as a treatment for the virus, even after Bright warned about possible health dangers.

The allegations shed new light on the Trump administration’s disorganized and tardy response to the public health crisis, which has claimed more than 70,000 lives in the U.S. despite assurances by Trump and other senior officials earlier this year that the virus represented little threat to Americans.

Bright, who has a PhD in immunology, was involved in multiple meetings and discussions with senior White House and health officials in the first months of 2020, giving him a front-row seat to the administration response, including Trump’s promotion of the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.

“I was pressured to let politics and cronyism drive decisions over the recommendations of the best scientists we have,” Bright said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. “Their eagerness to push blindly forward without scientific data to put this drug into the hands of Americans was alarming to me.”

Bright was abruptly removed in April as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a research agency within the Health and Human Services Department that, among other duties, was overseeing research on coronavirus vaccines.

He contends that his reassignment to a lesser job at the National Institutes of Health was in retaliation for his repeated clashes with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Robert Kadlec, an Azar deputy with responsibility for overseeing public health preparedness. Kadlec, the assistant secretary for planning and readiness, oversaw Bright’s office.

Bright’s ouster was “retaliation, plain and simple,” said Debra S. Katz, one of his lawyers. “They sidelined him and excluded him and ignored his very detailed advice.”

His claims are detailed in a complaint seeking reinstatement to his post that was filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which oversees the protection of whistleblowers.

“HHS political leadership leveled baseless criticisms against [Bright] for his proactive efforts to invest early in vaccine development as well as in critical supplies such as masks, respirators, and swabs, which were in short supply and would be necessary to combat COVID-19,” the complaint says.

In response to questions, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley did not directly address Bright’s allegations, saying in a statement Tuesday: “Dr. Bright was transferred to NIH to work on diagnostics testing — critical to combatting COVID-19 — where he has been entrusted to spend upwards of $1 billion to advance that effort. We are deeply disappointed that he has not shown up to work on behalf of the American people and lead on this critical endeavor.”

In addition to their sharp disagreements over coronavirus, Bright alleges in the complaint that he opposed moves by Kadlec to award contracts worth tens of millions of dollars to several small pharmaceutical companies represented by a friend of Kadlec’s who was working as industry consultant.

In November, he opposed a $100-million proposal to fund an Ebola treatment developed “by a longtime friend of Dr. Kadlec” at Emory University in Atlanta and marketed by a small Miami-based firm called Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, according to the complaint. Last month, the consortium again sought Health and Human Services funding, claiming the drug showed promise against coronavirus, even though no human trials had been conducted, the complaint says.

Ridgeback and Emory did not return calls seeking comment.

The 89-page complaint documents repeated efforts by Bright in the first weeks of 2020 to urge Azar, Kadlec and other administration officials to quickly mobilize to secure masks and other protective equipment for the U.S. medical system to prepare for an outbreak of the virus here.

Widespread shortages of protective equipment for medical workers and testing supplies have persisted throughout the coronavirus outbreak, hampering the U.S. medical response and complicating current efforts to end stay-at-home orders across the country.

As early as Jan. 18, just days after coronavirus cases began to be recorded outside China, Bright pushed Kadlec to begin convening special disaster-planning meetings to coordinate a response across the federal government, according to the complaint.

Kadlec wrote back in an email cited in the complaint that he was “not sure if that is a time sensitive urgency.”

When Bright relayed warnings from mask manufacturers that they were having trouble getting through to U.S. government officials about the need to make production plans, he was similarly rebuffed, he said.

Even as senior health officials finally began to acknowledge the supply issues, Kadlec and others assured the White House in a Feb. 14 briefing that there were no immediate supply-chain issues, Bright’s complaint alleges.

Bright also notes that his skepticism about the anti-malaria drugs touted by Trump antagonized senior administration officials.

“In an apparent effort to score a short-term political victory for the Administration during the escalating health crisis,” Kadlec’s office “pressured BARDA to promote the malaria drug chloroquine,” the complaint says.

Bright said he was ordered on March 23 by Health and Human Services general counsel Bob Charrow, in a directive from the White House, “to drop everything and make the chloroquine donated by Bayer widely available to the American public.”

Bayer had donated chloroquine to the government for for use in treating coronavirus. The company got the drug from factories in India and Pakistan, and it was brought into the U.S. without inspection by the Food and Drug Administration, which concerned Bright, the complaint says.

On March 29, at Bright’s urging, the FDA issued an authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, limiting its use by licensed healthcare providers to treat certain patients who could not otherwise participate in a randomized, controlled trial.

After Trump again touted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 during a White House news conference on April 4, Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir instructed Kadlec and other federal officials to mobilize the nation’s supply chain to “flood NY and NJ with treatment courses [of hydroxychloroquine],” according to an email included in the complaint.

“Bright felt powerless to protect the public from this potentially toxic chemical that HHS, at President Trump’s insistence, was touting as a safe treatment,” the complaint notes.

"['Ralph Vartabedian', 'A Former National Correspondent At The Los Angeles Times', 'Joined The Newspaper In']",2020-05-05,Scientists say a now-dominant strain of the coronavirus appears to be more contagious than original,"Scientists have identified a new strain of the coronavirus that has become dominant worldwide and appears to be more contagious than the versions that spread in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new study led by scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The new strain appeared in February in Europe, migrated quickly to the East Coast of the United States and has been the dominant strain across the world since mid-March, the scientists wrote.

In addition to spreading faster, it may make people vulnerable to a second infection after a first bout with the disease, the report warned.

The 33-page report was posted Thursday on BioRxiv, a website that researchers use to share their work before it is peer reviewed, an effort to speed up collaborations with scientists working on COVID-19 vaccines or treatments. That research has been largely based on the genetic sequence of earlier strains and might not be effective against the new one.

The mutation identified in the new report affects the now infamous spikes on the exterior of the coronavirus, which allow it to enter human respiratory cells. The report’s authors said they felt an “urgent need for an early warning” so that vaccines and drugs under development around the world will be effective against the mutated strain.

Wherever the new strain appeared, it quickly infected far more people than the earlier strains that came out of Wuhan, China, and within weeks it was the only strain that was prevalent in some nations, according to the report. The new strain’s dominance over its predecessors demonstrates that it is more infectious, according to the report, though exactly why is not yet known.

The coronavirus, known to scientists as SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 3.5 million people around the world and caused more than 250,000 COVID-19 deaths since its discovery late last year.

The report was based on a computational analysis of more than 6,000 coronavirus sequences from around the world, collected by the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data, a public-private organization in Germany. Time and again, the analysis found the new version was transitioning to become dominant.

The Los Alamos team, assisted by scientists at Duke University and the University of Sheffield in England, identified 14 mutations. Those mutations occurred among the nearly 30,000 base pairs of RNA that other scientists say make up the coronavirus’s genome. The report authors focused on a mutation called D614G, which is responsible for the change in the virus’ spikes.

“The story is worrying, as we see a mutated form of the virus very rapidly emerging, and over the month of March becoming the dominant pandemic form,” study leader Bette Korber, a computational biologist at Los Alamos, wrote on her Facebook page. “When viruses with this mutation enter a population, they rapidly begin to take over the local epidemic, thus they are more transmissible.”

While the Los Alamos report is highly technical and dispassionate, Korber expressed some deep personal feelings about the implications of the finding in her Facebook post.

“This is hard news,” wrote Korber, “but please don’t only be disheartened by it. Our team at LANL was able to document this mutation and its impact on transmission only because of a massive global effort of clinical people and experimental groups, who make new sequences of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) in their local communities available as quickly as they possibly can.”

Korber, a graduate of Cal State Long Beach who went on to earn a PhD in chemistry at Caltech, joined the lab in 1990 and focused much of her work on an HIV vaccine. In 2004, she won the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the U.S. Department of Energy’s highest recognition for scientific achievement. She contributed a portion of the financial prize to help establish an orphanage for young AIDS victims in South Africa.

The report contains regional breakdowns of when the new strain of virus first emerged and how long it took to become dominant.

Italy was one of the first countries to see the new virus in the last week of February, almost at the same time that the original strain appeared. Washington was among the first states to get hit with the original strain in late February, but by March 15 the mutated strain dominated. New York was hit by the original virus around March 15, but within days the mutant strain took over. The team did not report results for California.

Scientists at major organizations working on a vaccine or drugs have told The Times that they are pinning their hopes on initial evidence that the virus is stable and not likely to mutate the way influenza virus does, requiring a new vaccine every year. The Los Alamos report could upend that assumption.

If the pandemic fails to wane seasonally as the weather warms, the study warns, the virus could undergo further mutations even as research organizations prepare the first medical treatments and vaccines. Without getting on top of the risk now, the effectiveness of vaccines could be limited. Some of the compounds in development are supposed to latch onto the spike or interrupt its action. If they were designed based on the original version of the spike, they might not be effective against the new coronavirus strain, the study’s authors warned.

“We cannot afford to be blindsided as we move vaccines and antibodies into clinical testing,” Korber wrote on Facebook. “Please be encouraged by knowing the global scientific community is on this, and we are cooperating with each other in ways I have never seen … in my 30 years as a scientist.”

David Montefiori, a Duke University scientist who worked on the report said it is the first to document a mutation in the coronavirus that appears to make it more infectious.

Although the researchers don’t yet know the details about how the mutated spike behaves inside the body, it’s clearly doing something that gives it an evolutionary advantage over its predecessor and is fueling its rapid spread. One scientist called it a “classic case of Darwinian evolution.”

“D614G is increasing in frequency at an alarming rate, indicating a fitness advantage relative to the original Wuhan strain that enables more rapid spread,” the study said.

Still unknown is whether this mutant virus could account for regional variations in how hard COVID-19 is hitting different parts of the world.

In the United States, doctors had begun to independently question whether new strains of the virus could account for the differences in how it has infected, sickened and killed people, said Alan Wu, a UC San Francisco professor who runs the clinical chemistry and toxicology laboratories at San Francisco General Hospital.

Medical experts have speculated in recent weeks that they were seeing at least two strains of the virus in the U.S., one prevalent on the East Coast and another on the West Coast, according to Wu.

“We are looking to identify the mutation,” he said, noting that his hospital has had only a few deaths out of the hundreds of cases it has treated, which is “quite a different story than we are hearing from New York.”

The Los Alamos study does not indicate that the new version of the virus is more lethal than the original. People infected with the mutated strain appear to have higher viral loads. But the study’s authors from the University of Sheffield found that among a local sample of 447 patients, hospitalization rates were about the same for people infected with either virus version.

Even if the new strain is no more dangerous than the others, it could still complicate efforts to bring the pandemic under control. That would be an issue if the mutation makes the virus so different from earlier strains that people who have immunity to them would not be immune to the new version.

If that is indeed the case, it could make “individuals susceptible to a second infection,” the study authors wrote.

It’s possible that the mutation changes the spike in some way that helps the virus evade the immune system, said Montefiori, who has worked on an HIV vaccine for 30 years. “It is hypothetical.

He Previously Wrote For The Paper S National Desk.']",2020-05-05,White House may close its coronavirus task force this month,"Although the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, the White House plans to wind down the task force that is guiding the federal government’s response and hand off responsibility to individual agencies, a move aimed at distancing President Trump from potentially unpopular public health decisions as he shifts his focus to the economy and his reelection.

Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that the high-profile task force, which has issued social distancing guidelines and directly advised the president since January, could wrap up in the coming weeks and shift its work to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies.

“I think we’re starting to look at the Memorial Day window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage — begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner,” Pence told reporters.

The task force has met less often in recent days as Trump, following a sharp decline in his approval ratings, has stopped holding nightly televised briefings with Pence, public health officials and other members of the group tasked with charting the administration’s course in the coronavirus crisis.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a crucial member of the task force, appeared caught off guard by the decision, initially denying reports only to have Pence confirm them a short time later.

Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, who heads the White House response team, have sometimes gently corrected Trump’s misguided medical advice, including his dangerous suggestion that injecting household disinfectant could cure COVID-19, and they dissuaded him from lifting stay-at-home guidelines by Easter. Polls show they are far more trusted than the president.

Trump left the Washington area Tuesday for the first time since March to visit a factory in Phoenix that produces protective masks. He donned goggles for the factory tour but did not wear a mask during his visit to a state that this week reported its deadliest day of the pandemic, with 33 deaths on Monday.

Asked about plans to close the White House task force, Trump promised “something in a different form” but suggested its work was complete. He appeared impatient to move on to an economic message, saying the country “is now in the next phase of our battle.”

“We did what was right and now we’re reopening our country,” he said.

The plan to dismantle the group drew immediate concern from some public health officials, who argue that the lack of clear central authority has hindered the nation’s response to a disease that already has killed over 71,000 Americans.

“The concept that we might declare victory prematurely is dangerous from a public health perspective,” said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Johns Hopkins training program in HIV epidemiology and prevention science.

“Too-early lifting of restrictions where community transmission is still underway could lead to an overall prolonging of the U.S. epidemic and to the loss of more American lives — and jobs,” he said.

Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the overseas Ebola response for the Obama administration, noted that infections are rising outside New York, while testing and equipment needs remain unfulfilled. The biggest growth in cases is among those unable to maintain distance — in prisons and at long-term care facilities and high-risk job sites.

Konyndyk likened the White House eagerness to portray an end of the crisis to President George W. Bush’s infamous aircraft carrier appearance beneath a “Mission Accomplished” banner in May 2003, when the war in Iraq was years from completion, a blunder that haunted his presidency.

“Mission abandoned is more like it,” Konyndyk said of the Trump administration. “I’m dumbfounded there’s progress they could cite that would justify anything other than doubling down. The fire is still burning where it’s still finding oxygen and we’re about to give it a bunch more oxygen.”

Robert Hecht, who teaches global health policy and epidemiology at Yale University, said a task force tied to the White House should be kept in place to convey presidential leadership in a “grave crisis.” Disbanding it weakens the ability of Fauci, Birx and other public health officials to align their judgments with economic decisions, he said.

“Perhaps this is why the president and [vice president] want to disband it — to lower the profile and influence of the honest and cautionary messages of Fauci and Birx, so Trump can inject his ‘Happy Time Tunes’ without any dissenting voices,” he said.

Trump has sought in recent weeks to shift responsibility to governors and mayors to begin lifting the lockdown orders that have ground the American economy to a halt and undermined his reelection bid.

With Trump increasingly urging states to reopen, governors and mayors have begun to issue a conflicting patchwork of guidelines, with some states locked down for weeks ahead and others starting to open beaches, businesses and parks.

The president has given mixed signals, attacking Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, for refusing to ease her state’s stay-at-home order, and then blasting Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, after he became the first to lift restrictions.

Trump also has repeatedly signaled that despite data to the contrary, the worst of the pandemic has passed — and that he deserves the credit.

“People are starting to feel good now,” Trump said in an interview Monday with the New York Post in which he also declared, “the one thing that the pandemic has taught us is that I was right.”

Polling paints a different picture. By 63% to 29%, Americans are more concerned about lifting restrictions too quickly than not quickly enough, according to a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday.

It also showed the president’s approval rating dipping to 43%, with 51% disapproving of his job performance. It found that 55% of Americans think Trump has been “largely inconsistent” in his news briefings.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are eager to call Fauci and other members of the task force to testify under oath about the administration’s response. The White House initially said Fauci was too busy to attend a hearing in the Democratic-led House, but Trump offered another reason Tuesday.

“The House is a bunch of Trump haters,” he said.

He added, “They, frankly, want our situation to be unsuccessful, which means death. Which means death. And our situation is going to be very successful.”

Trump said he planned to allow Fauci to testify before a Republican-controlled Senate committee.

The president’s visit to the Honeywell International mask production assembly line in Phoenix had all the hallmarks of a Trump campaign rally. He riffed about his 2016 win in the state, praised a senator running for reelection, and several people, some decked out in Trump 2020 gear, trooped to the stage to offer effusive praise for him.

In a city beaten down by more than 19,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19, De Blasio began his daily briefing by holding the newspaper up to the camera and delivering an attack at the man staring back at him from the page.

“The president of the United States, a former New Yorker who seems to enjoy stabbing his hometown in the back,” De Blasio said. “What kind of human being sees the suffering here and decides that the people of New York City don’t deserve help?

“Well, I’ll tell you something. Every day President Trump resembles more and more Herbert Hoover, the president who ignored the Great Depression, who didn’t care to put America back on its feet. President Trump wasn’t there for us when we needed testing to stop this horrible disease, and now he’s talking about not helping us in our hour of need. He says he’s not inclined to do bailouts, but he gave a $58-billion bailout to the airline industry and gave a $1.5-trillion bailout to big corporations and the wealthy.

“He’s a pure hypocrite.”

Nearly two months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has not yet passed a stimulus plan that sends help to the states for managing their growing debts. The $2.2-trillion stimulus passed in late March sent $150 billion to states but was limited to direct use helping with the public health emergency.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that the state has a $13-billion debt, created in large part by the loss of tax revenue since the novel coronavirus outbreak shut down the economy, an amount that makes an eventual reopening impossible without federal aid.

Other states announced Tuesday that they are facing major financial strife. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said that his state will cut $775 million from its budget the next two months. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said his state projects a $2.4-billion deficit because of the virus’ impact.

“There is a long winter ahead. COVID-19 is upending life as we know it — and our economy will not be spared,” Walz tweeted.

In Trump’s interview with the Post, he addressed the question of whether to offer support to states along political lines.

“It’s not fair to the Republicans because all the states that need help — they’re run by Democrats in every case,” Trump said. “Florida is doing phenomenal, Texas is doing phenomenal, the Midwest is, you know, fantastic — very little debt. … I don’t think the Republicans want to be in a position where they bail out states that are, that have been mismanaged over a long period of time.”

Advertisement

To that idea, De Blasio responded: “The president is playing politics while people are suffering. He says it right out loud there. Who cares who runs the states? The people need help! Because they live in a state or city run by a Democrat, does that make them less American in your view, Mr. President? It’s absolutely unacceptable. We’ve never seen anything like it in the entire history of this republic.

“All we’re asking to do is get back on our feet so we can contribute to this national recovery. There’s not going to be a national recovery without New York City.”

Cuomo, who has been bringing up this topic for weeks, used a more measured approach Tuesday during his briefing. He said that New York state had added $116 billion to federal coffers since 2015 and that many Democratic-governed states have given far more to the federal government than they take out. New York and other Democratic-run states with high COVID-19 case numbers such as California and Illinois weren’t seeking federal help until the pandemic, he said. In New York state, the disease has killed more than 25,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Cuomo said the “mismanagement” rested with America’s partisan Congress.

“The virus doesn’t pick Democrats or Republicans. It doesn’t kill Democrats and Republicans. It kills Americans,” Cuomo said. “... If we can’t get past this now, when can we ever get past it?”

Cuomo did not attack Trump as directly as De Blasio did, saying he believed the president was simply adopting talking points from other influential Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

But Cuomo did issue a challenge to the White House: The next federal stimulus package must include help for state and local governments — or Trump will have cemented an unfavorable place in history.

“The president is looking at a scenario where either he is responsible and bridges the gap or they will not pass any legislation and then he will have failed, and this nation will suffer,” Cuomo said.

This back-and-forth between Trump and the New York leaders comes a day after the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington raised its projection for American deaths from COVID-19 by August from 72,433 to 134,000.

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 71,000 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University, with confirmed cases exceeding 1.2 million.

IHME’s projections reflect “the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11,” it said in a statement, “indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus.”

On Monday, Cuomo announced a detailed plan for reopening his state that would begin May 15 on a region-by-region basis. On Tuesday, though, he wanted to be clear about what reopening means.

“The fundamental question, which we’re not articulating, is, how much is a human life worth?” Cuomo said. “There is a cost of staying closed, no doubt, an economic cost. There’s also a cost of reopening quickly. The faster we reopen, the lower the economic cost but the higher the human cost because of more lives lost. That, my friends, is the decision we are really making.

“To me, I say, the cost of a human life is priceless. Period.”

Cuomo announced that New York lost 230 more lives on Monday, up from 226 the day before.

He took heat from reporters Tuesday as New York reported more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities. At least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state’s nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Cuomo late Monday that includes people believed to have been killed by the disease before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test.

The jump in deaths drew fresh attention to the state’s March 25 policy that said “no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.”

Cuomo said that nursing homes have the right to deny a COVID-19 patient’s return and that the state has facilities for such patients to stay between a visit to the hospital and returning to the nursing home. But Cuomo put the onus on nursing homes to make that call and seek the proper channels.

“We can’t turn hospitals into nursing homes,” he said.

The coronavirus outbreak has devastated nursing homes in many states, including Washington and California.

On Tuesday morning, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis went on Twitter to laud his policies on nursing homes. “In Florida we took swift action to protect our elderly and vulnerable residents in long-term care facilities,” he tweeted, and thanked Fox News for “highlighting these efforts.”

Later, DeSantis appeared at a drive-through testing site in Sarasota, where he held a briefing on where the state stands in its partial reopening. He framed his state — with more than 1,400 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins — as a coronavirus success story, though experts have warned that reopening before a state’s cases have consistently declined and widespread testing is available could cause a second wave.

DeSantis touted his policy that does not allow COVID-19 patients to return to nursing homes without two negative tests. “The other states that send COVID-positive patients back into nursing homes, that’s not been a good standard of practice,” he said. More than 420 residents or staff members at long-term care facilities have died from COVID-19, the state Department of Health reported last week.

The governor also promised that 200,000 antibody tests would be available for Floridians soon.

In New York City, De Blasio said that 140,000 antibody tests were coming available for use by first-responders and healthcare workers. The mayor thanked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for facilitating the help — and he asked for more, from the federal government, and from Trump in particular.

“Anyone watching with a heart and soul would say, ‘I want to help these people because they’ve done something so good, so decent,’ ” De Blasio said. “We’re just asking the president of the United States to care, actually care, about the people of this city, regardless of politics. You’d think a president who grew up here might have a special feeling for this place, might go out of his way to help his hometown. I’ll give him another chance to show that there’s a beating heart there, but these moments today show me something very cold.”

A few hours after De Blasio’s plea, Trump tweeted, “Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse!”

“We have to go through all of the learning that we are going to do of how to [operate] in a COVID-19 world,” Gordon said during a conference call with reporters.

He said the schedule for reopening depends on approval from state health officials. Even then, customers will be asked to wear face masks and observe social-distancing rules inside the offices.

“We want them to be protected,” Gordon said. “We want ourselves to be protected.”

In the meantime, Gordon said, Californians can complete about 97% of DMV transactions online and at remote kiosks and other automated locations. Services available online include vehicle registrations renewals, vehicle title transfers, replacing lost driver’s licenses and temporary license extensions.

“We have done a lot of work over the past several months, building on top of some of the work we were already doing on Real ID, to really expand what we are doing online,” Gordon said.

Taking the written driving test, getting a photo for a license and taking an on-the-road driving test to qualify for a license must be done in person.

Road tests will be delayed for some weeks because of the close proximity required for tester and driver, Gordon said.

The DMV shut its field offices on March 27 amid concerns by employees and the public about the risk of transmitting the coronavirus in crowded offices where customers typically face long waits.

Since then, employees have been operating a DMV Virtual Office, where customers can transact business with help from workers.

Some pressure was relieved when the federal government approved a one-year delay in the deadline for people to apply for a Real ID card.

The DMV has also extended driver’s license expiration dates for residents younger than 70 until May 31.

In addition, the agency granted 120-day extensions for licenses of drivers 70 and older, a group that is particularly vulnerable to the virus and under caution to stay at home.

The DMV also said commercial driver licenses expiring between March and June are valid through June 30.

Gordon said Tuesday that work is underway to make the field offices safe for a return by the public.

Gavin Newsom announced his latest plans for easing stay-at-home restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Businesses such as bookstores, clothing stores, florists and sporting goods stores will be eligible to open for curbside pickup, according to County Executive Officer Michael Powers. Associated manufacturers and supply chains for these retail stores will also be allowed to open.

The county is expected to receive more guidance from the governor’s office before Friday on how such openings should be handled.

“Social distancing will stay with us for a while,” said Rigoberto Vargas, the county’s public health director, during Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting.

Vargas told the board that health officials are proceeding with optimism and caution, and that they’ll monitor the opening in case they need to reinstate stay-at-home measures.

Powers, board members and county Public Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin commended residents for abiding by state and county rules, even with restricted access to beaches.

Levin reflected back to 10 weeks ago, when the pandemic started to have an impact on everyday life and when he first estimated that there would be 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the county. His estimate later dropped to 250. As of Tuesday, the county had reported 19 coronavirus-related deaths.

“It’s so easy to forget what you prevented by your actions,” he said.

As of Tuesday, Ventura County had reported a total of 595 COVID-19 cases. The county also reported 22 current hospitalizations, with 11 patients under intensive care. There have been 416 recovered cases.

"['Staff Writer', 'Emily Alpert Reyes Covers City Hall For The Los Angeles Times.']",2020-05-05,Voices from the spectrum: Autistic people deal with the coronavirus,"When the coronavirus hit Southern California, Hector Ramirez tried to hang on to some of the guideposts in his usual routine: Waking up at 6 a.m. each day. Making his bed. Showering. Heading out to walk his service dog in his Chatsworth neighborhood.

Ramirez, who is autistic, used to try to greet at least 30 people before he returned home, a ritual that grounded him and connected him to the world. Now his walks are quiet; his routine, disrupted.

But Ramirez has had to cope with such stresses before. “Like many people with disabilities, I’ve dealt with social isolation whether I wanted it or not,” said Ramirez, 45, who spent part of his youth in an institution in Camarillo, separated from his family. “I have years of experience being separate from society.”

Autistic people have diverse experiences that resist easy generalization. But in recent interviews, a number of autistic adults say that although the pandemic can be especially stressful for people on the spectrum, many are practiced in dealing with the challenges — social isolation, disrupted routines, economic strain — that are now affecting the general population. And they hope that those experiences might help people who aren’t autistic to better understand them.

Uncertainty, unexpected events and a lack of control are “the major stressors for people on the spectrum,” said Barry M. Prizant, an adjunct professor at Brown University and author of “Uniquely Human: A Different Way of Seeing Autism.” Now that the coronavirus has hit, “that’s so much of what we’re talking about, as they are now major stress factors for neurotypical people — the rest of us.”

Maxfield Sparrow, writing in reaction to an article about people feeling drained as they try to read faces on video calls, points out that “we Autists live with these discomforts all our lives.”

And Sparrow adds: “If you are socially disoriented by Zoom and desperate for the pandemic to be over so you can return to comfortable, easy socializing, please lean into that feeling and remember it later.”

A wide spectrum

Autism is a developmental disability that can affect how people think, communicate, move, interact socially and process sensory information. It can shape how people live in a wide range of ways: Some autistic people need support with day-to-day living skills, while others live independently.

Some people on the spectrum are extremely verbal, while others may have limited or no speech and instead communicate in other ways. Some are keenly interested in specific topics. And many people with autism also have other disabilities that affect their day-to-day lives.

To make sense of a world that can be stressful and unpredictable, many autistic people have found comfort in routines or other coping mechanisms that address their unique needs. Routines, Prizant said, provide a “road map” for making the world more predictable.

“All human beings benefit from predictability in their lives,” Prizant added. “People on the spectrum crave it because there are so many more stressors in their lives.”

Many of those stresses have been exacerbated by the coronavirus. Julia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said her group is deeply concerned that some autistic people might not be able to receive needed assistance with day-to-day tasks such as getting dressed, preparing meals or managing medication — services usually provided at home or in the community.

Children and teens on the autism spectrum may not be getting the added support they usually have in school, or they may be having trouble processing their online lessons.

And college students who are autistic have had to cope with campus closures as well. Mandy Wall, a Sarah Lawrence College senior who is about to graduate and who uses the pronoun “they,” said that when they first left campus and rejoined their parents in Connecticut, they “could barely function.” Sleep was impossible without a Xanax.

“My boyfriend had to remind me to brush my teeth and take a shower,” Wall said.

During the pandemic, autistic advocates have been especially alarmed that some states have set out guidelines for rationing ventilators and prioritizing healthcare, which, Bascom says, are “very clearly a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.”

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration was blasted by advocates for people with disabilities for initially advising hospitals to prioritize younger patients with longer life expectancy — guidelines that were then quietly removed and replaced.

And if all of those worries aren’t enough to process during the pandemic, adults with autism — who already tend to be economically marginalized — are also dealing with the stress of the economic collapse.

Ray Borene, an autistic 32-year-old who lives in Pennsylvania, recently had to stop working at “the only job I was ever able to succeed at.”

Borene, who was not diagnosed until adulthood, said that sensory issues led them to drop out of college and quit a string of jobs where they felt taxed by noise and bright lights. It wasn’t until Borene found work teaching pottery at a community studio that they thrived.

“I could really control my schedule. It’s very tactile. And instead of talking to people all day, it was hands on,” Borene said. “I really connected to the students.”

Advertisement

Then the coronavirus hit and the studio had to shut down, since “there’s no way of sterilizing everything.” Borene, who cannot drive, is now back at home at “a completely new level of isolation.”



Coping with stress

The pandemic has also highlighted the ways in which some autistic people have learned to cope with the kinds of stresses that now preoccupy the broader population.

“Being autistic, over the course of my life I’ve had to become very adept at creating coping mechanisms for things,” said Kris Guin, an autistic transgender man who lives in Washington, D.C. “The first couple of weeks were the hardest. But then I sort of learned to shift gears.”

Some people on the spectrum quip that they’re already pros at “social distancing” — either because social interaction can be stressful or because they have had to cope with unwanted isolation.

Carly Fulgham, president of Autism Society Ventura County, says that being able to step away from face-to-face interaction is a bit of a relief.

“Not having in-person interactions actually makes things easier,” said Fulgham, who was diagnosed with autism as an adult. Whenever she is talking to someone and they cross their arms, Fulgham said she becomes distracted trying to parse their behavior, wondering, “Does that mean they’re cold, or do they not want to talk to me anymore?”

And for autistic people who were bullied as children, Fulgham added, “social isolation can be a coping mechanism to keep themselves from being hurt again.”

Ido Kedar, a 23-year-old autistic author and student who lives in West Hills, had no way to communicate until he was 7 and started using a letter board. Kedar said in an email that “I laugh thinking that finally my autism is an advantage in life.”

“Yes, my many years being cut off from others makes me used to it, though I can’t say I like it,” Kedar wrote, explaining that those experiences had made him introverted.

As an introvert, “we need fewer people in our day,” he said, “but we still need people.”

In Phoenix, 46-year-old Carrie Serlin said she misses the people who used to be part of her routine: The bus drivers from Dial-a-Ride who shuttled her to her job at Social Spin Laundromat, which employs adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities; her supervisors; the people behind the counter where she gets an iced coffee.

At home, she continues to work during the day, braiding laundry baskets out of plastic bags for the laundromat to sell. When she does leave the house, “everyone is so worried about catching something that no one says, ‘Hi,’” she lamented.

Dena L. Gassner, an adjunct professor of autism studies at Towson University in Maryland, said she has seen a divide in how autistic people are faring, from some who say, “I’m living my best life” to others mired in anxiety.

“I worry a great deal about autistic people who don’t have the wherewithal to reach out for resources,” said Gassner, who is autistic and is currently a PhD candidate at Adelphi University on Long Island. “People who catastrophize, whose anxiety is not well-managed, and think in black and white — they’re at great risk right now.”

Ramirez still tries to connect with his neighbors, waving at people beyond his window. When he is out on his walks, sometimes people hold up written messages to him, such as “Nice to see you again” or “Can you help me get some eggs this week?”

He’s stepped up his volunteering at a food pantry that delivers meals, a new routine to restore his sense of purpose.

“People with disabilities are the experts in coping with social isolation,” said Ramirez, who is also a board member with Disability Rights California. “Not because we want to, but because we’ve had to.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/voices-from-the-spectrum-autistic-people-deal-with-the-coronavirus

Coronavirus upends the U.S. food system,"Near downtown Los Angeles, a meat processing plant ramped up production even as it worked to keep frontline employees separated from one another. In Salinas, Calif., a lettuce grower hustled to redirect supply after being forced to plow under unused crops.

In the Bay Area, a food distributor that previously served restaurants started selling produce boxes directly to consumers. Near the Mexico border, a food bank expanded distribution to meet an explosion of need. And in Hollywood, a nonprofit that has served sit-down meals to homeless people for 33 years shifted to takeout.

“We’ve completely had to change what we’re doing,” said Sherry Bonanno, executive director of the Hollywood Food Coalition. “We just keep adapting and adjusting.”

In less time than it takes a farmer to plant and harvest a head of lettuce, the nation’s entire food industry has been flipped on its head by the COVID-19 pandemic. An intricate system for matching supply with demand, established over decades, has been thrown out of whack just as unemployment and food insecurity are skyrocketing among families.

The fallout has been particularly severe in California, where more than a third of the country’s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown — and where hunger and homelessness were already deeply entrenched.

In response, a vast network of food producers, distributors, retailers and advocates have been scrambling to find a new equilibrium, to shore up the nation’s food supply and their own bottom lines while reducing waste and want.

In dozens of interviews, farmers, truckers, grocery executives, restaurateurs, food service providers and food bank administrators from Northern California to the Imperial Valley said the effort has been exhausting, but worth it.

The farmers

It all went haywire March 16, when Gov. Gavin Newsom asked restaurants to close their doors. The food service industry, which supplies restaurants and bars, as well as schools, hotels, production studios and catering services, immediately tanked. As nervous shoppers flocked to grocery stores to stockpile food, retail demand shot up, but not enough to make up for all the lost demand from restaurants.

“It was just a crazy swing,” said Scott Grabau, president and chief executive of Tanimura & Antle, a Salinas-based lettuce producer.

Crops planted months before based on pre-pandemic demand spoiled without buyers. Billions of dollars’ worth of produce went to waste, much of it tilled back into the soil, said Cathy Burns, CEO of the Produce Marketing Assn., which represents produce companies.

Grabau’s company, which grows year-round in California and Arizona, stopped harvesting entire fields. He’s thinking about planting more iceberg and romaine, which grocery shoppers buy, and less of the boutique leaves used by chefs.

Grabau’s team has had to be more agile than ever, packaging produce to fit orders that customers keep changing on the fly. He’s constantly in communication with his employees in the field.

“It’s a walkie-talkie call that says, ‘Hey, stop doing this. This order increased, so start doing this instead,’” Grabau said.

The meat processors

Few parts of the supply chain have been hit as hard as meat processing. Dozens of plants have been shuttered due to coronavirus outbreaks, prompting President Trump last week to order facilities to stay open as a matter of national security. Unions and others have objected, pointing to thousands of infections among meat workers.

Zack Levenson is chief operating officer for Golden West Food Group, based in Vernon, which produces beef, pork and chicken products.

The company, which has not had a known coronavirus infection in any of its facilities, slowed production for a couple of weeks to protect employees but has since maneuvered to expand capacity by millions of pounds of meat per week, Levenson said.

By good fortune, the company just weeks before the pandemic had commissioned the conversion of old dry-packing space in its main facility into more raw-meat processing space. That proved crucial for ramping up production at a time when employees had to be spaced farther apart, Levenson said.

For worker safety, the company began instituting special protocols early on, Levenson said. Masks were introduced, “hand sanitizer is everywhere,” new plastic dividers have been installed, and teams have been isolated, he said.

That way, if a line member gets ill, the company is able to quarantine his or her 10-member team without halting the entire operation.

The truckers

Zach England, chief operating officer of C.R. England, a Utah-based company that hauls produce and meat in refrigerated trucks across California and other states, said the pandemic has created a seesaw effect.

About 4,000 of his company’s 6,000 or so drivers regularly haul food. Demand for their services shot up in the early weeks of the pandemic as grocers struggled to stock shelves, but that has since leveled off.

Overall, there are more haulers on the hunt for work and less freight. Smaller trucking outfits are hurting; owner-operators are being paid less. The logistics involved in keeping truckers working, England said, have been intense.

Greg Dubuque, president of the California Trucking Assn. and owner of Liberty Linehaul West in Montebello, said trucking companies are “just trying to keep our wheels rolling to get to a better day.”

The distributors

Food service is a $303-billion industry, with 350,000 employees delivering 8.7 billion cases of product across the U.S. annually, according to Mark Allen, president and CEO of the International Foodservice Distributors Assn.

The industry “walked off the cliff” when restaurants and other businesses closed in the middle of March, with most distributors losing 60% to 90% of their volume, Allen said.

Ed Maybrun, owner of Cotati Food Service in Sonoma County, lost about 80% of his business overnight and has been hustling to stay afloat since.

He started storing more food for big customers in his freezers and looking for new inventory to sell. He took on deliveries for a local food bank and started breaking apart industrial-size packages of bread, paper products and other staples to sell directly to consumers.

“I’ve never worked so much for such a small piece of business in my life,” Maybrun said.



The restaurants

When the restaurants shuttered, a shock wave rippled out from owners and managers to servers, bartenders, dishwashers and cooks. It wasn’t pretty.

“We went straight into panic mode,” said Curtis Stone, the Australian chef who has cooked for the likes of Oprah Winfrey and has two high-end restaurants in the Los Angeles area: Maude and Gwen.

“We were like, ‘Oh my God, how do we just stay in business and make sure everyone gets their next paycheck?’” Stone said.

At first, there was no way. He simply couldn’t afford to keep on more than a dozen or so staff.

But that has since changed.

At Gwen, which always functioned in part as a butchery, Stone and his managers turned the restaurant into a sort of neighborhood market. They started doing a modest trade on eggs and milk, boxes of produce and prime cuts of meat.

They joined food delivery apps to connect with more customers. They created a new menu of comfort food for takeout. And they started replicating the process at Maude, which previously had been an exclusive 24-seat, three-course dining experience.

As the new model began to catch hold, Stone found he was able to start bringing staffers back.

“We made a decision early on as a team to not stand around and talk about how bad it is,” he said. “We just don’t have the time to be unproductive.”

The grocers

In the first weeks of the shutdown, customers cleared grocery shelves faster than they could be restocked, even though inventory was streaming in from suppliers. Shoppers were buying four to eight weeks worth of food at once.

There weren’t enough trucks to handle the demand, said Nancy Lebold, vice president of merchandising for Food 4 Less, a value grocer with a large customer base in the Latino community. At times, big orders just wouldn’t show up.

Normally, fruit accounts for 60% of produce sales, and vegetables the remainder. The first week of the shutdown, they flip-flopped, Lebold said, and have stayed that way ever since.

Advertisement

Other patterns of food consumption also were upended as people became reacquainted with their kitchens, and some automated supply processes were slow to respond, said Manny Vivanco, regional logistics director for the Kroger Co., which owns Ralphs and Food 4 Less.

Food 4 Less operates three inventory warehouses in the Los Angeles region: one in Paramount that is 98% automated, one in Compton that is about half-automated and one in Riverside that is not automated, relying instead on frontline associates.

As demand surged, the automated warehouses couldn’t keep up, Vivanco said. Meanwhile, workers in Riverside were cranking out increased orders.

In recent weeks, Kroger and other grocers have been trying to keep stores stocked even as dozens of workers have become ill, and unions have protested what they say are management failures to protect them.

The food banks

The COVID-19 chaos severely diminished the supply of free food to food banks, just as need surged.

Millions of Californians have lost work due to the pandemic. Many have been left hungry.

Advertisement

In the first three weeks of April, nearly 265,000 people applied for government food assistance under the CalFresh program — more than double the number who applied during the same period last year — according to the California Department of Social Services, which administers the program.

The number of people arriving at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano has doubled, said Cassidie Bates, the organization’s policy and advocacy manager.

“We have seen a completely new population emerge,” Bates said.

Meanwhile, grocery stores are selling more of their stock and passing on less food. Restaurants and other businesses that closed had lots of inventory to hand off to food banks in the first days of the shutdown, but that supply has run dry. And what was pulled in at the start of the pandemic has largely gone out the door already.

Advertisement

Food banks normally stockpile at this time of year, but demand is too high to hold back anything, Bates said.

The Imperial Valley Food Bank near the southern border, which normally serves 20,000 people each month, served more than 26,000 in the first three weeks of April, said Sara Griffen, the executive director.

Many of the food bank’s clients are farmworkers who have lost hours, a particularly cruel irony.

Griffen said local farmers have provided produce, but she still worries about protein, having recently received word that “quite a few” of her expected meat shipments had been canceled, likely due to closures of meat processing plants, she said.

The advocates

On a recent afternoon, Bonanno of the Hollywood Food Coalition was moving a mile a minute. She’s always busy, but more so with the move to a new model where clients no longer stream inside for warm meals but get handed their food outside.

“Everything is in a to-go bag,” she said.

Advertisement

On top of that, Bonanno said, her normal supply chains have collapsed.

Her group has long received food from the movie studios. A single day of production on a film or television set could yield enough leftover meals for hundreds of people on any given night. Now, all the studios have closed. Caterers, restaurants and groceries are providing less, too.

“Normally there’s tons of overproduction of food, and lots of different organizations will try to scramble to take that,” she said. “What’s been disrupted is the regular restaurant, caterers and grocery-store distribution system.”

Rick Nahmias, executive director of Food Forward, a nonprofit that collects food for redistribution, said his organization has been ramping up efforts in the face of huge need.

He started the group a decade ago, harvesting unused fruit from a single tree in his backyard. It grew to handling 2 million pounds of food per month. Amid the pandemic, it’s handling 800,000 pounds a week, scrambling to redirect excess farm produce to places like the Hollywood Food Coalition.

At distribution points where food is given directly to hungry Californians, “food that would last for three hours just a few months ago is now gone in five, 10, 15 minutes,” Nahmias said.



The future

Across the nation’s food web, people are nervous and frustrated. There is great need, but there is also hope for a future with less waste and more humanity.

“The whole world is trying to figure out how to rebalance the supply and demand,” said Chris Tang, a supply chain expert and professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. “We have so much food being wasted. The question is, how do you reduce the food waste so that the food will actually get to the people in need?”

Already, new lines of communication are opening between producers and those on the front lines of poverty and hunger. Tang hopes that government and the private sector will do even more to link the two. California, with its tech hubs and massive farms, could take the lead.

He sees a new, nationwide online platform where those with food can immediately be paired up with those who need it.

Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order. But as the fight against the pandemic evolves and summer nears, the rules are rapidly changing, especially at beaches.

On Tuesday, Laguna Beach beaches opened after weeks of closure, but they will be open only from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. weekdays, for active use only, under a deal reached between local and state officials. They will remain closed on weekends.

In San Clemente too beaches reopened after an agreement between state and local leaders. In that case, the city’s beaches will be open daily for active use only (no fishing or sunbathing). The city’s pier reopened Tuesday with social distancing requirements. Beach restrooms and parking remain closed.

On Tuesday morning, state officials released letters authorizing Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Seal Beach officials to open their beaches. The letters, sent by Mark S. Ghilarducci, director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services; and Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the state Natural Resources Agency, say the cities have drafted beach management plans that conform with state rules, and the state urges local officials that “vigilance will be necessary” to keep citizens safe.

Meanwhile in the city of Los Angeles, officials said plans are in the works to completely close L.A.'s Griffith Park and other city parks on Mother’s Day (Sunday), in the same way those parks were closed on Easter to discourage crowds from gathering. No official announcement has been made, but those parks are likely to shut at sunset Saturday and reopen Monday morning.

Conflicts between cautious state officials and restless local leaders came to a head Thursday, when Newsom overruled local Orange County officials to close beaches in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach after they drew substantial weekend crowds. Most Orange County beaches remain closed under the governor’s action.

L.A. County’s beaches are still closed through May 15 under the county’s Safer at Home order, and local, state and federal agencies throughout the region are severely limiting access to hundreds of beaches, parks, trails and forests.

Ventura and San Diego counties have been gradually opening their beaches. In both of those counties, as in Orange County, officials have closed beach-adjacent parking lots, hoping to encourage people to stay within their own walking neighborhoods.

Here’s an update on what’s happening where. If you do go outside for a walk, remember these tips for keeping safe. Local and state officials stress the need to take greater care in maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others.



Los Angeles city parks, beaches and markets

City Recreation and Parks officials say most most park areas “remain open for walking and running.” But they are enforcing a range of restrictions. Among them: All public hiking trails and trailheads in the city of Los Angeles have been closed since March 27.

Also closed are all public beaches, public beach parking lots, beach bathrooms, piers, beach access points and the Venice Boardwalk and Ocean Front Walk (with limited access to essential businesses).

All recreation centers, aquatic facilities, golf courses, skate parks, tennis courts, playgrounds, baseball fields, soccer fields and basketball courts are also closed, as are other “indoor and outdoor sport amenities.”

In Griffith Park, authorities have closed all facilities and trails, including the Observatory, Travel Town, train rides, the pony rides, the merry-go-round and some roads. But the bicycle rental operation has been open.

Los Angeles County trails and beaches

Since March 27, L.A. County officials have enforced the closure of trails, trailheads, beaches and other public lands. (This list details closures.) All of the county’s park play and sports amenities, including golf courses, are also closed.

Los Angeles County’s beaches, piers, beach bike paths, beach access points, public trails, trailheads and tennis courts are also closed, under an order that covers beaches in every coastal city and unincorporated area of the county.

Parks officials noted on their website that “you can still enjoy time outdoors at your local park for passive use, such as walking, jogging, or leisure time outdoors for individuals or families. Social distancing is still required, and group gatherings are prohibited by the health order.”

Since March 23, the county has forbidden use of its multiuse trail system, a network of more than 220 miles that includes popular Eaton Canyon Trail; all interior trails at Vasquez Rocks; all interior trails at Placerita Canyon; the Loop Trail, Devil’s Chair and South Fork Trail at Devil’s Punchbowl; the San Dimas Nature Trail; the Schabarum-Skyline Trail; and dozens of other popular routes.



Los Angeles County beach cities and Catalina Island

• In Santa Monica, city beaches, the beach bike path and Ocean Front Walk closed March 27 as part of the countywide order to shut down beaches. The city’s Palisades Park, which overlooks the beach and pier, is also closed.

• In Hermosa Beach, the pier, Strand and beach itself are closed as part of the countywide beach closure.

• In Redondo Beach the pier, Strand and beach also are closed. City officials closed the Esplanade area; Veterans Park and nearby parking areas; all public walkways, stairways, ramps and paths to the beach; and a coastal bluff trail between Knob Hill Avenue and George Freeth Way.

• On Catalina Island, the Catalina Chamber of Commerce is urging non-residents to stay away. The Catalina Express, which usually runs boats to the island’s Avalon and Two Harbors landings from Long Beach, San Pedro and Dana Point, has cut back its service to two round trips a day between Long Beach and Avalon. At the Catalina Flyer, which normally offers one departure daily from Newport Beach to Avalon, a phone recording warned that the boat has suspended service until further notice. The Catalina Island Conservancy has closed its visitor facilities, services and trails.



State parks in Southern California

On March 18, state parks officials closed all state campgrounds. On March 29, they tightened restrictions further, closing vehicle access to the entire state park system — 280 parks, including off-road vehicle areas.

Since then, the state has fully closed dozens of parks, banning pedestrians as well as vehicles. Among them: The Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve; more than a dozen state parks and beaches in L.A. County; San Clemente State Beach in Orange County; seven state beaches in San Diego County; and four state beaches and parks in Ventura County.

But more recently, some parks have quietly reopened, while still keeping their roadways and parking lots closed to discourage visitors from outside the immediate area. On Monday morning, Carlsbad, South Carlsbad and Torrey Pines state beaches reopened that way, with visitors limited to active recreation and no group gatherings.

At Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area in the Baldwin Hills area of L.A., officials said in a statement that the park is closed to vehicular access but “remains open for locals who wish to walk, hike and bike (in parks with bike trails) in the park, provided they practice social/physical distancing of 6 feet or more. This is not the time for a road trip to a destination park or beach.”



San Gabriel Valley

In the first week of April, Pasadena city officials closed the Rose Bowl Loop, a popular 3.1-mile- walking path around the famed stadium.

The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino is closed through at least May 15.

Descanso Gardens in La Cañada Flintridge is closed until further notice. The L.A. Arboretum in Arcadia is open; reservations are required to prevent crowding.

Santa Monica Mountains

The National Park Service has imposed weekend closures on all Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area trails, trailheads, restrooms, overlooks and pullouts in Ventura County. Authorities said those areas will remain open on weekdays, when crowds are thinner.

Those weekend closures begin at 2 p.m. Fridays and reopen at 6 a.m. Mondays “until further notice,” an NPS release said.

That policy covers Rancho Sierra Vista (including the Wendy Trailhead); Cheeseboro Canyon Trailhead; the Deer Creek area; and all trails within Circle X, which includes Sandstone Creek, Mishe Mokwa, the Grotto Trail, the trails and overlooks along Yerba Buena Road and the Backbone Trail along the spine of the Santa Monicas.

As part of the earlier L.A. County-wide closure of hiking trails, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area had already shut down all of its trails and restrooms in L.A. County.

Also, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority on March 23 closed all of its parklands, trail and facilities — close to 75,000 acres of parkland, including all parks owned by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.

The authority’s busiest parks, now closed, include Wilacre Park in Studio City; Temescal Gateway Park in Pacific Palisades; Franklin Canyon Park off Mulholland Drive, Beverly Hills; Ed Davis Park in Towsley Canyon, the Santa Clarita Valley; all the overlooks on Mulholland Drive; Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve at the west end of Victory Boulevard; and Escondido Canyon Park in Malibu.



Ventura County

• Ventura County has allowed the opening of county-managed beaches, golf courses and bike shops among various modifications to its Stay Well at Home order. That order, which continues to close campgrounds, gyms, swimming pools and many other facilities, is effective through May 15.

•The city of Ventura on April 20 reopened its beaches, pier, promenade and parks, subject to requirements that people keep their distance and don’t linger.

• The city of Port Hueneme, experimenting with a “soft reopening,” has reopened its beach (and a parking lot) to walking, running, biking and solo surfing and paddleboarding, but said it would discourage sunbathing or any “stationary presence” on the sand. Its pier, restrooms, playground and street parking remain closed.



Orange County

On April 25 and 26, many of the county’s shores, especially in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, were so crowded that photographs alarmed many people. The governor was one of them, and he briefly shut all of Orange County’s beaches.

Since then, state officials have negotiated terms for reopening several cities’ beaches in the county. This list covers the beaches city by city.

Parking lots at all county beaches, regional and wilderness parks remain closed as well. So are parking spaces at all trailheads; parking lots at Irvine Lake; parking along Black Star Canyon Road; pedestrian access points at Thousand Steps, Table Rock, West, Camel Point and Treasure Island beaches; restrooms; playgrounds; exercise equipment; shelters and trailheads. Pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians were permitted.

Orange County also banned vehicular traffic to Carbon Canyon, Clark, Craig, Irvine, Laguna Niguel, Mason, Mile Square, Tri-City and Yorba regional parks. Pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians were permitted.

Orange County’s Supervisors have cleared the way for public and private golf courses to open.

Throughout Los Angeles County

The Safer at Home order from Los Angeles County Public Health officials, issued March 21 and updated April 10, prohibits all public and private group events and gatherings through May 15. It also says that individuals and families are not prohibited from “hiking, walking, biking or shopping at [e]ssential [b]usinesses,” as long as they keep their distance from others.

The order also notes that if local entities (such as municipal governments) choose to impose stricter limits, the county order does not supersede them.

Los Angeles County has closed all indoor and outdoor playgrounds, along with indoor shopping centers and all swap meets and flea markets.



Inland Empire

• San Bernardino County on April 25 reopened county parks, lakes, rivers and recreation areas. “Private and city-owned parks, trails, lakes and golf courses also opened on a limited basis,” the L.A. Times Luke Money reports. Big Morongo Canyon Preserve and Mojave River Forks Regional Park are still closed.

• Riverside County leaders on April 20 allowed golf courses to reopen, with restrictions. Hiking, bikes and horseback-riding on trails and in parks are also permitted under the county’s health order.



San Diego County parks and beaches

San Diego County Board of Supervisors reopened county-run beaches there April 27 to swimming, surfing, kayaking and paddle-boarding but not group activities, sunbathing or boating.

City-by-city details are covered in this list.

Most of San Diego County’s parks and preserves have remained open for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians, but their parking lots and many facilities and amenities are closed.



National forests in Southern California

The U.S. Forest Service has closed campgrounds, picnic areas, bathrooms and other developed recreation sites in its California forests through May 15, leaving Southern California’s four forests — Angeles, Cleveland, Los Padres and San Bernardino — to make their own decisions on trail access and parking.

• In the Angeles National Forest, authorities on April 3 closed 23 well-used San Gabriel mountain trails, four popular trailheads and 19 roads.

This map shows the affected areas. The closures include the Millard Canyon above Altadena, San Antonio Falls, Icehouse Canyon and North Devil’s Backbone trailheads.

The forest order shuts routes to Echo Mountain and Mt. Lowe, such as the Sam Merrill Trail, above Altadena, as well as others leading to Mt. Wilson, San Gabriel Peak, the Rim Trail and other routes in the San Gabriel Mountains.

• In the San Bernardino National Forest, whose 680,000 acres include four mountain ranges in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, a spokesman said trails, trailheads, staging areas that function as trailheads and parking areas at trailheads remain open. Hikers should practice social distancing, sticking to wide fire roads instead of single-track trails that are too narrow, the spokesman said.

• In Los Padres National Forest, which includes about 1.95 million acres reaching north from Ventura County into Central California, spokesman Andrew Madsen said trailhead parking and trails remain open, as do dispersed camp sites in the backcountry.

Advertisement

• In Cleveland National Forest, which reaches into San Diego, Riverside and Orange counties, the list of sites closed includes all trails and picnic areas where an Adventure Pass is usually required.

In the forest’s Trabuco ranger district, closures include: El Cariso north/south picnic area; Hot Springs trailhead; San Juan loop trailhead; Tenaja trailhead; Trabuco creek picnic area; Wildomar staging area; Maple Springs day-use area.

In the forest’s Descanso Ranger District, closures include Agua Dulce; Bear Valley OHV (off-highway vehicle) area; and Corral Canyon.

In the forest’s Palomar Ranger District, closures include Crestline; Henshaw scenic vista; Inaja Memorial; Kica Mik Overlook; Palomar Mountain Interpretive Station; San Luis Rey Picnic Area; Fry Creek Trailhead; Observatory Trailhead; and Barker Valley Trailhead. The popular Cedar Creek Falls and Three Sisters Falls trails have been closed since March 21.

Gavin Newsom has announced that some stay-at-home rules will be modestly eased later this week.

He said details would be provided later in the week, but here are some highlights:

Businesses that can open

Bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, sporting goods retailers, clothing stores and others can reopen for pickup as early as Friday. Additional businesses could be named later this week, also with curbside pickup.

Advertisement

Right now, only essential businesses such as grocery stores, drug stores, medical offices, gas stations and auto repair are open, with social distancing. Factories that supply those businesses would also be allowed to resume.

Businesses that can’t

Offices, shopping malls, and seated dining at restaurants are still ordered shut. Personal grooming businesses, entertainment venues, live concerts and sports are also not included in the first phase of Newsom’s reopening plan.

Local controls

Advertisement

There will be more decision-making at the local level, allowing some communities to move further at their own pace instead of adhering to a uniform policy across the state. Some rural counties that have not been hard hit by the coronavirus have been asking for this.

Benchmarks

If counties want to do more, they must first meet certain requirements for hospital beds, testing kits and the ability to track infected people and trace their contacts.

Advertisement

While some counties want to reopen now, other more hard-hit counties in the Bay Area and Southern California are urging caution.

Newsom said communities that reopen businesses more slowly, like the San Francisco Bay Area, can still do so. Pandemic conditions vary widely throughout the state, he said.

Varying conditions

Some counties — Modoc, Yuba and Sutter counties in Northern California — have defied Newsom’s orders and allowed more or all kinds of businesses to reopen beyond the statewide order.

Advertisement

The governor declined to say Monday whether there would be consequences for those counties. He added that the overwhelming majority of California’s 58 counties are doing the right thing.

Los Angeles County’s public health director, Barbara Ferrer, said Monday that officials will be sharing its recovery plans this week. “Wherever it’s possible to safely reopen, we’ll be doing so as quickly as possible,” she said.

California is in Phase One of the governor’s reopening plan. The easing planned for this week would cover Phase Two.

“We are entering into the next phase this week,” Newsom said at his Monday news conference. “This is a very positive sign, and it’s happened only for one reason: The data says it can happen.”

Stage 1: safety and preparedness

This phase is now underway.

Continue to build out testing and contact-tracing capabilities and hospital surge capacity.

Continue to make workplaces as safe as possible for essential workers.

Work on adaptations to the physical setting and workflow in hospitals and other settings.

Build a safety net for essential workforce.

Make personal protective equipment more widely available.

Incorporate individual behavior changes.

Prepare safety guidelines for an expanded force of front-line workers.

Stage 2: Retail and lower-risk workplaces reopen.

Advertisement

Beginning Friday:

More retail stores (with curbside pickup)

Manufacturing and logistics to support retail

Later on:

Offices (when teleworking is not possible)

Additional public spaces

Modified schools programs and child care

Potentially beginning the academic school year in July or August

An expanded workforce safety net could mean:

Wage replacement so workers can stay home when sick.

Adaptions for reopened schools and child-care facilities could mean:

Advertisement

Summer programs and an earlier start to the next academic year, in July or August.

What’s needed to get from Stage 1 to Stage 2?

Government actions:

Enacting policies that allow people to stay home when they’re sick.

Providing guidance on how to reduce coronavirus risk.

Business actions:

Provide wage replacement so workers can stay home when sick.

Implement adaptations to lower-risk workplaces.

Allow employees to continue to work from home when possible.

Individual actions:

Use safety precautions, such as physical distancing and wearing masks.

Avoid all nonessential travel.

Support and care for people who are at high risk.

Key goals to hit before moving to Stage 2:

Hospitalization and ICU trends are stable.

Hospital surge capacity can meet demand.

There is sufficient personal protective equipment to meet demand.

Testing capacity is sufficient to meet demand.

There’s contact-tracing capacity statewide.

The transition to Stage 2 will occur through a statewide modification to the stay-at-home order.

Opportunity for regional variations

Advertisement

During Stage 2, counties may choose to relax stricter local orders at their own pace.

After Stage 2, once a statewide COVID-19 surveillance system is made possible through testing, further regional variations could be supported.

The state will consult and collaborate closely with local governments.

Stage 3: Higher-risk workplaces reopen

The following sectors reopen:

Personal care (hair and nail salons, gyms)

Entertainment venues (movie theaters, sports without live audiences)

In-person religious services (churches, weddings)

Stage 4: Stay-at-home order ends

At this point, therapeutics will have been developed and other key goals met. These events and sites will then reopen:

Concerts

Convention centers

Sports events with live audiences

Worried about getting the coronavirus at work?

While many people are working from home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of Californians with jobs deemed essential still head to their workplaces each day. Are you concerned that your employer isn’t keeping you adequately protected? Samantha Masunaga and Thuc Nhi Nguyen looked into what you can do .

There’s no sugarcoating it: Workers who fear they’re being exposed to the virus on the job are in a tough position. The state agency that enforces workplace safety — California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, known as Cal/OSHA — is receiving a large volume of COVID-19 workplace complaints, and even labor advocates suggest employees think carefully before refusing a boss’ order to perform hazardous work.

“Employers can retaliate, and that retaliation may be illegal, but its consequences will likely be very immediate,” said Stephen Knight, executive director of Worksafe, a worker advocacy group. “Any redress will take much longer to pursue with the system.”

But it’s still critical to keep filing complaints, says Alice Berliner, coordinator for the Southern California Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health. “It’s really important that the state and Cal/OSHA know that COVID cases are still happening in workplaces, that workers are still being put at risk.” You can also file a report with your county’s department of public health. And you can try reaching out to media organizations if there has been a large number of coronavirus cases in your workplace. (The Times is always looking for news tips.)

When bringing up concerns about coronavirus exposure, labor advocates advise, workers should approach their employer as a group — showing that the issue is a collective problem — rather than one by one. Unionized workers can turn to their union representatives, and workers who are not represented by a union may find it helpful to reach out to worker centers or community advocacy groups. A few examples: the Garment Worker Center, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, the Los Angeles Black Worker Center and the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance.

Reader question

A reader asks us: If I filled out my unemployment claim wrong, can I edit it or refile it?

Emmanuel Morgan got in touch with California’s Employment Development Department to track down the answer to this question. If you need to change information on an unemployment claim, you’ll need to contact the EDD , and the department said the most direct way to do that is using the “contact” feature on its UI Online tool.

However, the swell of layoffs and furloughs in the last month means the EDD is receiving a high volume of calls and processing unusually large numbers of claims, so getting immediate attention from a representative may be difficult. It is possible to update your address or phone number through UI Online without having to speak with a representative.

A tip for anyone working from home with a partner or roommates: If you’re having trouble leading a conference call because your significant other has a meeting at the same time, consider starting a shared calendar that includes scheduled meetings for everyone in the household. Quarters might be cramped and voices might be loud, but knowing when others will be speaking can go a long way toward keeping everyone calm .

The lawsuit, brought by state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra and the city attorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, seeks restitution for unpaid wages it says are owed to drivers, and it requests that the court force the companies to immediately classify their drivers as employees.

Filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, the suit argues that Uber and Lyft gave themselves an unfair market advantage by dodging expenses including drivers’ wages and local and state payroll taxes. The law enables plaintiffs to seek up to $2,500 in civil penalties per violation for drivers going back four years.

At a video news conference Tuesday, Becerra said the coronavirus outbreak had laid bare the lack of protections for drivers. “Sometimes it takes a pandemic to shake us,” he said.

Advertisement

The lawsuit comes after California’s Assembly Bill 5, which took effect Jan. 1, established stricter standards for which workers can be treated as independent contractors rather than employees. AB5 empowers California’s attorney general and city attorneys to force companies to provide minimum wage, overtime pay, workers’ compensation, and unemployment and disability insurance to workers who meet the legal test for employee classification.

Gig economy companies have largely opposed the legislation.

Lyft said in a statement it is “looking forward to working with the Attorney General and mayors across the state to bring all the benefits of California’s innovation economy to as many workers as possible, especially during this time when the creation of good jobs with access to affordable healthcare and other benefits is more important than ever.”

Uber, also alluding to the high unemployment caused by the coronavirus crisis, said California should “make it easier, not harder, for people to quickly start earning. We will contest this action in court, while at the same time pushing to raise the standard of independent work for drivers in California, including with guaranteed minimum earnings and new benefits,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

Advertisement

Drivers and labor groups, which have staged rallies calling for the state to enforce AB 5, celebrated the lawsuit.

“Billionaires like to pick and choose what laws they follow,” said Carlos Ramos, a driver and organizer with Gig Workers Rising, an advocacy group that represents on-demand platform workers. “Today, California is showing that no one is above the law, not even big tech.”

Over the years, Uber and Lyft have battled numerous lawsuits alleging the companies have misclassified workers. Since February, more than 2,000 California ride-hailing drivers have filed claims against the companies, alleging Uber and Lyft owe them more than $630 million in lost wages, expenses and damages.

In response to a lawsuit brought by Lyft drivers, a federal judge in San Francisco said last month that drivers are employees under AB 5. “It’s obvious” AB 5 was intended to apply to drivers at companies like Lyft, and refusing to reclassify drivers Lyft is “really disregarding the rule of law,” U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said during a April 2 teleconference, according to Bloomberg .

Advertisement

Still, Chhabria rejected an emergency motion to immediately classify drivers seeking sick pay as employees amid the coronavirus outbreak, saying the case was filed hurriedly and “riddled with defects.”

The companies say they do not employ the drivers but rather act as intermediaries between drivers and riders. They anticipated a crackdown by the state, and have mounted a vehement campaign against AB 5, spending the better part of 2019 working to derail the bill before state lawmakers approved it.

Two days before the law went into effect, Uber and delivery startup Postmates filed a suit alleging that AB 5 violates individuals’ constitutional rights and unfairly discriminates against technology platforms and those who make a living through such platforms.

Uber and Lyft, along with other gig-economy companies, have poured $110 million into a ballot measure in California that could serve as an alternative to AB 5. The measure would create a third category of work in between contracting and employment.

Advertisement

During Tuesday’s news conference, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said the ballot campaign would not affect the state’s lawsuit even if the gig companies are successful in their efforts to overturn AB 5. The law simply codifies and clarifies the state supreme court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West vs. Superior Court, which established the stricter test that determines whether a worker is a contractor or employee. That ruling would remain in effect.

Ride-hailing companies are just one category of California businesses that have pushed back against the new law. For instance, the trade group representing California newspapers has asked lawmakers to exclude newspaper delivery workers from being classified as employees, saying the move could further weaken the fiscal health of some publications. Management of the Los Angeles Times, as well as the paper’s editorial board, has supported that effort.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a briefing Tuesday that he planned to request more money in the state budget for the purpose of enforcing AB 5.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-05-05/california-sues-uber-lyft-alleging-ab5-worker-misclassification

During a hearing, the state’s highest court did not clearly indicate which way it would rule. Only four of the court’s seven justices asked questions, and those who did speak challenged both sides in the dispute.

The court is considering a challenge by unions to a 2012 law that forbade the practice of “pension spiking” for all government employees. The practice involves inflating a future pensioner’s pay, usually at the end of their career, by cashing in years of accumulated vacation or sick pay or volunteering for extra duties.

Because pension payments are calculated based on a worker’s highest year of earnings, spiking can produce a more lucrative retirement than what the employee earned on the job. At least 1 million public employees in California will be affected by the court’s decision.

Advertisement

Unions and public employee groups across the state contend the law violates the 60-year California Rule, which says employees are entitled to the pension they were promised on their first day of work. Courts have ruled that public pensions are contracts protected by the state and U.S. constitutions.

Rei Onishi, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s deputy legal affairs secretary, told the court that governments in California now face massive cutbacks, layoffs and furloughs, a reference to the anticipated budget deficits stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.

He called pension spiking “abusive” and said the practice was “never lawful.” In barring it, he said, the state Legislature merely clarified the law and closed loopholes. He also contended that the law was prospective and therefore did not rob any workers of promised benefits.

Three of the justices appeared skeptical that the changes were merely prospective. “Employees who are currently working might view this as not prospective,” said Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar. “They are arguing they had a set of expectations that are being violated.”

Justice Goodwin Liu also suggested that what is now called pension spiking may have been presumed to be perfectly legal in past years.

David E. Mastagni, representing the Alameda County Deputy Sheriff’s Assn., argued the words “pension spiking” amounted to an “inherently subjective political term.”

He said employees were recruited and told they could depend on the pension rules in place. “My clients were promised they would have deferred compensation,” he said.

Justice Joshua P. Groban, appearing frustrated, asked the lawyer to imagine a “massive economic downturn” and a “doomsday scenario” when pension systems are “on the brink.” He wanted to know: Can there never be any changes?

Mastagni said counties in such cases could ease financial pressures by negotiating additional employee contributions.

In California, the formula for calculating retirement income generally can be changed only if it is neutral or advantageous to employees. It cannot be reduced, except for new hires.

California has been a national leader in pension law, and other states are paying close attention to the outcome of a series of cases testing the government’s ability to make cuts for longtime employees.

After the great recession, former Gov. Jerry Brown tackled the pension shortfall, signing new measures into law. The judiciary, which benefited from past public pension rulings, was exempt from the new cutbacks. Now the pandemic is creating another fiscal crisis for state and local government.

As expected, it wasn’t pretty.

The Burbank giant’s profit dropped dramatically during the three months that ended in March, the month that fears of the COVID-19 pandemic closed Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World, halted film and TV production and suspended live sports indefinitely.

Earnings for the second fiscal quarter fell 63% from the same period last year to 60 cents a share, the company said Tuesday. That was worse than Wall Street anticipated. Analysts polled by FactSet on average had expected 89 cents a share. Net income fell 91% to $475 million.

Disney estimated that the business missed out on $1 billion in operating income because of the theme park closures during the quarter, which ended March 28. About half of the $1-billion hit was from the company’s U.S. theme parks, which were closed for just two weeks during the period. International parks and cruise ships accounted for the rest, Disney said.

Disney closed its domestic parks and Disneyland Paris in mid-March amid the growing public health concerns surrounding the novel coronavirus.

The crisis has taken a major toll on the broader media industry, but Disney in particular has suffered because of its reliance on in-person experiences such as parks, movie theaters, cruise ships and retail stores.

The outbreak came just as Disney was transitioning to new leadership, with Bob Iger stepping aside from the chief executive role in late February to make way for his successor, Bob Chapek, who previously ran the parks and resorts empire.

“The challenges we’re now facing are unprecedented,” Iger said on a call with analysts. However, he added, “I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period.”

To weather the shutdowns, Disney has added billions of dollars to its debt load, slashed executive salaries and furloughed more than 100,000 of its 223,000 employees. The furloughs have hit tens of thousands of parks and cruise workers , as well as employees at the company’s movie studio division.

“We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows,” Chapek said on the call. “While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones.”

The company on Tuesday said it would forgo its semiannual dividend for shareholders, saving about $1.6 billion in cash.

Disney stock fell about 2% in after-hours trading on Wall Street, after the earnings release. Before the financial report, the stock closed down $2.12, or 2%, to $101.06 on Tuesday.

Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield, a frequent critic of the company, described the coronavirus-driven downturn in stark terms in a blog post for clients. “Disney has gone from being on top of the world a la Lion King, to feeling like Eeyore stuck in the middle of a perfect storm with no end in sight,” Greenfield wrote.

Parks, experiences and products — normally the company’s biggest segment in terms of sales — saw revenue fall 10% to $5.54 billion in the quarter. Operating income was $639 million, down 58% from the prior-year second quarter.

Disney’s parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been closed since January, when the outbreak was spreading in China. Tokyo Disneyland shut down in late February to help slow the spread of infections.

Shanghai Disneyland will be the first Disney resort to reopen. It will do so May 11 with strict limits on capacity and requirements such as masks for employees and guests.

When Disney might reopen its domestic parks is a matter of great speculation. An analyst for J.P. Morgan predicted the parks could open as soon as June 1, but an analyst for Swiss banking giant UBS projected an opening for Jan. 1. Both analysts cautioned that attendance would probably lag below previous numbers for months. Disney has declined to comment on a reopening date for parks in Anaheim and Orlando, Fla.

The company’s film segment generated $466 million in operating income, down 8% year over year. Revenue was $2.54 billion, up 18%.

The theatrical run of Disney’s latest movie, Pixar’s “Onward,” was cut short because of cinema closures. It was quickly released on video-on-demand sites and, later, on Disney’s streaming service Disney+. Disney’s next release is “Mulan,” a live-action remake that was moved to a July 24 premiere after its original March 27 release was canceled. U.S. cinema chains are hoping to begin reopening in mid-June or early July. Films such as Marvel’s “Black Widow” and Pixar’s “Soul” have been delayed.

Disney’s TV segment — which includes ABC, ESPN and other networks — fared better. Operating income was $2.38 billion, up 7%, thanks to an increase in revenue from the inclusion of 21st Century Fox cable networks.

ESPN, which was already struggling from a loss of customers from cord-cutting, has been pummeled by the shutdown, losing much of its main draw: live sports.

However, the network currently has a ratings hit in “The Last Dance,” a 10-part documentary about former NBA star Michael Jordan’s career with the Chicago Bulls. The network’s “at home” coverage of the NFL draft was also a success.

Additionally, Disney+ has proved a popular refuge for sequestered families. The app, which launched in November with shows such as “The Mandalorian,” has hit 54.5 million global subscribers after launching in Western Europe and India.

Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international segment — composed of Disney+, Hulu and other units —continued to lose money as the company invested in growing its digital prowess to compete with Netflix and others.

The direct-to-consumer businesses lost $812 million, more than double the loss from the same quarter last year. Streaming and international revenue surged to $4.12 billion from $1.15 billion a year earlier.

Total revenue for Disney was $18 billion, up 21% from a year earlier largely because of the inclusion of sales from 21st Century Fox businesses. Analysts had estimated $17.8 billion in revenue.

The pre-pandemic staging of a baseball game in Dodger Stadium required “a symphony of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people,” in the words of Stan Kasten, the team’s president and chief executive officer.

If baseball returns this summer, that philharmonic convergence of players, coaches, executives, medical staff, media, clubhouse attendants, ushers, vendors, concessionaires, security guards, parking attendants, plumbers and electricians will be reduced to the stadium-employee equivalent of a string quartet.

Fans are expected to be excluded from the start of an abbreviated 2020 season, whether games are played in home parks with the league divided into three 10-team regional divisions (increasingly likely); games are played in Florida, Texas and Arizona (doubtful); or 30 teams begin play in the Phoenix area (highly unlikely).

Advertisement

That would eliminate the need for the bulk of the 1,800 or so spectator-related stadium employees Kasten and Angels team President John Carpino say are required for regular-season home games.

In an effort to reduce the exposure to and possible spread of the coronavirus, Major League Baseball is expected to limit stadium access to “essential personnel.” But who would be considered essential, and who would not?

The list is likely longer than expected at first glance.

“It becomes a math model — the more people you have, the greater risk of someone either having the virus or spreading the virus,” Carpino said. “I’ve been looking at how we could do this without fans, and you keep thinking, ‘We don’t need anybody.’

“Then you’re like, what about security? Oh yeah. What about cooks in the clubhouse dining room? Oh yeah. What about a statistician? Oh yeah. What about a video guy? Oh yeah. Before you know it, you have three dozen oh yeahs. I don’t know how to attack it, almost.”

Kasten said the Dodgers have been working on models for “essential” game crews, but with no plan or date for a startup firmly in place, clarity remains elusive.

“As soon as it came up, we started looking at it, and it’s just like with everything else — we still have more questions than answers,” Kasten said. “It’s going to depend on what guidance we are given from baseball, from the city and the state, on what restrictions will be imposed for us to play a game without fans.”

MLB officials have been in constant contact with teams, the players association and medical experts as they formulate a path forward, but the league is “not ready to go in-depth on this topic at this time,” a spokesman said this week.

“I’m relying on direction from MLB, it’s something they’re talking about nonstop, seven days a week,” Angels general manager Billy Eppler said. “They’re asking clubs for feedback, they’re crowd-sourcing a lot of these questions, and they’ll come up with the infrastructure that puts the health and safety of the players and people around them at the forefront of every decision.”

Kasten and Carpino said they expect MLB to issue a consistent set of guidelines to teams with limits on the number and types of uniformed and non-uniformed personnel allowed in the stadium.

Both executives estimated an “essential” group would require at least 100 people, consisting of 30-35 players, a manager, 11-12 coaches, a medical staff of 10-12 — including physicians, athletic trainers and strength-and-conditioning coaches — an equipment manager, four or five clubhouse attendants, two video-room coordinators, a traveling secretary and a handful of front-office executives.

“Will there be limitations on [clubhouse attendants]? Do both teams have the same number of trainers, doctors and X-ray technicians, or will the home team provide them?” Kasten said. “Are we supposed to operate the scoreboards? Do we need a public address announcer?

“Then there’s the whole world of the media. Are there restrictions on the numbers allowed in a stadium? Do we have pool reporting? How do we [keep reporters] separate? Are there personal interviews or is everything piped into the press box? I don’t know. Oh, we’ve got questions, man, lots of questions.”

One approach would be to have a bubble within the bubble — limiting access to the field and clubhouse to one group while allowing others access to the stadium only.

Advertisement

The former group would include those mentioned above, as well the four umpires, an MLB video-room monitor, two or three drug-testers on days tests are administered, a clubhouse security guard, six to 12 grounds-crew members, a handful of kitchen employees and a cleaning crew.

The latter group could include broadcasters, television and radio crew members, writers, an official scorekeeper, P.A. announcer, scoreboard and video board operators, media relations officials, baseball equipment distributors, facility maintenance crews of plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and mechanics and — at least, in the case of Dodger Stadium — organist Dieter Ruehle.

“Even right now, with the stadium closed, we have at least six people there every day,” Carpino said. “And we still have security on site.”

Advertisement

If MLB imposes strict limits on stadium access, it could have TV and radio announcers broadcast games from off-site studios and writers cover games off TV with post-game interviews conducted via video chat.

One area no one wants to scrimp on is medical staffing.

“You have the skill-development side, which is your on-field coaching group, and the medical side, which is your physical therapists, athletic trainers, chiropractor, massage therapist,” Eppler said. “By and large, in all these models, we’re still talking about playing a physical game that requires a certain standard of care, and you don’t want to take that away from your athletes.”

Another issue MLB must address: If there is no minor league season, teams will have to carry taxi squads of at least 15-20 players who will need coaching, medical care, athletic training and games — with umpires — to stay sharp.

Will they work out and play in home stadiums, greatly increasing the number of people in the bubble, or at another facility?

“It’s a lot of moving parts,” Carpino said, “but I feel like MLB is definitely on it and looking at everything, and we’re looking at them to give everybody direction.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-05-05/mlb-personnel-empty-stadiums-dodgers-stan-kasten-angels-john-carpino

As government officials evaluate the medical and societal impacts of reopening parts of the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Major League Baseball must decide whether bringing its sport back and televising it to homebound fans is a worthwhile risk.

Support is mounting for MLB to spearhead the return to pseudo-normality. Some believe games could start by late June and that the abbreviated season could feature 100 games. Getting to that point would require some finesse.

It seems the only safe way to stage baseball this year would be with no fans in attendance. Any model likely would not include the minor leagues, would expand MLB rosters from their current 26 players and would require a taxi squad of reserves in case of injury. Virus testing would be necessary for anyone expected to enter a stadium. And players would require at least three weeks of spring training to prepare for the abbreviated season.

With that in mind, let’s look at three spectator-free proposals MLB is reportedly considering: a realignment that would allow teams to operate in their respective cities, an enclosed 30-team operation in Arizona, and a three-state hub.

Play and practice at home

Mike Trout and Clayton Kershaw objected to separating from their loved ones for prolonged stretches. So remaining in the Los Angeles area for another round of spring training and playing the regular season in familiar settings, while following local virus-combating procedures, would be palatable to them.

Advertisement

The basics of the plan, as reported by USA Today :

Players would have access to most of the spoils of a regular season — MLB stadiums, familiar surroundings and charter flights, among other things — without sacrificing proximity to family.

Teams would play only within three geographically friendly divisions during the regular season, which would limit travel to one region of the country. The format would change in the postseason.

The number of people admitted into baseball’s work environments would be limited (likely to team officials and personnel, umpires and other game officials, broadcast crew and stadium staff), and all would be screened regularly for COVID-19 symptoms.

The wide-reaching system could be risky because players would return to their families after home games and their movements likely wouldn’t be closely monitored.

Behind-the-scenes dealings with government officials could also complicate matters. The 30 teams play in 28 cities. So not only would MLB have to contend with the policies of 17 states, Washington, D.C., and Toronto, it would also have to coordinate with the governments of 27 counties, the District of Columbia and the province of Ontario as well as respective city ordinances.

Exceptions would have to be made. In California, home to an MLB-leading five teams, sporting events without live audiences are not expected to be held until the third stage of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s four-phase plan for modifying stay-at-home orders is reached. That might not occur until August or September . But the governor indicated when he eased restrictions Monday that decision-making will be expanded to the local level.

Support might not be hard to come by. President Trump, Govs. Greg Abbott (Texas), Andrew Cuomo (New York) and Tom Wolf (Pennsylvania), and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot have encouraged baseball’s return this year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred last week, “America needs baseball.”

One feature of this plan would be especially sweet for Dodgers fans: The West division could pit the Dodgers against the Angels, San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners … and the Houston Astros, found guilty by MLB of cheating in their run-up to defeating the Dodgers in the 2017 World Series.

Send everyone to Arizona

Advertisement

The least risky plan would require all 30 teams to relocate to Arizona . It would also require the most restrictions and probably cause the most dissension among players.

Players, team personnel and others essential to baseball’s operation (such as umpires and broadcasters) would be isolated in hotels. They would travel only to Chase Field, the 10 spring training ballparks in the Phoenix area, and other local ballparks. There would be no room within what’s been termed as the “bubble” for anyone who refuses to follow the strict protocol. Departure from the bubble to attend to a family situation, such as the birth of a child, could require a two-week quarantine upon return.

The plan has raised concern that the frequent testing and protective equipment required for those within the bubble would jeopardize what is available to medical facilities and first responders as well as the general public.

Temperatures routinely over 100 degrees are also cause for concern, or at least discomfort.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is receptive to the single-state proposal. So is Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation’s top infectious disease expert.

MLB has considered whether to include the families of players. Doing so would greatly increase the demands for food, supplies and testing, but it might be the only way to persuade some players to participate.

Host teams in Arizona, Texas and Florida

Advertisement

There are two covered MLB stadiums in both Texas and Florida and one in Arizona, as well as multiple spring training and minor league ballparks across all three states. That infrastructure would be utilized in MLB’s three-state plan, which would place teams in hubs.

It is unknown how MLB would place the teams in the states or how it would operate within that setting.

One possibility would be to cluster teams around the two covered stadiums in both Florida and Texas, where the weather is less predictable than in Arizona, and take advantage of the controlled settings there to host doubleheaders on a regular basis.

However, that strategy would likely require an unbalanced approach, such as placing six to eight teams in Texas, 12 to 14 in Florida, and the rest in Arizona.

Two of the country’s quickest-to-reopen states — Texas and Florida — are included in this three-state proposal. So are two states that have tested the fewest number of people: Texas and Arizona, according to the COVID Tracking Project .

Although data could improve by a possible restart date in July, MLB would have to consider safeguards if it decides to place multiple teams in areas where the spread of the novel coronavirus is not fully understood.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-05-05/mlb-season-startup-pros-and-cons-of-three-scenarios

This is the downtime for creative minds to give baseball an imaginative makeover.

When the major leagues play again, they almost certainly will do so without fans. Do not fret over what you might fear as the joyless spectacle of tens of thousands of empty seats.

Instead, think of it this way: Baseball will be played in a giant television studio.

TV executives could lead the way in reinventing baseball as entertainment, building a bigger audience and inspiring dramatic changes that could outlast the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Even if none of this had happened, you can look at the ratings of baseball and see they are starting to trend downward,” ABC senior vice president Rob Mills said.

“It needs to be freshened up. If we were looking at this as a TV show, we’d say, ‘What can we do to refresh it, to look at it from an entertainment standpoint rather than a sports standpoint?’ ”

And now … it’s showtime! Let us know what you think of these ideas, and suggest your own.

MIKE FLEISS is the creator and producer of “The Bachelor.” He also is a big fan of the Chargers, and of sharing with every viewer the experience of standing on the playing field.

“If there’s no crowd noise, you’ll be able to hear all the trash-talking. You might as well embrace it. Start mic’ing up players, or use directional microphones, so you can hear everything that’s being said. That’s something the audience hasn’t had before. Having been on the field at games, hearing it is really exciting. That’s the thing I think would be the best.

“I would be trying to replace the excitement of the fans screaming and the pulsating cheering with the inside scoop of what it’s really like to be in the game and hear everything that’s being said, and even the stuff on the mound.”

Maybe not everything, at least not in real time. A brief delay would allow producers to select the most compelling dialogue, mute objectionable language, and protect the integrity of the game, particularly because one of the 30 teams has been proven to be a brazen cheater.

“Obviously, in light of the Astros stuff, you’d probably embargo television access for the teams playing, if you didn’t want them to hear discussions between pitchers and catchers.”

Fleiss is aware that some players, including the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw and Angels’ Mike Trout, have objected to the possibility of a bubble environment, in which they would be isolated from their families. For argument’s sake, let’s leave aside the issue of children and focus on players not seeing their wives or girlfriends, perhaps for months.

“The biggest problem with why sports leagues will never do it is that I don’t think the players will be able to maintain quarantine. These guys are never going to be able to go cold turkey. You’ve got to be able to embrace that truth and make that part of the game.”

Remember, Fleiss is the guy who dreamed up “The Bachelor.”

“What you do is, each game, you load up the stadium with their wives, at a distance from them and at a distance from each other, so there is no quarantine violation. The winning team gets to have their wives tested, and then essentially a conjugal visit.

Advertisement

“You can [film] all the girls. They’re beautiful. They’re in the stands, separated in their own sections or whatever. Those guys are now playing for more than the pride of winning a baseball game. If you go on an eight-game losing streak, that’s not good.”

And the rose

The offering of the rose is a signature element of “The Bachelor.” How about incorporating it into baseball — say, a manager gets a wild card to use any one batter at any one point in the game?

For instance, if the Angels had the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, with the score tied and Jason Castro due up, manager Joe Maddon could play his wild card by handing a rose to Trout so he would bat instead.

So, Fleiss, how about a rose for baseball?

“Reinstate Pete Rose. The final rose, man. There it is.”

SCOTT KAUFER is a television writer and producer. He was an executive producer of “Boston Legal,” a supervising producer of the sports-agent comedy “Arliss,” and a vice president at Warner Bros. Television.

Kaufer believes baseball could excite fans interested in being the only spectator at the ballpark. He proposes that, for each game, the home team would set up a contest or sweepstakes to select a designated fan.

“The home team would pick up, in a virus-safe way, in a hermetically sealed stretch limo or whatever they want, a fan chosen well in advance. He could sit wherever he wanted: luxury box, stadium club, owner’s box, front row, press box, anywhere he wants. He could move.”

One concession stand would be fully stocked, and the fan could come by and grab food or drink whenever he or she wished. The fan would be announced on the public address system, throw out the first pitch, and be listed in the box score: Attendance—1 (Grace Cohen).

The fan would be encouraged — but not forced — to sing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.”

“Baseball purists probably will hope, as I earnestly do, that each day’s designated fan will cowboy up and attempt the song solo. And I know what you’re thinking — the lyrics would need a bit of a tweak. So I would respectfully suggest:

“Take me out to the ballgame,

“Take me out — I’m the crowd!

“Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,

“But they’re free as a matter of fact. ...”

Give the manager two lifelines

Perhaps the fans could help managers make the right on-field decision in games. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)

Baseball marketing folks can hardly finish a sentence without using the words “fan engagement.” For Kaufer, the gold standard of audience engagement shows is “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.”

So, with fans limited to watching from home, let them play along. During a game, each manager would use two of the trademark “Millionaire” lifelines: phone a fan or poll the fans.

When the Dodgers are faced with deciding whether to keep Kershaw in the game or bring in Kenley Jansen, manager Dave Roberts could use one of the lifelines.

Advertisement

“The manager would turn to the camera and say, ‘I’m going to phone a fan’ or ‘I’m going to poll the fans,’ ” Kaufer said.

“If we can tolerate a delay for instant replay, this will be a much shorter delay. You’ll have the manager mic’d so we hear the ringing in the background, the fan being called: ‘Hello, this is Dave Roberts. What do you think?’”

Teams could run contests to designate the fan on the receiving end of the phone-a-fan question each day, and every viewer wanting to participate in a poll could do so instantly on an app.

Advertisement

Fans would have the satisfaction of saying they told the manager just what to do, no matter how it plays out.

“He’s not required to take the advice, just as contestants on ‘Millionaire’ are not required to take the advice,” Kaufer said, “but he is required to make the call.”

For all the tweaks baseball has made toward a faster game — limiting mound visits, shaving seconds off commercial breaks, eliminating the four throws in an intentional walk — the average time of game last season was a record high: 3 hours 5 minutes 35 seconds. Mills has seen enough.

“It’s so long,” he said. “If you look at it like a TV show, from an entertainment standpoint, you’d have a timing sheet: Here’s your format, and it’s got to be done in this amount of time.”

Try something radical: The game is over after three hours, period. Better yet: The game is shortened to seven innings, but no matter what, it’s over after two hours. If Shohei Ohtani is on the bench, and the Angels are saving him for a pinch-hit appearance, Maddon wouldn’t want to risk time running out without using him.

“That’s where it gets really interesting. You’re going to manage the game totally different,” Mills said.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has said he would consider extra-inning tiebreakers in the regular season but not in the postseason. Same thing here. Enforce the rule that requires staying in the batter’s box, put in a pitch clock, and thwart stall tactics. Eliminate mound visits, change pitchers from the dugout and eliminate warmup pitches — that’s what the bullpen is for.

“It’s like you were playing speed golf, except this is speed baseball,” Mills said.

Go young. Go TikTok

Even a two-hour game might be too long to capture the attention of youngsters and turn them into fans.

“Obviously, the thing we deal with in TV is short attention span,” Mills said.

Players will make TikToks, the bite-sized videos kids crave. Players will become more likable as they show off their personalities, goofing off with one another, in the clubhouse or between innings.

Better yet, sponsor a contest in which kids can direct players, virtually, in a TikTok video.

“Have kids choreograph something and get it on there. That’s going to give them a vested interest,” Mills said. “Kids could say, ‘I made this dance, and you’re all going to do it in the clubhouse.’ People would love to see that.”

Officer Ismael Tamayo, 44, a 13-year veteran of the LAPD, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in connection with the late-night shooting at the Stoddard Wells Off-Highway Vehicle Area that wounded a colleague.

But the San Bernardino County district attorney’s office on Tuesday filed a lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon against Tamayo, an Ontario resident. The filing identified the victim as Mark Mascareno, 48, a fellow officer in the LAPD’s Newton Division.

According to the D.A.'s charges, Tamayo used a a Glock .40-caliber handgun in the commission of a “serious and violent felony” that resulted in great bodily injury.

Multiple law enforcement sources who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the incident said three officers were camping, shooting their weapons and drinking alcohol in the hours before Mascareno was wounded.

San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies responded to a shooting call about 1 a.m. Sunday and found Mascareno with a gunshot wound to his shoulder. He was airlifted to a hospital.

Tamayo was found nearby in possession of a firearm and taken into custody, authorities said.

The LAPD has initiated an administrative investigation.

Chief Michel Moore told the L.A. Police Commission on Tuesday he was thankful that the wounded officer was out of the hospital.

“I am very disappointed and frustrated by this event,” Moore said, noting that the injury was “serious and life-threatening.”

In addition how the shooting occurred, Moore said he wants to know why the officers were at the campground during the state’s stay-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic. The area appeared to be open to the public, and other campers were nearby, according to a preliminary investigation.

“What led up to this shooting is very important,” the chief said. “I’d like to not just understand the criminality, but what other issues I might have as chief as to how they ended up there to begin with.”

Tamayo’s attorney, Gregory G. Yacoubian, said in an email his client is cooperating with authorities.

“We are confident that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing once the facts are made known. We ask that due process be allowed to run its course and that the privacy of Ismael and his family is respected,” Yacoubian said.

“It is important that you know that Ismael Tamayo served honorably for over 21 years with the United States military, which included several deployments overseas, and is presently a tenured Los Angeles Police Officer.”

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05,Judge restores New York Democratic presidential primary on June 23,"The New York Democratic presidential primary must take place June 23 because canceling it would be unconstitutional, a judge ruled Tuesday.

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan ruled after hearing arguments a day earlier as lawyers for withdrawn presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang argued that it was wrong to cancel the primary.

The judge said there was enough time before the primary occurs to figure out how to carry it out safely.

“If all but one of the presidential candidates are removed from the ballot and the primary is not held, Delegate Plaintiffs will be deprived of the opportunity to compete for delegate slots and shape the course of events at the Convention, and voters will lose the chance to express their support for delegates who share their views, the judge wrote. “The loss of these First Amendment rights is a heavy hardship.”

She added: “There is also a strong public interest in permitting the presidential primary to proceed with the full roster of qualified candidates.”

The Democratic members of the State’s Board of Elections voted to cancel the primary even though New York was still planning to hold its congressional and state-level primaries June 23.

They cited the danger to voters from the coronavirus as a reason to cancel the election since former Vice President Joe Biden has been endorsed by the major candidates he had faced.

New York state Democratic party chair Jay Jacobs said: “We are reviewing it.”

Jacobs had called holding the primary “unnecessary” with the suspension of Sanders’ campaign and said reduced turnout could reduce the need for as many poll workers.

About 1,900 Airbnb employees worldwide will be affected, Chief Executive Brian Chesky wrote in an email to staff Tuesday. Those employees’ last day will be Monday, the email said.

“We are collectively living through the most harrowing crisis of our lifetime, and as it began to unfold, global travel came to a standstill,” Chesky wrote. “Airbnb’s business has been hit hard, with revenue this year forecasted to be less than half of what we earned in 2019.”

The San Francisco startup, which was poised to be the blockbuster stock listing of the year, has raised $2 billion in capital and dramatically cut costs in a bid to weather the slump.

“While we know Airbnb’s business will fully recover, the changes it will undergo are not temporary or short-lived,” Chesky wrote. “Because of this, we need to make more fundamental changes to Airbnb by reducing the size of our workforce around a more focused business strategy.”

As a result, Airbnb will pause its efforts in transportation and scale back its investments in hotels and luxury travel, he said.

In an interview with Bloomberg in March, Chesky said the situation has weighed on him. “I’m not sure if there’s a more difficult thing that a CEO of a travel company could ever do than go through this,” he said. “You feel like you were T-boned, or like a torpedo has just hit the ship.”

Before the pandemic, Airbnb’s expenses had already been growing. In 2019, expenses exceeded $5 billion as the company sank money into new offerings aimed at increasing revenue before its highly anticipated initial public offering. The coronavirus outbreak has put Airbnb’s market debut in jeopardy.

Chesky is betting that in the post-pandemic world, travelers will want options that are closer to home, safer and more affordable.

“When we started Airbnb, it was about belonging and connection,” he wrote in the email. “This crisis has sharpened our focus to get ​back to our roots, back to the basics.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-05/airbnb-layoffs-cutting-25-of-staff-travel-slump

Elon Musk just revealed on Twitter the futuristic name and first photos of his new baby boy with Canadian musician Grimes. She gave birth on Monday, and the SpaceX chief executive said that “Mom & baby all good.”

In one tweet, Musk, who’s known for his prolific and sometimes inflammatory opinions on social media, presented a heavily edited image of the newborn, swaddled in cloth, fast asleep and covered in face tattoos. A snake illustration and the word “SAVAGE” were among X Æ A-12’s Instagram-filtered body art. (No, we don’t know how to pronounce the baby’s name either.)

“Never too young for some ink haha,” the Tesla mastermind joked in the replies.

A more traditional photo featured Musk, 48, in an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt cradling the tiny human in one arm while holding a medical mask in the opposite hand.

Earlier this year, Grimes, 32, casually announced on Instagram that she was seven months pregnant while unveiling her new digital avatar, WarNymph, and album “Miss Anthropocene.” Grimes later confirmed Musk was the father in a Rolling Stone profile.

The two have been romantically linked since they walked the “heavenly bodies”-themed carpet together at the 2018 Met Gala.

Grimes’ pregnancy news had spurred a flurry of speculation on social media as to what the experimental pop artist and her tech mogul boyfriend would name their child.

In a sprawling February cover interview with the Face magazine, Grimes admitted that some of the snarky suggestions — including obscure computer codes and “ERROR404"" alerts — were “on point.”

At the time, the performer explained the decision to create a virtual stand-in for herself so that she could be in two places at once as a working, expectant mother.

“Having a digital body allows me to keep working throughout the later stages of my pregnancy, and after I have my baby, so I can spend more time with them,” Grimes said. “It’s hard for me to do photo shoots and fit into clothes at the moment, but WarNymph is here in your magazine promoting my album for me ... A lot of my friends aren’t having babies because they’re worried about their careers, and we wanted to find a way to overcome this issue.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-05-05/elon-musk-grimes-baby-photos-name-twitter

It will air simultaneously across all the major networks and social media platforms.

The idea for an Obama commencement speech first gained traction three weeks ago, when Eagle Rock High School senior Lincoln Debenham, 17, took to Twitter to petition the former president.

“Like most high school/college seniors, I’m saddened by the loss of milestone events, prom & graduation. In an unprecedented time, it would give us great comfort to hear your voice,” he tweeted at Barack Obama, to the tune of 225,000 likes and more than 46,000 retweets.

Lincoln, who will study political science at Cal State L.A. in the fall, does not know if the Obamas’ decision to hold commencement events is directly tied to his original request. After his tweet went viral, CNN reported that the Obamas’ spokeswoman said the couple was aware of it and “very flattered.”

Lincoln awoke to an exciting surprise when his mother, Caissie St. Onge, burst into his bedroom at 9:30 Tuesday morning, waving her cellphone with the news.

“I’m just gonna enjoy it really, because I think it’s much-needed and it’s a really good gift that you don’t get every day,” he said of the May 16 event.

"['Staff Writer', 'Randall Roberts Is A Staff Writer Covering Music', 'Pens The Weekly California Sounds Column For The Los Angeles Times.']",2020-05-05,"Historic Troubadour nightclub launches GoFundMe page, calls survival ‘a big if’","For 60 years, the historic club the Troubadour has anchored the western edge of West Hollywood with live music. A perennial presence in Los Angeles live music since the beatnik era, the club opened by Doug Weston has provided thousands of artists the opportunity to make magic on hallowed ground.

But as Gov. Gavin Newsom was recently laying out the stages by which businesses may be able to re-open, Christine Karayan, the club’s general manager, realized the seeming futility of the Troubadour’s plight. Newsom has announced that music venues will be among the last to open, in Phase 4.

“That means the middle to the end of next year to potentially open, and maybe a 25% cap” on crowd size, Karayan says. “I can’t foresee being able to ride this out like that.”

A rustic general admission room with a small balcony and an upstairs VIP area, the 500-capacity club’s selling point has long been its intimacy. Save a few pesky support beams, there’s not a bad spot in the place. A folk and blues venue to start, in the mid-1960s it started adding rock, jazz and pop acts that included rising artists such as the Byrds, Lee Hazlewood, Nina Simone and Judy Collins. It served as a crucial early comedy platform for Richard Pryor, Steve Martin and the Smothers Brothers.

Though it’s a tourist destination, its location just south of the Sunset Strip has made it a kind of neighborhood spot for musically minded Hollywood Hills, Beverly Hills and Hollywood residents.

Starting in the late ‘60s, the Troubadour helped guide artists including Joni Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Tom Waits, the Eagles and Warren Zevon into the mainstream. Most famously, it was on the Troubadour’s stage in 1970 that a 20-year-old Elton John, across a series of shows, became a household name. That moment was captured in the recent John biopic, “Rocketman.”

“My whole life came alive that night, musically, emotionally... everything,” Elton John told The Times a few decades after those auspicious performances. “It was like everything I had been waiting for suddenly happened.... I could tell it was a magical night from the moment I stepped onstage.”

In the decades since, the Troubadour has remained defiantly independent. As other clubs shuttered or made booking arrangements with moneyed promoters such as Live Nation and AEG, the Troubadour has charted its own course — and continued booking standing-room-only gigs. “My last four talent buyers, actually, have all gone to Live Nation,” Karayan says with a fatalistic chuckle. “I’m the training ground, apparently.”

Advertisement

Outsiders commonly think of the Troubadour as a folk and singer-songwriter venue, but across the decades it has adapted and evolved. In the ‘80s, as heavy metal ripped through Southern California, the Troubadour served as a stage for early gigs by Slayer, Metallica and Motley Crue. In the 1990s and ‘00s, the club hosted Brit pop, grunge and alt-rock: Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, Melvins, Dave Matthews, the White Stripes, Bon Iver and Weezer all played beneath the club’s iconic neon sign on their ascents to main stages.

The Troubadour brand in Los Angeles is so embedded into music culture that many fans misunderstand the mechanics of the club, Karayan says. Describing it as “a little bit forgotten,” Karayan says, “We’re lumped in with the big boys, and we’re not the big boys. We don’t have shareholders. We don’t have corporate money. We are what we are.”

Karayan’s father, Ed Karayan, owns both the club and the building that it’s housed in. He’s been sole caretaker since his former business partner Weston died in 1999. The club leases neighboring offices and storage space at market value, and insurance premiums are exorbitant.

Listing the costs, Karayan pauses. “The more I think about it, it’s just completely futile. At least a big seated venue has space where they can keep people apart. But I don’t know how that works for a general admission venue. Are you going to stop them from using the restroom?”

Like most proprietors, at first Karayan figured that the pandemic would prompt some temporary belt-tightening. She remembers her mind set: “At first, it was, ‘What is happening?’ And then we started canceling shows.”

The last gig was Glass Animals on March 11. YouTube videos show the band’s singer, Dave Bayley, singing from up in the balcony before moving his way through the VIP area and back onto stage. The place was packed. The next day, doom set in, Karayan says. “When we walked into the office on March 12, I thought, ‘Something horribly wrong is coming our way.’” So she decided to cancel shows through May. “And then it just started unraveling.”

When she read a month ago that Live Nation and AEG were predicting a fall 2020 reopening, Karayan was relieved. “I was like, ‘We can do that. We probably won’t have concerts until the end of the year, but it’s OK.” But, she adds, “Now it’s like, ‘Oh, I’m sorry. We’re talking, potentially, the middle of next year.’”

As an active member of the National Independent Venue Assn., she’s communicating with its 800 affiliates about lobbying for government aid. She says that many have expressed doubt that they’ll be able to survive an extended closure without immediate help.

Like many businesses, the Troubadour set up a GoFundMe page to help its 20 hourly employees, some of whom have worked at the club for decades, meet their needs. All but three have been laid off. To date, the campaign has raised $11,400 of its $30,000 goal. But that was a stopgap measure, and Karayan said the club will soon be raising its goal to underscore the urgency. It’s one of the only remaining options.

“It looks tacky, but it’s a reality at this point. It’s not a joke,” she says. “If we’re going to survive this thing — and that’s a big if — we’re going to need all the help we can get, from any direction we can get it.”

Whether that aid comes from one of the many multi-millionaires who owe their fortunes, in part, to momentous gigs at the Troubadour, or through the thousands of fans with once-in-a-lifetime memories, response to the Troubadour’s ask will likely determine whether that Glass Animals gig was the last show at the club.

“We know there’s going to be a huge fatality rate as far as how many venues will not be able to open again when/if this thing ever ends,” Karayan has concluded. “We’re just looking to survive, like everybody else.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-05-05/troubadour-nightclub-west-hollywood-elton-john-coronavirus

About a week after Chris Cuomo announced he finally tested negative for COVID-19, his 14-year-old son, Mario, has also recovered from the respiratory illness, according to an Instagram update from the CNN anchor’s wife, Cristina Cuomo.

“All you need is [love],” the wellness blogger posted Tuesday along with a photo of her kids. “Mario healed, Bella + Carolina stayed safe and I am so grateful for the the silver lining—more family time, to have antibodies and be able to donate.”

Last month, Chris Cuomo said on his CNN show, “Prime Time,” that Mario was the third in their family to contract the virus after both he and Cristina Cuomo had already fallen ill. The newscaster became the first in his household to test positive in late March.

Times film critic Justin Chang sat down with entertainment columnist Glenn Whipp to discuss the dominant performance of the 2012 Disney/Marvel blockbuster and where it fits amid the overall glut of superhero movies.

Remember to tune in to their conversation 6 p.m. Thursday livestreamed on the L.A. Times Classic Hollywood Facebook Page and YouTube as well as Twitter. Be sure to watch (or rewatch) “The Avengers” in advance. It is available to stream on Prime Video, Disney+ and most VOD platforms.

And please vote in this week’s poll on Twitter (@justincchang) to select next week’s movie.

JUSTIN CHANG: There’s a scene in “The Avengers” in which Loki, the power-mad Asgardian villain played by Tom Hiddleston, sneers at a crowd of kneeling people and declares, “You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.” I’m hardly the first one to watch that scene and think about how Loki’s words might apply to the intensity and seeming ubiquity of Disney/Marvel fandom. More than most Hollywood blockbusters, “The Avengers” and its 22 siblings in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were made in a spirit of all-out conquest. They were built for worldwide domination, and they’ve succeeded to a degree that can be awe-inspiring, and more than a little depressing, to think about.

I thought about Loki’s words again as I watched “The Avengers” close in on victory in the first week of our #UltimateSummerMovie Showdown. Glenn, I know you can relate: How cool would it have been if another picture from our designated May 1-7 release window — like the sharp political comedy “Dave” or the glorious “Much Ado About Nothing,” both of which opened in theaters May 7, 1993 — had come out on top instead? Or, if we had to have a comic-book superhero movie, couldn’t it have been Sam Raimi’s ebullient “Spider-Man” (2002), which went head-to-masked-head with “The Avengers” in the final round and briefly looked as though it might prevail?

It wasn’t to be. “The Avengers” is our winner, and it is the winner I expected when I finalized the 16 movies set to compete last week. This was always going to be Marvel’s week; the MCU loves releasing movies in early May, and our Twitter polls showed a lot of voter support for franchise favorites “Iron Man” (2008) and “Captain America: Civil War” (2016). It was only fitting that they’d be swallowed up in the end by “The Avengers,” the movie that brought those beloved superhero characters and others together for the first time.

And it is not, I should add, an unworthy winner — although The Times readers who voted it the most overrated film of 2012 in an online survey might beg to differ. I certainly enjoyed “The Avengers” the first time I saw it. After the bland likes of “Thor” and “Captain America: The First Avenger,” it really did feel like an inspired synthesis, a clean-burning entertainment engine that I described in my Variety review as “buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining” and “a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts.” I pretty much stand by those assertions, though not unreservedly. Watching Joss Whedon’s movie again, eight years and 17 MCU movies later, it’s hard not to see it through the prism of superhero fatigue or to wish that its smooth, machine-tooled professionalism had a more human touch. I can tip my hat to the achievement, to be sure, but kneeling is out of the question.

GLENN WHIPP: You mention “superhero fatigue,” Justin, and at the risk of inspiring HULK SMASH collective rage from MCU zealots here, I should admit by the time “Avengers: Infinity War” rolled out, I was watching these films on the back of airplane seats. I do not wear this as a badge of honor, just an honest admission that toward the end of watching the 23 Marvel movies that comprise what’s known as “The Infinity Saga,” along with Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, plus those (mostly horrible) DC Comics movies (“Wonder Woman” excepted), the “X-Men” series and so on and so forth, the thrill was gone, baby.

If the Marvel movies are, as Martin Scorsese observed, more akin to theme parks than cinema, then I was starting to feel like I was coming to the end of an all-day visit to Disneyland in the middle of July and, in my exhausted mind, the Happiest Place on Earth is the tram returning me to the parking structure.

But it’s been a year since I’ve seen a Marvel movie. And … I … kind … of … miss … them? Not Hawkeye. Not adolescent Groot. But I was looking forward to seeing Chloé Zhao’s vision for “The Eternals” and the long-awaited “Black Widow” standalone movie, directed by Cate Shortland. The best way to combat our collective exhaustion with superhero movies is to hire interesting directors. Props to Marvel for doing just that.

Rewatching “The Avengers” over the weekend, I tried to use one of those Neuralyzers from “Men in Black” — I’m probably tearing a hole in the fabric of the cosmos by crossing cinematic universes here — and erase my memories of those subsequent 17 Marvel movies and just focus on “The Avengers” and the prior entries. And don’t come at me and say if I used a Neuralyzer I wouldn’t remember anything. That’s like saying the Hulk cannot be both a raging, uncontrollable monster and a rational, focused team player when, as we see (quite improbably) in “The Avengers,” he can be both when it suits the storytelling.

What I appreciate most about “The Avengers” is that smooth way it checks off all the boxes, seamlessly integrating multiple characters, giving most of them something interesting to do and delivering a fun spectacle you can take seriously — or not — depending on your reverence for the material. It’s easy now to take that competence for granted. However, you need only look at the graveyard of failed blockbusters (“Battleship” was supposed to be that summer’s other big hit) to understand how this movie could have easily crashed and burned. I’m never bending the knee. But I’m OK being subjugated for a couple of hours if I’m in good hands.

CHANG: I think you’ve nailed the point quite elegantly, Glenn, and also the problem. I suspect we feel more or less the same way about “The Avengers” and could probably argue either position depending on the day. I could easily take the more generous view of the movie’s undeniable virtues — the superb casting, the dexterity of the plotting, the adroit balance of humor, action and exposition — while you stubbornly pointed out some of the deficits, namely the fact that even the most expertly tooled and polished machine is still, at the end of the day, a machine. It’s true that it’s easy to take competence for granted. As the largely unquestioning Marvel-loving masses have made more than clear, it’s also very easy to settle for it.

I’m not saying I prefer “Battleship” (confession: I never saw “Battleship”). But I do think beneath the super-slick banter and the bloodless, oddly unmemorable action scenes, there is something soulless and even antiseptic about the Marvel enterprise. The silky smoothness of these movies is what you get after you’ve ironed out every last kink, every possible threat of darkness and eccentricity, anything that might reek of too much style or interfere with MCU brand imperatives. There have been welcome exceptions, of course: the trippy visuals of “Doctor Strange,” the goofy alien constituents of “Guardians of the Galaxy” and above all the genuine grandeur and political depth of “Black Panther.” But they are very much exceptions to an otherwise depressingly inflexible rule.

But enough grousing from me. It may be damning these movies with faint praise to say that most of them have been pretty good, but “The Avengers” is pretty good — and sometimes a bit better than that. The actors could hardly be better: Robert Downey Jr. may deserve a richer signature role than Tony Stark, but his sandpaper-dry wisecracks are never not enjoyable. The Chrises (Evans and Hemsworth) are first-rate too. If I can borrow your Neuralyzer, Glenn, it is fun to try and forget all the subsequent Sturm und Drang and just watch these guys meet up, hang out and kick each other around for the first time. Also, Hiddleston is just so deliciously smackable as Loki and the incredible moment when he gets his ass handed to him by the Hulk remains, for me, the movie’s endlessly replayable high point.

Speaking of Hulk: The gravity of Mark Ruffalo’s performance as Dr. Bruce Banner really lingered this time around. He’s always been one of this series’ underexposed bright spots; his sly, bookish diffidence is the perfect counterweight to his alter ego’s uncontrollable rage. It’s telling, I think, that the Hulk has been such a logistically problematic, hard-to-sustain figure in the Marvel cosmos, as evidenced by his two previous solo outings (in which he was played by Eric Bana and Edward Norton). Starting with Ruffalo in “The Avengers,” they not only got the right man but also figured out how to use him — with short, well-timed bursts of destructive mayhem and comic relief. I wish they’d use him more, frankly; a loss of control might have done this rigorously managed franchise some good.

WHIPP: It’s not entirely bloodless, Justin. Or have you forgotten those blood-stained Captain America trading cards that Nick Fury removed (not really) from the corpse of the dearly departed Agent Coulson? Or perhaps you did, as his death wasn’t quite the gut punch it should have been. Coulson was the moral compass of the whole operation. Plus, he had Loki pegged better than anybody. “You lack conviction,” Coulson tells him, shortly before getting off one last blast. Of course, death being a loose construct in the MCU, it’s not the last we’ll see of Coulson. I just hope the Avengers mourned him in the moment. He deserves a shawarma sandwich named in his honor.

At this point, 23 movies in, it would take something stronger than a Neuralyzer to erase what you astutely called “Marvel brand imperatives,” Justin. Proficient plotting can also be seen (and, more importantly, felt) as bland programming, leading to a series of films that often boast sparkling continuity at the expense of thrilling imagination.

But we didn’t know what was to come when “The Avengers” arrived eight years ago, so I still can appreciate its small touches of weirdness — Hiddleston’s “full-tilt diva” turn as Loki, the way Coulson gets all starstruck when he’s around Captain America, Pepper Potts padding around in her bare feet because A) smart women don’t need heels or B) Gwyneth Paltrow has a couple of inches on Downey and Iron Man cannot be seen being dwarfed by a member of the opposite sex.

Really though, any movie featuring the late Harry Dean Stanton is OK by me, even if he has a just a cameo and even if his casting, according to Whedon, was purely accidental as cinematographer Seamus McGarvey happened to be shooting a documentary about the actor. That happy accident does prove your point, though, Justin. Moments of invention can sometimes provide the most lasting joys.

The L. A. Times Ultimate Summer Movie Showdown When: 6 p.m. May 7

This week ‘Bridesmaids’ and 15 more compete,"Welcome to the second week of the L.A. Times #UltimateSummerMovie Showdown, our 16-week contest to program the greatest summer movie season ever. Or at least since 1975, the year that “Jaws” forever changed the landscape of moviemaking, gross tallying and beach bumming forever.

To recap the rules: Each week, I will present you with a list of 16 movies from 1975 to 2019, all of which were released during a particular summer time frame. Last week, the contenders included such May 1-7 releases as “Sixteen Candles” (1984), “Dave” (1993), “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery” (1997) and “Spider-Man” (2002).

The winner of that superhero-heavy bout — triumphing over fellow Marvel franchise installments “Iron Man” (2008) and “Captain America: Civil War” (2016) — was “The Avengers” (2012). At 6 p.m. Pacific on Thursday, my Times colleague Glenn Whipp and I will be co-hosting a live chat on “The Avengers” that will be streamed on the Los Angeles Times Classic Hollywood Facebook Page and YouTube as well as Twitter. The movie is available to watch in advance on Prime Video, Disney+ and most VOD platforms.

There are no Marvel movies in contention this week, which covers movies that opened in U.S. theaters between May 8-14 , 1975-2019. But there are some excellent movies, and even the also-rans commanded passionate support among The Times colleagues who helped me hash out the list. Here are the films, in chronological order:

Advertisement

“Friday the 13th” (1980)

It may have been a slipshod “Halloween” ripoff, but it was also ruthlessly effective enough to launch one of the most iconic (and endless) slasher franchises in movie history.

“Conan the Barbarian” (1982)

Two years before “Terminator,” John Milius’ sword-and-sorcery beefcake extravaganza propelled that Nietzschean super-warrior Arnold Schwarzenegger to global stardom.

“Blue Thunder” (1983)

Its politics may be as dated as its technology, but the thrill of Roy Scheider and Malcolm McDowell going head-to-head in helicopters never gets old.

“The Natural” (1984)

“Primordial hokum,” Pauline Kael called it. And like a lot of hokum, Barry Levinson’s lacquered ode to the majesty of baseball — and Robert Redford — is still hard to resist.

Advertisement

“Short Circuit” (1986)

After “Blue Thunder,” this runaway-robot comedy is the second John Badham-directed movie about government technology run amok on this week’s list. I haven’t seen it since childhood, but if it gets far enough in the voting, I’m curious to see how it holds up.

“The Crow” (1994)

Forever linked to the accidental death of its star, Brandon Lee, during filming, Alex Proyas’ comic-book adaptation endures as a work of feverish visual imagination.

“Crimson Tide” (1995)

Tony Scott’s submarine thriller pitting a cool Denzel Washington against a barking Gene Hackman arrives drenched in testosterone, warmed-over Cold War paranoia and the best faux clammy-Clancy atmosphere money can buy.

“Twister” (1996)

Helen Hunt and the late Bill Paxton starred in this gargantuan hit that put the “fun” in “funnel.” Be sure and catch its recently released spiritual prequel, “First Cow.”

Advertisement

“The Fifth Element” (1997)

It’s got a blond Bruce Willis. It’s got an orange-haired Milla Jovovich. It’s got flying cars, whizzing bullets and an engorged fireball of death. It’s got damn near everything you might want in a movie and a hell of a lot you don’t.

“Deep Impact” (1998)

Speaking of engorged fireballs of death: This is the first and more sensitively drawn of the two summer-of-1998 thrillers about an enormous chunk of matter on a collision course with Earth (the other being, of course, “Armageddon”). Téa Leoni and Maximilian Schell’s last scene still gets to me.

“Unfaithful” (2002)

Adrian Lyne’s steamy, moralistic potboiler is never as smart or emotionally sophisticated as Diane Lane’s blazingly good performance, but she made it something to see and sometimes swoon over.

“Speed Racer” (2008)

A critical and commercial disappointment for the Wachowskis on initial release, this riotous blur of color and kinetic energy has only grown in cult stature over the years.

Advertisement

“Star Trek” (2009)

Led by a superbly matched Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, it’s the rare movie to turn a financial imperative (a reboot!) into an ingenious narrative loophole. It also remains, by light years, the best “Star” movie of any kind that J.J. Abrams has directed.

“Bridesmaids” (2011)

It was explosively funny, yes. Thanks to star Kristen Wiig (who wrote the script with Annie Mumolo), it was also a perceptive, emotionally lacerating portrait of friendship, class envy and midlife disappointment.

“The Great Gatsby” (2013)

In Baz Luhrmann’s very busy hands, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic became a gaudy carnival of maximalist kitsch. Love it or hate it (and I’m right in the middle), Leonardo DiCaprio remains a Jay Gatsby for the ages.

“Neighbors” (2014)

Nicholas Stoller’s sharp, raucous comedy of intergenerational warfare has Seth Rogen and Zac Efron giving it their all, but Rose Byrne is its secret weapon. (Between this and “Bridesmaids,” it’s clearly her week.)

Advertisement

The also-rans: Among the May 8-14 releases that narrowly missed our list were “A Knight’s Tale” (2001), the medieval-goblet-of-rock fantasy starring Heath Ledger, and “28 Weeks Later” (2007), an underappreciated sequel to “28 Days Later” and a terrific pandemic movie to boot.

I did that thing that people talk about: I was watching [New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s] broadcast. I just picked up a bag and I threw a couple clothes in it. I drove to the airport, and I just bought a ticket. I mean, I had a mask and I had, like, all this hand sanitizer... I have days where it’s so incredible I get to spend this time with these people I really care about, and then I have days where I’m like, “I just want to go to a coffee shop, and I want someone to come over and hug me.” So it’s this weird mixture. I have great days and I have horrible days.

While production of Season 4 of “Stranger Things” is on hold for now, we caught up with Harbour to discuss what his character, gruff small-town police chief Jim Hopper, would do in quarantine; the lie he told Aaron Sorkin while working on “The Newsroom”; and connecting with the Duffer brothers to plan the future of Netflix’s sci-fi/horror hit.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.', 'Jill Lawless']",2020-05-04,Prince Harry and Meghan to tell ‘real’ story in new book,"Freed from the constraints of life as full-time royals — and enmeshed in a feud with Britain’s tabloid press — Prince Harry and his wife Meghan plan to tell their story in a book penned by sympathetic journalists.

Harper Collins U.K. announced Monday that it will publish “Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family” in Britain and the Commonwealth on Aug. 11. The book will be published in the U.S. the same day by HarperCollins-owned Dey Street Books.

The book is written by Harper’s Bazaar royal editor Omid Scobie and Elle magazine royal correspondent Carolyn Durand, who said they aim to capture “the real Harry and Meghan” and “finally present the truth of misreported stories” about them.

The publisher said the book will tackle “the many rumors and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond.” It says the authors have been given “unique access” and the cooperation of those closest to the couple.

The announcement comes two weeks after Harry and Meghan said they would no longer cooperate with several British tabloid newspapers because of what they called “distorted, false or invasive” stories.

Meghan is suing publisher Associated Newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over a series of articles in the Mail on Sunday that reproduced parts of a letter she wrote to her father, Thomas Markle.

Harry, who is a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and sixth in line to the British throne, married the American actress Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle in May 2018, in a lavish ceremony watched around the world.

The couple later said they found the scrutiny they received from the British media intolerable and claimed it tipped into harassment.

In January, they announced they planned to step back as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America. The split became official at the end of March, and the couple have relocated to the Los Angeles area, where Meghan was raised.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-04/new-book-aims-to-portray-real-prince-harry-and-meghan

"['Frank Shyong Is A Columnist For The Los Angeles Times Writing About Diversity', 'Diaspora In Los Angeles.']",2020-03-10,"On a new podcast about Asian American identity, we talk about the struggle to feel we’re ‘enough’","When I was 15 years old and growing up in Tennessee, some popular girls asked me to play the character Ching in my high school’s production of “Anything Goes,” a classic Broadway musical about the antics of passengers on a transatlantic ocean liner.

Ching, and his counterpart, Ling, are racial caricatures — two Chinese gamblers imprisoned for cheating passengers out of their money. I accepted the role because I was a geeky freshman flattered by the attention and eager to make friends.

And so for three nights and dozens of rehearsals, I donned a red silk robe, spoke in a feigned Chinese accent and portrayed my people as America has always seen them — as an untrustworthy, exotic punchline.

Advertisement

I feel a lot of shame about that memory, and I’ve never really talked about it. I was worried by what other Asian Americans might think of me, and most of the time I just try to forget that it even happened. I’ve covered Asian American communities for nearly a decade now, and I’ve tried to make my career as a journalist about the opposite of what I did on that stage.

But I’ve been talking about this memory a lot recently, and about a lot of others like it, because we’ve been working on a podcast at the Los Angeles Times called “Asian Enough,” to be released March 17.

Each week, entertainment reporter Jen Yamato and I interview a different guest about what being Asian American means to them. On every episode, we talk about what Asian Americans are, and aren’t. We name the boxes that America tries to put us in, and together, we encourage one another to reject them.

What we’ve found is that sharing these vulnerabilities can take away their power to hurt us. And talking about them has helped me understand that a lot of Asian Americans have been through a lot of the same things. Though we might be the most disparate racial category in America, comprising dozens of nationalities, languages and cultures, what we have in common are the weird stereotypes that America tries to apply to us.

Advertisement

I’ve come to see being Asian American as not so much an identity as it is a shared sense of racial dislocation. It’s what happens when this country tries to put you in a box. Sometimes you climb in because you crave belonging. Or you reject it, but it haunts you anyway. And sometimes you realize you don’t fit any of the boxes, and you’re left to wonder whether you fit in at all.

When you can’t be Asian enough and you’ll never be American enough to fit into any other racial category, what remains is this nagging feeling of alienation and inadequacy. And you start to blame yourself rather than the impossible quandaries you’re presented with.

So on our podcast, we also talk about our shames and flaws, and try to accept them. It’s a scary conversation to have, but an important one: Psychologists are exploring the possibility of a connection between racial dislocation and mental illness among Asian Americans. Asian Americans may be overrepresented at elite colleges, but once there, they struggle with higher rates of suicide and mental illness.

And so many of my Asian American friends have spoken of not being Asian enough and not being seen as American. If we all feel this way, maybe we’re having the wrong kind of conversation.

Growing up in Tennessee, I thought I could find belonging in trying to be white. I remember saving up my money to buy clothes from Abercrombie & Fitch and begging my mom for a puka shell necklace. I studied “Friends” episodes to try to understand American humor, and rehearsed the jokes, thinking that if I could be seen as a Joey, Chandler or Ross, perhaps I would be more popular or socially interesting.

But I never felt like myself. Playing Ching helped me realize that.

Moving to California, and spending the last 10 years telling Asian American stories, I’ve found so much belonging in my community. What once brought me shame now fills me with pride. I own my own silk jacket now that I bought in Chinatown, and I wear it when I visit the temple on Chinese New Year. When I’m out reporting, I no longer find it shameful to hear Asian-accented English — instead, it reminds me of my mother and father talking.

We may never figure out how to convince American society that we are just as American as everyone else. But we can try to accept each other. We can tell each other, even as society tells us the opposite, that who we are is enough.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-10/asian-enough-why
"['Editorial Writer', 'Scott Martelle', 'A Veteran Journalist', 'Author Of Six History Books', 'Primarily Writes About Immigration', 'Climate Change', 'Gun Policy', 'The Death Penalty.']",2020-05-05,Politics is why Trump is ending coronavirus task force early,"Vice President Mike Pence confirmed to reporters on Tuesday afternoon that the White House might look to close down the special coronavirus task force he’s been leading, possibly in early June.

Why, you might ask?

Well, there are a couple of explanations.

“It really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country,” Pence said. “The president stood up the White House coronavirus task force … to marshal a national response.”

Advertisement

“And as I’ve said before,” Pence continued, “as we continue to practice social distancing and states engage in safe and responsible reopening plans, I truly believe — and the trend lines support it — that we could be in a very different place” by late May or early June.

Fantastic. Except for those other reports that government predictions suggest 3,000 deaths per day by June, a 70% increase over the current daily tally, and a separate analysis suggesting the number of COVID-19 deaths nationwide could double to 135,000 by August. That comes as states — including California — begin loosening restrictions.

Then there’s the political explanation.

Advertisement

By closing down the task force, the White House would shift the visible responsibility for the fight against the coronavirus from the president to federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (led by Dr. Anthony Fauci) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as to state governments and elected officials.

Doing so would position Trump to head into the summer — and the early scale-up of the fall election cycle — not as the near-daily host of the coronavirus task force update briefings, but as the president who handed off the problem to federal agencies.

He could then claim success if the pandemic does indeed die down, or run against those very agencies if the pandemic worsens or stages a rebound in the fall, as some experts suspect will happen.

Advertisement

He could then try to claim that he had the problem under control and the rest of the government messed it up. Yes, Trump is trying to angle himself to turn the coronavirus to his political advantage (nothing new there).

That would put Trump in his favorite role — as the aggrieved victim of the “deep state,” the entrenched government establishment and the “hostile press,” which in his view (or in his cynical lie to his base supporters) is in cahoots with Democrats to stifle the revolution he has been leading, and which stands in the way of his mission to “keep America great.”

That would give our dishonest president a platform from which to claim he needs to be reelected — to finish the job hardworking (and sometimes xenophobic) Americans sent him there to do. Namely, blow it all up ... er, drain the swamp.

But what, you ask, of the health and the security of the American people?

Two terrible months of quarantining at home, staying six feet from other people, washing your hands raw, avoiding social gatherings and wearing face coverings outside (sometimes, at least) have paid off.

Coronavirus infections and COVID-19 deaths have been kept in check in the most populous state. Better yet, hospitalizations for people sickened by COVID-19 appear to have started going down from last week’s peak.

California’s current totals — 54,937 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,254 deaths — may sound bad, but some public health experts had expected things to be much, much worse at this point. Instead, hospitals haven’t been overrun with sick people. Bodies weren’t stacked up in trucks. And now, after weeks of furious efforts to increase capacity, testing is up to 30,000 people a day statewide. The state has 24 million medical-grade face masks for healthcare providers. More than 10,000 ventilators are sitting idle, and there are 2,072 empty hospital beds.

These are more than just encouraging statistics. Together they mark an important inflection point for the state. California finally begins to reopen this week, albeit slowly and carefully. And it’s vital that we not move faster than it’s safe to go.

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Monday that conditions have been met for the state to move into the second of four stages he had outlined for responding to the pandemic. (The first stage was shutting things down.) This means that as soon as Friday, many retail stores and manufacturing sites that the government had labeled nonessential in the first stage can start to reopen to customers, albeit without reopening their doors to them. Instead, they’ll have to limit their interactions to curbside pickup. Later this month, offices may be allowed to open as well, provided they have configured workspaces to curb transmission of the virus.

This is a moment to celebrate, to be sure. But in a socially distanced way. The worst thing would be for this news to lull anyone into thinking COVID-19 is on the run, and it’s time to party like it’s 2019. The pandemic is still raging globally, and hundreds of Americans are still dying every day. Although the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the experimental drug remdesivir raises hopes for a new treatment for COVID-19 patients, there’s only a limited supply of the medication. It will be months before there are enough doses for everyone who needs it, and remdesivir may not be the answer for patients with highly advanced cases. Meanwhile, a vaccine is still a year, or even years, away, assuming it’s even possible to make a safe and effective one.

For many places, the worst is yet to come. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now projects that deaths from COVID-19 in the United States could more than double by June to 3,000 a day, due in large part to premature lifting of social distancing rules in other states. If that happens here, the governor said, we will have to return to more restrictions.

Nobody wants to go back, which makes it imperative that Californians continue observing social distancing and protective measures, such as wearing face coverings in public places and not gathering in large numbers. We know it works, and it’s the only way to reach the important next stage, when most of us will be cleared to go back to work, assuming there’s a job to go to.

Advertisement

Newsom also said Monday that he would be allowing some regions, such as rural counties that have seen relatively few cases of COVID-19, to lift pandemic restrictions more quickly — so long as they can demonstrate that they’re adhering to the guidelines set by the state’s public health officers. Presumably, this is in reaction to the rebellions in recent days in enclaves such as Modoc County, which defied the state’s stay-at-home order by allowing businesses to reopen this week if they took certain safety measures.

Modoc is one of four California counties that has not logged a single coronavirus case, and it makes sense to allow all of them to restart their economies at a faster pace, though with restrictions on large group gatherings and other appropriate precautions. The pandemic has largely been a problem for urban areas, and cities such as Los Angeles must continue to observe pandemic restrictions for the moment.

So, here’s to the first bit of good news in what seems like an endless spring of despair. Let’s do what it takes to make sure it’s not the last one.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-05/editorial-california-is-starting-to-re-open-dont-let-it-backslide
['Jeffrey W. Hornung'],2020-05-05,Op-Ed: China’s latest ‘charm offensive’: Using mask diplomacy to divert world attention from its misdeeds,"We’ve seen something like this before. Straight from its well-versed playbook, China has gone on a “charm offensive” to try to make the world forget Beijing’s culpability in the coronavirus crisis. This time, the charm offensive comes in the form of masks and ventilators.

A decade ago, it was common to hear China advocate for its peaceful rise. Regional countries had nothing to worry about, or so the narrative went. That charm offensive turned out to be a ruse. By the mid-2010s, China had embarked on an aggressive maritime campaign against its neighbors. Whether it was employing military and paramilitary assets against Japan in the East China Sea or pursuing large-scale artificial island building in the South China Sea, the peaceful rise narrative proved to be a distraction from Beijing’s true intentions.

Echoes of this behavior can be seen in China’s response to COVID-19 and behavior vis-à-vis its neighbors. Despite China’s denial, there is ample evidence to believe that the coronavirus began in China. Early on, Chinese leadership apparently knew the epidemic was out of control. Worse, it hid the extent of the outbreak from the international community, doing everything in its power to cover up its culpability.

To divert the world’s attention, China has provided coronavirus-related aid to hundreds of countries that include tens of millions of masks, millions of testing kits, and ventilators, including 1,000 for New York. This makes for good news but belies China’s actions against neighbors struggling with the pandemic. In the few short months since COVID-19 began spreading beyond China’s borders, China has continued — and in some cases escalated — provocations against its neighbors, both in the air and maritime domains, to challenge sovereignty claims as these states struggle with the weight of the pandemic.

Advertisement

The U.S. State Department has criticized China for several actions in the South China Sea that include announcing new “research stations” on military bases it built on Fiery Cross Reef and Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands; landing military aircraft on Fiery Cross Reef; and continuing to deploy maritime militia around the islands. From mid-February to mid-March, China also successfully extracted a world record amount of natural gas from the South China Sea. And in early April, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing trawler in the South China Sea.

Farther north, China has been similarly contentious against its neighbors. The country has conducted an aggressive disinformation campaign against Taiwan, and China’s military has been engaging in overtly provocative behavior against the island — making airspace incursions, holding nighttime exercises and sailing naval ships nearby, including an aircraft carrier.

China has also been relentless against Japan around the Senkaku Islands, a set of small islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but claimed by China.

Advertisement

Data show that Chinese vessels entered waters in Japan’s contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands for most of January, February and March. Chinese ships also went into the Senkaku’s territorial waters several times between January and March. These trends are continuing.

Since China’s neighbors are all struggling to contain and overcome the economic, health and societal problems unleased by COVID-19, China appears to be taking advantage of its neighbors’ distraction, while using simplistic “mask diplomacy” to try to get other nations to forget about Beijing’s role in the pandemic.

China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, has denied the accusation that China is trying to take advantage of its neighbors’ struggles with the pandemic, saying the country “would like to share China’s good practice and experience” but “will not turn it into any kind of geopolitical weapon or tool.”

The denial sounds eerily familiar. In 2016, China’s vice foreign minister, Liu Zhenmin, tried to dissuade Malaysian concerns about China’s charm offensive as nothing more than checkbook diplomacy, saying, “There is no such thing as using our financial muscle to improve ties.”

Advertisement

Countries should not allow themselves to be fooled again. If China were genuinely concerned with other nations during this global pandemic, most observers would expect its behavior to change.

Other countries have hit pause on conflicts to battle their common biological enemy. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates — at war with Yemen’s Houthi rebels — unilaterally declared a cease-fire to help prevent COVID-19 spread in Yemen. Similarly in Libya, both sides in an ongoing conflict agreed to a cease-fire so the country can focus on battling the outbreak. Likewise, in Latin America, the National Liberation Army, a revolutionary left-wing armed group in Colombia, unilaterally declared a cease-fire as a humanitarian gesture to the Colombian people. And in Africa, the Southern Cameroons Defense Forces militia announced it would implement a cease-fire because of the outbreak.

Even in China’s own neighborhood, regional countries are resisting the temptation to leverage COVID-19 as an opportunity for gain. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte unilaterally declared a cease-fire with communist rebels as the government tries to contain the outbreak. The Barisan Revolusi Nasional rebels fighting the Thai government also unilaterally declared that they would halt their activities due to the virus, their first cease-fire in the long-running Thai conflict.

These cease-fires, taken by groups that have often performed horrible acts against their neighbors and their own countrymen, demonstrate how militaries and even rebel groups can put the universal good above their own interests in this time of pandemic spread. What China is doing against its neighbors is anything but that. Even Chinese military experts have admitted as much, saying that recent military drills by the Chinese military showed “it is capable of driving intruders and unfriendly priers away” at a time “COVID-19 has significantly lowered the U.S. Navy’s warship deployment capability in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Don’t let masks and ventilators fool. There is an opportunity to be had, and China appears unlikely to waste it.

['Jonah Goldberg'],2020-05-05,Column: The White House plays dumb on the pandemic’s China connection,"The future is particularly murky these days. It’s anybody’s guess how the pandemic, the presidential election and the economy are going to play out. Just about the only thing that’s assured is that U.S. relations with China will never be the same.

Businesses are radically rethinking their supply chains and whether you call the rest of us voters or consumers, attitudes toward China are souring. A recent Harris poll found that two-thirds of Democrats and 9 out of 10 Republicans hold China responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. Already, a slew of lawsuits have been leveled against the Chinese government. The West’s political orientation toward China is shifting too, as countries around the world increasingly point fingers at Beijing.

In short, the issue isn’t whether a China-U.S. reckoning is coming, only whether we’re smart or dumb about it.

Early on, the knee-jerk response from Democrats, the World Health Organization, much of the media and the Chinese government itself, was to claim that any criticism of the Chinese government’s actions was bigoted or xenophobic.

On the merits, this is ridiculous. The Chinese government is a cruel and oppressive regime. Its refusal to be transparent and cooperative with the international community has been outrageous, and it’s not bigoted to say so. But the CCP, the Communist Party of China, is not “the Chinese” or even “China,” and blanket-blaming a whole nation and its people for a pandemic makes no sense. It’s as dumb, in other words, as stipulating that any negative word about Beijing is xenophobic.

The current debate over the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is another excellent example of how dumb we can be about criticizing China. The claim that the virus originated in a Chinese lab is not synonymous with the deranged conspiracy theory that the Chinese created the virus and purposefully unleashed it.

There is no evidence that the virus is man-made; scientists would be able to tell with genetic sequencing. Nor is it plausible that China’s interests would be served by the deliberate release on its own soil. A more credible — but unproven — theory is that the Chinese were studying the virus and it could have been accidentally released. Or it may also have emerged “naturally,” as the Chinese government contends, from a Wuhan meat market.

As the question of where the virus came from has heated up, Republican China hawks, in and out of the administration, rarely volunteer that they don’t mean “man-made” when they say “originated.” And much of the media coverage similarly ignores or downplays this distinction. Some pro-Trump media personalities seem eager to fuel anti-Chinese sentiments while the anti-Trump crowd seem to prefer to see a more mockable conspiracy theory.

This mutually beneficial ambiguity gets a boost from the Trump administration’s vacillation over how much blame it wants to assign to China and how it wants to direct it, all with an eye toward riling up its base and distracting from its early missteps in combating the pandemic.

On the one hand, President Trump values his personal relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and covets a major trade deal with him. Trump is on the record praising Xi’s coronavirus leadership and he remains reluctant to criticize Xi directly. On the other hand, the president and many of his advisors and surrogates relish having a new evil empire to galvanize support around.

(The schizophrenic nature of all this is ironically analogous to conservative criticism of the Trump administration. A slew of pro-Trump politicians and media figures are sharply critical of the administration’s response to the pandemic while simultaneously refusing to criticize Trump. The result is heated talk of states needing to be “liberated” from governors following the president’s guidelines and presidential advisors being scapegoated for presidential decisions.)

The ambiguity about China’s misdeeds was on display during the Sunday talk shows.

When Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo told ABC’s Martha Raddatz that “China has a history of infecting the world,” Raddatz admirably asked, “Do you believe it was man-made or genetically modified?” Pompeo replied, “Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point.” After Raddatz, again admirably, pointed out that the exact opposite is the case, that experts including the U.S. intelligence community believe it is not man-made, Pompeo said, “That’s right, I agree with that.” Then he went on to make a defensible case against the Chinese government, never mentioning Xi by name.

It’s surely possible he merely misspoke. But his dancing back and forth between dumb and smart was at minimum symbolic of an administration that wants to have it both ways.

Anger at Xi’s government is warranted, as is a recalibration of our relationship with China in the long aftermath of the pandemic. But treating a nuclear and economic superpower as an existential enemy primarily to satisfy domestic political needs — during an economic and public health crisis — strikes me as the dumbest way to go.

['Daniel T. Willingham'],2020-05-04,Op-Ed: State lockdowns have become politically divisive. Here’s how we can come together,"Americans are in the midst of a moral dilemma as stark as any in the Bible. If we end the lockdown, deaths from COVID-19 will increase, but if we maintain it, the astounding unemployment rate will move still higher.

The problem would be tragic enough, but now it’s become politicized and has further divided Americans. Research on how people think about dire choices may help governors bring us together on this issue.

In one sense, the choice ought to be easy, because preserving life is what psychologists call a “sacred value.” Sacred values are not simply important, they are nonnegotiable — a human life is considered priceless — and people angrily condemn those who say otherwise.

In an experiment testing this value, subjects read about a hospital administrator who had to choose between spending a million dollars either on a life-saving operation for a child or on salary raises to ensure the best doctors stayed at the hospital. Subjects were outraged if the story described the administrator as considering the raises, even if he ultimately made the right choice. Similar outrage was directed at an Antioch, Calif., city planning commissioner last week when he suggested that the elderly and the homeless should be left to die in the pandemic, given that they are a drain on society.

Advertisement

It might seem, then, that Americans will support extreme measures, including an indefinite lockdown, to save lives. But the situation became more complicated when demonstrators in Michigan, California and other states framed the argument to end the coronavirus quarantine as a matter of “liberty” on the logic that each of us has the right to live as we wish, even at the risk of contracting COVID-19. That doubtless strikes some as mere rhetoric, but liberty is, for many Americans, a sacred value. “Give me liberty or give me death!” is invoked with patriotic admiration, not ridicule.

What happens when sacred values — human life and liberty — are pitted against each another?

People usually view a clash of sacred values as tragic. When researchers changed the hospital administrator story so that an organ-donor shortage caused him to have to choose which of two children’s lives to save, subjects felt pathos, not anger. So did Americans when they heard stories of Italian doctors forced to ration life-saving ventilators among extremely ill COVID-19 patients.

Advertisement

Why, then, is the question of when and how to relax the lockdown not evoking pathos, but anger? Partly because defenders of each value claim that the other value is not really threatened. People who want to extend the lockdown aren’t focused on the dire costs of economic downturns, such as increases in substance abuse and suicides; they are ridiculing protesters who are upset they can’t get a haircut.

Likewise, those who want to end the lockdown don’t trivialize the sacred value that’s getting in their way (human life) but instead suggest it’s not threatened; they compare COVID-19 to seasonal influenza, or they suggest that “amazing” medications are at hand.

In addition to belittling the opposing position, we are likely to overlook times we violate our own sacred values. Americans may say they cherish life, yet we do, as a society, tolerate deaths for economic reasons; surely Medicare and the Veteran’s Administration Hospital system could save more lives if they were better funded. We even tolerate deaths to protect trivial pleasures. For example, there’s no law against eating raw oysters, even though the practice kills about 100 people each year.

Likewise, Americans say they love liberty, but they don’t protest the numerous impositions on their freedom meant to protect their safety, including donning a helmet before riding a bicycle or removing shoes to deal with heightened security at airports.

Advertisement

The fact that people trivialize others’ points of view and overlook their own hypocrisy helps explain why people are so angry over the quarantine. But governors won’t bring their constituents together by calling them out for their inconsistencies. What’s a better strategy?

Research shows that when constituencies conflict around sacred values, anger can be reduced if each side shows some willingness to sacrifice. Consider an experiment testing Israeli West Bank settlers and Palestinian students, majorities of whom said they would never negotiate on their sacred values (yielding West Banks lands, and sovereignty over Jerusalem, respectively), even for the sake of peace. Researchers found that suggesting cash settlements as part of a peace deal prompted outrage. But a suggestion that the opposing side would yield on a matter touching their sacred value defused anger and made people more open to negotiation.

Governors can bring Americans together by showing that all values — life, liberty and economic security — matter. To satisfy those who feel their liberty (and the economy) are compromised, governors should redouble their efforts for aggressive testing, so that the quarantine can apply only to those who really need it. To address those concerned about potential loss of life, governors should support vigorous quarantine laws for the sick with actual consequences for violators, as well as the tracking of contacts.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to reopen California in phases, beginning this week, offers a useful model for other states. Localities will have increased authority to set their own pace, but they must demonstrate capacity in testing and contact-tracing to move forward.

The pandemic has wreaked havoc on virtually every aspect of American life. We can at least seek to protect our regard for one another.

Attorneys filed papers Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court to dismiss five lawsuits filed or backed by the Madison Square Garden Co. that opposed the arena project.

The move came the day after Clippers owner Steve Ballmer closed on his $400-million purchase of the Forum from MSG, settling a dispute that started when the Clippers announced their arena project in June 2017.

MSG sued Inglewood and Mayor James T. Butts Jr. over the arena in 2018, alleging the company was tricked into surrendering its lease to use vacant city-owned land for overflow parking at the Forum. That land would be used to make way for the arena project. Murphy’s Bowl LLC, the Clippers-controlled company behind the project, countersued. The bitter litigation included the production of internal emails, text messages and scores of depositions, among them Ballmer, New York Knicks owner and MSG executive chairman James Dolan, and Lakers owner Jeanie Buss.

MSG sued a city-related agency later in 2018 and, earlier this year, sued Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state’s Joint Legislative Budget Committee over legislation that fast-tracked the project.

According to court filings, MSG paid legal fees for a community group called Inglewood Residents Against Takings and Evictions, or IRATE, that filed two lawsuits over the arena.

The group lost the first case, which accused Inglewood of violating state environmental law, but appealed. A second case targeted city-related agencies. Both cases were among those included in the motions to dismiss Tuesday.

Among the caveats in the agreement for MSG to sell the Forum is the requirement for the company to provide a list of “every person, entity, or organization, who is, or has ever been, a member of IRATE.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2020-05-05/clippers-inglewood-arena-lawsuits-dismissed-msg-forum-sale

Plenty of unknowns remain about the return of live professional sporting events, but one thing is certain: Fans will not be in attendance for the foreseeable future.

NASCAR announced that its premier Cup Series season will restart without fans May 17. The PGA Tour will restart June 11 with no fans for at least its first four events. They’ll follow in the footsteps of the WWE, which has held events, including Wrestlemania, without fans for two months.

The timeline is slower for major team sports leagues. They must account for more people — players, coaching staffs, officials, etc. — essential to the operation. Widespread testing for the coronavirus is considered a prerequisite.

Major League Baseball suspended operations during spring training March 12, but officials are confident they can hold some form of a regular season. NBA officials remain hopeful the league can salvage its regular season and playoffs. The NHL ruled out playing at neutral sites and the latest plan is to hold playoff games in NHL venues in four “hub” cities to minimize travel. It is considering playing into October and delaying the start of the 2020-21 season.

MLS will reopen training facilities for players next week and is tentatively scheduled to resume its season June 8. The WNBA is contemplating quarantining teams and playing in one neutral location. The NFL has time to wait it out.

None of the leagues are expected to have fans at games to start — possibly into 2021. They will be made for television with billions of dollars at stake.

It will be uncharted territory, for the most part. Only MLB and the PGA Tour have held events without fans. The American Hockey League, the NHL’s top minor league, has also staged games without fans.

They were similar in their strangeness. Here’s a look at those few examples, and a peek into what temporarily will be our new normal.

No fans were allowed to attend the Orioles-White Sox game at Camden Yards on April 29, 2015 because of unrest in Baltimore.

The only MLB game played without fans happened five years ago last week. The Baltimore Orioles and Chicago White Sox played at an empty Camden Yards after unrest surfaced in response to Baltimore resident Freddie Gray’s death in police custody.

Riots forced MLB to cancel the first two games of the series. The finale was moved from night to the afternoon to comply with the city’s curfew. The decision was made to not allow fans entry.

The Orioles won, 8-2, in a brisk two hours and three minutes — an unusually short game. Music and the public address announcer echoed. Players pretended to sign autographs. A ball girl did her job, protecting the empty seats behind her. Stadium employees roamed the stands for foul balls.

After the game, Orioles first baseman Chris Davis, who hit a three-run home run in the first inning, compared the atmosphere to a spring training intrasquad game. Orioles manager Buck Showalter said every word could be heard on the field.

“When you’re rounding the base and the only cheers were from outside the stadium, it’s a weird feeling,” Davis told reporters. “I’ll take any home run I can get at any time I can get it, but it’s definitely more fun when there are fans.”

The PGA Tour has held two full rounds without fans present: the third round of the 2012 AT&T National in Maryland and the final round of the 2016 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in San Diego. In both instances, fans weren’t allowed after inclement weather caused damage and toppled trees.

The third round of the AT&T National was played after a windstorm ripped through the area the previous night. The storm left more than 400,000 people and the course without power. The round began after a six-hour delay with the temperature approaching triple digits and debris on the course.

Tiger Woods chipped in for a birdie on the sixth hole, and the shot was met by silence.

“I’ve played in front of people like this, but not generally for an 18-hole competitive round,” Woods said.

Fans were allowed for the final round the next day. They watched Woods shoot a two-under 69 to come from behind for his 74th career win.

Weather caused a more recent example in hockey. On Jan. 17, 2018, the American Hockey League’s Charlotte Checkers hosted the Bridgeport Sound Tigers at Bojangles’ Coliseum. The arena was empty after six inches of ice and snow fell in the Charlotte, N.C., area and the Checkers discouraged fans from attending.

Running back Cam Akers, the Rams’ second-round draft pick, has a broader outlook.

“I’m looking forward to everything, in any way that I can, whether it’s blocking, running, catching, special teams, whatever I need to do,” Akers said last month after the Rams made him the fourth running back selected in the NFL draft. “I got my big-boy pants on and I’m ready to do it.”

Akers rushed for 1,144 yards and scored 18 touchdowns last season for Florida State.

The Rams drafted the 5-foot-10, 217-pound Akers a little more than a month after releasing Gurley, the three-time Pro Bowl selection and the 2017 NFL offensive player of the year whose balky left knee and gigantic contract convinced the Rams he was expendable.

Akers joins a running back corps that includes Gurley’s longtime backup, Malcolm Brown, second-year pro Darrell Henderson and third-year pro John Kelly.

Coach Sean McVay is expected to explore a running back-by-committee approach to make up for the void left by Gurley.

“That’s to be determined based on how things play themselves out,” McVay said when asked how he planned to divvy up carries, “and when we get a chance to actually compete in practice and in those live opportunities.”

The Rams are in the second week of their virtual offseason program. NFL facilities are closed indefinitely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so rookies might not be on the field with teammates until training camp. Rookies can begin attending virtual team meetings next Monday.

Akers said he can be “a game-changer” for a team that is in need of a spark. The Rams finished 9-7 last season and missed the playoffs for the first time in three seasons under McVay.

“As far as filling Todd Gurley’s shoes — just going to come in and play,” Akers said. “Wherever the team needs me to be, whatever they need me to do, that’s what I’ll do.”

Akers played quarterback and running back in high school in Mississippi, and displayed his passing prowess during his freshman season at Florida State. In a game against Boston College, he ran left with a handoff, and then squared his shoulders and completed an option pass that traveled more than 50 yards.

His quarterback background helps him break down defenses as a running back, he said.

“Having that edge, having that quarterback thought process when approaching the line of scrimmage and approaching every play,” he said.

Florida State finished with a 6-7 record in 2019, but Rams general manager Les Snead said Akers still showed up on film despite playing with offensive line that was not as stout as past Seminole teams. Akers joined Warrick Dunn and Dalvin Cook as the only players in Florida State history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in multiple seasons.

Louisiana State’s Clyde Edwards-Helaire, selected by the Kansas City Chiefs, was the only running back chosen in the first round of the draft last month. Georgia’s D’Andre Swift and Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor were drafted early in the second round before the Rams chose Akers with the 52nd pick.

“He runs angry,” Snead said. “He runs like he wants to punish a defense.”

Former Florida receiver Van Jefferson, the Rams’ second-round draft pick, saw Akers up close during games between the rival schools. In a loss to the Gators last season, Akers rushed for 102 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown run.

“He’s an elusive back. … a lot of times he would just break out in huge runs,” Jefferson said. “So, that always wasn’t good for being the opposing team, but I’m excited to be on the same side as him.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/sports/rams/story/2020-05-04/running-back-cam-akers-was-drafted-in-second-round-by-the-rams

1) Peanut Butter Half Baked

I’m not much of a cookie dough guy, but I can’t deny the greatness of this ice cream. Chocolate and peanut butter ice creams converge in a maelstrom of calor-rific glory and are peppered with brownie and peanut butter cookie dough chunks. Of course chocolate and peanut butter go together like Cheech and Chong; I found that the stickiness of the brownie bits offsets the graininess of the cookie dough.

To make a 1998 Bulls analogy — Jordan and Pippen are like the two ice creams. They hold it all together and do most of the work. Kukoc and Rodman are like the brownie and cookie dough chunks. Luc Longley is the … spoon? The United Center is the freezer. Phil Jackson is your conscience, telling you not to eat too much. Defensive specialist Randy Brown is the part of your brain that’s honestly just happy to be along for the ride and wants you to keep going even when Phil says to take a break.

Look, I didn’t say the analogy was perfect.



2) New York Super Fudge Chunk

If there’s one thing we loved about Ben & Jerry’s when we discovered it as kids, and what we still love about it, it’s all the stuff. Every pint of Ben & Jerry’s is just loaded with chunks of stuff.

Advertisement

New York Super Fudge Chunk is that ideal, perfected: Every cubic inch is so full of something that is not ice cream — pecans, walnuts, almonds, fudge chunks — it’s frankly a wonder they don’t market this as frozen trail mix. But this is why we love Ben & Jerry’s: We want to chew our ice cream, not merely lick it.



3) Phish food

This entry goes out to L.A. Times Food editor Peter Meehan, who was and maybe still is, the biggest Phish fan I know. You see, it’s Meehan’s fault that I purchased the Phish album “Junta” in high school, in an effort to be cooler than I was and sat for hours at home trying to make sense of lyrics like,

I look into the finance box

Just to check my status

I look into the microscope

See Golgi apparatus

While Phish never really clicked with me, this ice cream certainly does. Chocolate ice cream with marshmallow, caramel and fudge fish leave this just a few nuts away from perfection — but then it’d just be Rocky Road, wouldn’t it? Instead of what it is: an exceptional-tasting ice cream with smooth, creamy textures that let you linger and get lost inside, like a Trey Anastasio guitar solo. By far the most stoner-y of the line-up.

4) Americone Dream

The waffle cone bits make this. The smell of sweet dough appeals to anyone who’s been to a state fair or inside a Blue Bottle, and this flavor, modeled on the persona of “Report""-era Stephen Colbert, manages to capture some of that magic. The light, crunchy sweetness of the fudge-covered bits are as wistful and nostalgic as the times we thought it was funny to watch a pretend right-wing blowhard spew hatred and misinformation. Remember those days?



5) Cherry Garcia

One of the OG flavors, Cherry Garcia is still one of the best. Fun story: The flavor originated when a woman named Jane Williamson sent a postcard to the Burlington office in 1986 suggesting the flavor. It debuted the following year and became one of the company’s most popular flavors. The woman got a year’s supply of ice cream in thanks.

While she should have gotten a fat check, frankly, at least the ice cream is still good. Ben & Jerry’s doesn’t do much in the fruit arena, and it’s nice to see this flavor endure. Cherry ice cream with fat cherry chunks and flecks of chocolate? Put “American Beauty” on repeat and hook me up.

6) Mint Chocolate Cookie

Any kind of mint/chocolate combo is going to be a winner, so I’ll use this space to pose the question: What’s better, cookies or chips? I’m actually a chip person, because of the texture, but I see the position of those on team cookie. Unearthing a cookie is more enjoyable and exciting than the pervasiveness of chips, and again plays into Ben & Jerry’s M.O. of packing their pints full of huge chunks.

A classic, irrefutable flavor combination, if not the most innovative.



7) Chip Happens

Marketed as, “A cold mess of chocolate ice cream with fudge chips and crunchy potato chip swirls,” the guys took a slight gamble on this flavor that largely pays off. They didn’t put entire potato chips into the pints but instead mashed the chips and spread them throughout the mixture.

The chips stay pretty remarkably crunchy and retain most of their salty, potatoey flavor. If you’ve ever enjoyed dipping hot fries into a Wendy’s Frosty, take this for a spin.

8) Chocolate Therapy

Remember Cathy? No, not from when you had co-workers and regular human contact, the one from the comic strip who’s always saying, “Ack!” I feel like this is an ice cream Cathy might enjoy, as would the inner Cathy in each and every one of us. It says, “We heard you liked chocolate, so we put chocolate in your chocolate.”

Chocolate ice cream is swirled with chocolate pudding ice cream — an important distinction — that is dotted with chocolate cookies. The creaminess of the regular ice cream contrasts subtly with the more viscous pudding cream. The difference is small but essential and will make you want to slide right into your favorite pair of sweatpants.



9) Peanut Butter Cup

Can you possibly go wrong with peanut butter ice cream and huge peanut butter cups? Nope. The massive cups are a chunky reminder of why this brand became popular in the first place. I like to imagine, back in 1978 when Ben & Jerry’s was founded, two guys in a Burlington basement ripping a 4-foot bong and cramming whatever food they could find into their gullets. After stuffing themselves with peanut butter and chocolate and washing it down with some local full-fat milk, the idea struck them for this particular flavor of shame salve. Wouldn’t want it to go down any other way.



10) Vanilla

A surprise flavor rounding out the top ten: Good old, plain-ass vanilla. Ben & Jerry’s is actually one of the best out there. It even has the tiny bean flecks that give the ice cream a distinct psychological edge. “Wow, real flecks of vanilla bean?” you ask yourself. “They’re not messing around!” Ideal in a root beer or Coke float.

This falls extremely low on the stoner scale — right now I find a sobering pint of pure vanilla is needed to confront every fresh new workday.

11) The Tonight Dough

Love or hate Jimmy Fallon, he seems like a man who tries extremely hard at everything he does. His namesake ice cream, while good, does the same: It’s trying to be too much to too many people. Caramel ice cream and chocolate ice cream and chocolate cookies and chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough? Just... tone it down a little, dude. You’ve made it. You can relax.



12) Chocolate Fudge Brownie

A flavor that is, unlike some presidents, unimpeachable. Sticky chocolate brownies in chocolate ice cream — there’s nothing I would change.

13) Cannoli

Who knew? Cannoli: Good for ice cream, good for running errands with Clemenza and Rocco. This mixture uses mascarpone instead of the usual ricotta and comes through with a rich, custard-like flavor. The chocolate-covered pastry shell bits could be a little crisper, but they manage to capture the spirit of the Sicilian confection.



14) Oat of this Swirled

This ended up being a winner for the most part, but not for the reasons advertised — this wasn’t particularly oaty. This is ultimately a cinnamon ice cream, with tasty, satisfyingly spicy cookie swirls. The choice of laying the toppings down in a field of brown sugar ice cream was an inspired one; it gives the pint a lovely, slightly caramelized quality.



15) Everything But The …

I wish they’d just finish the sentence. Kitchen sink? Trash can lid? Refrigerator door? Ellipses don’t belong in the names of food. Regardless, this ice cream is a good mess, but it’s still a mess. Cramming peanut butter cups, toffee chunks, white chocolate pieces and fudge-covered almonds all together means no one element gets the chance to shine. Given the MedMen-icated state you’re likely in when you crack this pint open, it probably doesn’t matter.

16) Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough

Not my fave, but a classic nonetheless. Something about the gritty, sandy texture of cookie dough has always rubbed me the wrong way. I’d far rather somebody else did the work, baked the cookies and put those in my ice cream. Nevertheless, I understand the appeal, and that as a snacky shortcut, it makes sense. Ben & Jerry’s makes as good a version as you can hope to find.



17) Chunky Monkey

Honestly, I was prepared to put this flavor at No. 1 — or at least in the top five. But after trying a few bites, I just couldn’t do it: The banana flavor is off. It lacks the dense, almost booze-y sweetness of a real overripe banana, veering instead into Laffy Taffy/Runts territory. It’s about as close to a banana as grape soda is to a grape. While the chocolate chunks and walnuts are ultimately satisfying, the very raison d’etre of the pint, the titular monkey’s aspect, is a somewhat disappointing mirage.



18) Half Baked

What’s not to like? Cookie dough and brownie chunks make for a winning combination, and the ice cream proves better than the Dave Chappelle comedy of the same name. It ranks highly in the stoned category, naturally, though I don’t know it gives the unmedicated a strong reason to reach across the freezer aisle.

19) Gimme S’More

Ah, wilderness! Who among us doesn’t remember getting picked on by older kids in Scouts and then promptly drowning our sorrows in a delicious s’more seasoned with wet, salty tears? In my case, I could never quite perfect the marshmallow. I’d soon lose my patience while trying to slowly roast it and then hold the thing directly on the fire, resulting in a charred outside and nearly raw center.

Still, the flavor of graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallow takes me back. It doesn’t quite capture the trauma of growing up, but at least it’s delicious.



20) Salted Caramel Core

This is the best of the “core” ice creams, which is a Ben & Jerry’s variation I’ve never quite jibed with. Why place all of the good stuff in one centralized, predictable area? Half the fun of ice cream is the randomized chaos of not knowing exactly what you’re going to get in a given bite.

The core ice creams ruin that fun, like a deconstructed Caesar salad: Here’s a romaine leaf, there’s a wedge of cheese, a piece of toasted bread there and an egg over there. It’s too clever for its own good.

Advertisement

Then again, maybe you just want to eat the entire core? In that case, I can see a point to the approach. The salted caramel could be a little more salty, but it goes nicely with the sweet cream ice cream and chewy blondie bits.

21) Pistachio Pistachio

There are better pistachio ice creams out there. This one has nice plump nuts scattered throughout, but the flavor of the ice cream proper is off. It tastes a little like almond extract. Nevertheless, the dads out there will love it, leading to its low score on the stoner scale.



22) Vanilla Caramel Fudge

This one is smooth baby, smooth, and should probably be ranked higher than it is — I just have an affinity for stuff and this doesn’t have any stuff in it. What it lacks in the chunk department, though, it makes up for in slick, sticky sweetness. The caramel and fudge meld in a dreamy, seamless way to produce an entirely new ice cream topping, fudgamel, where you’re not quite sure where one stops and the other takes over. If you give yourself over to this ice cream, you may never come back from the edge.

Advertisement

23) Milk & Cookies

Inoffensive and, in theory, a totally fun and charming ice cream flavor. Who doesn’t love milk and cookies? What this flavor doesn’t really take into account, though, is that the pleasure of milk and cookies derives primarily from 1) the contrast of a hot cookie with cold milk and/or 2) the soaking of a cookie in the milk, leading to a pleasantly sodden cookie.

Here, neither of those sensations comes through. The cookies are crisp, and somewhat grainy, and do little to evoke any Santa-esque memories.



24) Brownie batter core

Does too much of a good thing exist? The answer is obviously “no,” but if it did, this would be it. The brownie core here is so slick and sweet, so intense, that it simply overwhelms. It’s very fudgy and extremely rich, but after a spoonful or two, it has me missing the chewiness of the regular Ben & Jerry’s brownies.



25) Justice ReMix’d

With just the slightest bit of pep in the brownies and a cinnamon-loaded bun dough, you’re on the express train to Spice City, next stop, Seasoning Station! This flavor, which was created to benefit criminal justice reform , doesn’t quite capture the magic of a fresh cinnamon bun or a spicy cup of hot chocolate, but it’s more than adequate.

26) Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake

This is the best of Ben & Jerry’s cheesecake offerings I tried, and it quite nearly works. But the cheesecake needs to be much more tangy and assertive; Right now it sort of limps along like an injured animal. Caramel and chocolate will make anything taste good, but the cheesecake, the ostensible star of the show, needs to step more into the spotlight.



27) Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core

Again with the cores. Would you order a bag of Cheetos that was separated into two compartments: Plain, unflavored corn puffs and pure, cheese powder? I mean, maybe you would. Maybe I would too.

OK, I definitely would. But that’s not the point: Like Beatles albums, ice cream is meant to be consumed as a whole, not cherry-picked for your favorite bits. Otherwise you could just buy a tube of cookie dough, right?

28) Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch

I feel like once they had to take “Heath bar” out of the name, this flavor really tanked. The toffee chunks just aren’t buttery enough; they taste mostly of sugar. The coffee ice cream lacks the deep, rich earthiness you’ll find in some of the bolder and better coffee ice creams on the market.

Think of it in terms of an improv 101 class. Make bold choices! Fully commit! Many times, that in and of itself can make the difference between hackneyed character and something truly worthy of a self-taped audition. This ice cream needs to give itself a pep talk in the hallway and give it another shot.



29) Netflix & Chilll’d

With its ready-for-Tinder name, this had the potential to be the sexiest of the entries. Peanut butter ice cream with pretzels and fudge brownies should be knock-it-out-of-the-park good! But the pretzels are chalky and dry and the brownies are tacky, not chewy, landing this somewhere near the Gatorade cooler in the dugout. Just goes to show that money can buy you more content than you’ll be able to watch in 100 lifetimes, but it can’t get you a great ice cream flavor.



30) Strawberry Cheesecake

Cheesecake needs to be tangy; Fruity ice cream needs to be fruity. This wasn’t particularly either.

Advertisement

What are you up to, strawberry cheesecake ice cream? Did you come to play? Or did you come to half-heartedly jog up and down the court and knock down a couple of early shots but, when push comes to shove, give up, fake an injury and go home? I suspect the latter, and I’m a little disappointed in you.



31) Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake Truffles

I can’t tell the difference between this and the regular Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake, but this has graham cracker-coated cheesecake “truffles” instead of regular cheesecake chunks. Why they made an entirely separate flavor with such a minute distinction is lost on me, but it wasn’t a good idea. This is the inferior product. The cheesecake has very little tang, and the graham cracker makes the bits taste slightly dusty. Pass.



32) Wake & “No Bake” Cookie Dough Core

The only flavor that I actively didn’t enjoy. The no-bake cookie dough in this wink-wink-nudge-nudge cleverly-named creation is sickly sweet with a terrible rabbit-food texture. It’s sandy and pasty like a Clif Bar, with the density and distressing flavor to match.

But to Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, I say: You’re allowed a couple of misses now and again, guys.

Lesson 33: Meatloaf

Meatloaf might not be the sexiest dish, but it has stood the test of time for a reason. It’s a crowd-pleaser that everyone loves no matter how much they may profess to liking something fancier, the Adam Sandler of dishes.

I know what you’re thinking: Do I really need a new recipe for meatloaf?

There are no new-fangled tricks or techniques in this recipe. To flavor the meat, I blend together a cheater’s maitre d’hotel butter — combining the traditional soft butter, parsley and lemon juice with shallots and garlic in a food processor. It is an old-school compound butter for serving melted over cooked steaks in French bistros and there’s no better combination of seasonings yet devised that make beef taste better. I mix the flavored butter with ground beef and a cursory amount of breadcrumbs and egg to hold it all together. That’s it.

The only vague “twist” here is to place the meatloaf in a hot skillet before it goes in the oven. The bottom gets crusty and caramelized like a hamburger patty. It’s easy to do and makes a huge difference in texture to have that crunchy part in the mix.

For the top, I stick with classic ketchup straight from the bottle. No one wants a homemade ketchup or any other flavoring to distract from the star of the show. But if you have the will to do so, I suggest stirring a tablespoon of vinegar into the ketchup first to bump up its acidic edge and cut the sweetness.

The vinegar in the ketchup, the flavored butter, and cooking the meatloaf in a heated skillet — the right amount of small nips and tucks here and there that make a classic more appealing than the uncut gem it always was.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05,Trump denies ties to Venezuelan attack; two U.S. men jailed,"President Trump said Tuesday the United States had nothing to do with an alleged incursion into Venezuela that landed two U.S. citizens behind bars in the troubled South American nation.

Trump said he had just learned of the detention of the pair, accused by Venezuela of being mercenaries. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said they were part of an operation to kill him that was backed by neighboring Colombia and the United States.

“Whatever it is, we’ll let you know,” Trump told reporters in Washington before departing from the White House to Arizona. “But it has nothing to do with our government.”

Authorities in Venezuela identified the two men as Luke Denman and Airan Berry, both former U.S. Special Forces soldiers associated with the Florida-based private security firm Silvercorp USA.

A third U.S. ex-Green Beret and Silvercorp founder, Jordan Goudreau, claimed responsibility for leading “Operation Gideon,” which was launched with an attempted beach landing before dawn on Sunday that left eight suspected attackers dead.

The two ex-U.S. soldiers were detained Monday dozens of miles from the first attempted beach landing in a fishing village. Authorities say they’ve confiscated equipment and detained dozens of others.

Goudreau said the operation was designed to capture — and not kill — Maduro. He said he carried it out on a “shoestring budget” after signing an agreement with U.S.-backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, whom Goudreau accuses of failing to pay him. Guaidó denies having any relationship with Goudreau.

Venezuela is gripped by a deepening social and economic crisis under Maduro’s rule that has led nearly 5 million residents to flee crumbling social services, such as unreliable water, electricity and broken hospitals.

The U.S. is among nearly 60 nations that back Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, saying Maduro clings to power despite a sham election in 2018 that banned the most popular opposition candidates from running.

Venezuela and the U.S. broke diplomatic ties a year ago, so there is no U.S. embassy operating in Venezuela’s capital of Caracas.

“It shocks me how insane they were,” said Mike Vigil, the former head of international operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration. “They walked right into a coiled rattlesnake without even having minimally studied the capacity of the Venezuelan armed forces. There’s no way the U.S. government would’ve supported an operation like this.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-05/trump-denies-ties-to-venezuelan-attack-with-2-us-men-jailed
"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05,"U.S. couple’s nightmare: Held in China, away from their teenage daughter","The first thing Daniel Hsu noticed about the room was that there were no sharp edges. The walls were covered with beige rubber, the table wrapped in soft gray leather. White blinds covered two barred windows.

Five surveillance cameras recorded his movements, and two guards kept constant, silent watch. They followed Hsu to the shower and stood beside him at the toilet.

Lights blazed through the night. If he rolled over on his mattress, guards woke him and made him turn his face toward a surveillance camera that recorded him as he slept. He listened for sounds of other prisoners but heard only the occasional roar of a passing train.

“First, keep healthy,” Hsu told himself. “Second, keep strong.”

He had no idea when or how he would get out.

Hsu is a U.S. citizen. He has not been convicted of any crime in China, yet he was detained there for six months in solitary confinement under conditions that could qualify as torture under international conventions. Authorities from eastern Anhui province placed exit bans on Hsu and his wife, Jodie Chen, blocking them from returning home to suburban Seattle in August 2017 and effectively orphaning their 16-year-old daughter in America.

Critics say the Chinese Communist Party’s expanding use of exit bans to block people — including U.S. citizens and permanent residents — from leaving China reeks of hostage-taking and collective punishment. They also warn that it lays bare China’s will to exert influence not just over Chinese citizens in China, but also permanent residents and citizens of other countries.

“American citizens are too often being detained as de facto hostages in business disputes or to coerce family members to return to China. This is shocking and unacceptable behavior by the Chinese government and a clear violation of international law,” said James P. McGovern, chair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China.

Hsu says Anhui authorities have been effectively holding them hostage in order to convince his father, Xu Weiming, to come back from the U.S. and face charges he embezzled 447,874 yuan (worth $63,000 today) more than 20 years ago — an allegation Xu denies.

The COVID-19 pandemic has added grave new urgency to their desire to leave. Despite fear of retribution, the family is speaking out for the first time, offering a rare account of life inside China’s opaque system of exit bans and secretive detention centers.

Their story is supported by Chinese court documents and correspondence and interviews with U.S. and Chinese government officials. Some details could not be independently verified but are in line with accounts from other detainees.

Five days before Hsu entered the smooth beige room at a Communist Party-run “education center” in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province, his stepdaughter, Mandy Luo, boarded a flight from Shanghai to Seattle alone. She had been on a family visit to China and was supposed to return with her mother to finish high school. But airport security had blocked her mother from boarding.

Mandy vomited for 10 hours on the flight home. “Mom,” she kept thinking, “why are you not here?”

The answer to that question lies in Chinese laws that give authorities broad discretion to block both Chinese citizens and foreign nationals from leaving the country. Minor children, a pregnant woman and a pastor — all with foreign passports — have been banned from exiting, according to people with direct knowledge of the cases.

The U.S., Canada and Australia have issued advisories warning their citizens that they can be prevented from leaving China over disputes they may not be directly involved in.

“U.S. diplomats frequently raise the issue of exit bans and the need for transparency with the PRC government,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email. “The Department has raised Mr. Hsu’s case at the highest levels and will continue to do so until he is allowed to return home to the U.S.”

Within China, exit bans have been celebrated as part of a best-practices toolkit for convincing corrupt officials to return to China for prosecution, part of President Xi Jinping’s sweeping campaign to purify the ruling Communist Party and shore up its moral authority. Many corruption suspects fled to the U.S., Australia and Canada, which do not have extradition treaties with China.

Requests for comment to Anhui province’s Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, Public Security Department and procuratorate, as well as the province’s foreign affairs and propaganda offices all went unanswered. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing declined to comment.

Hsu was accused of being a co-conspirator in the corruption case against his father, Xu. The Hefei Intermediate People’s Court found that Xu embezzled money for real estate in the 1990s while serving as chairman of Shanghai Anhui Yuan Industrial Corp. At the time, Hsu was half a world away, studying accounting at the University of San Francisco.

Xu denies the charges. In a letter to the court, he wrote that the money was a housing stipend, vetted by a government audit committee and awarded to dozens of employees. He said he is the target of a political vendetta.

“If my dad’s rich, OK, I deserve this maybe,” said Hsu, who ran a barbecue restaurant in Bellevue, Wash., which he was forced to sell during his involuntary exile. “But I never enjoy anything. I don’t have a Ferrari. I don’t have a yacht. I’m just a small business owner.”

His interrogations came in fits and starts. He gazed at the smooth edges in his room and thought about hurting himself. He fantasized that a Delta Force chopper would rescue him. The men would break through the walls and say, “You’re free, sir. Come with us.” No one came.

“Try to sit in a room for three hours and tell me how do you feel, just by yourself. You have nothing,” he said in an interview.

Before coming to the party education center, Hsu had spent 14 days in detention in Hefei, sharing a cell and one bucket toilet with two dozen men. Hsu asked police to send him back. At least there were other people, TV, chess. Even his cellmate who allegedly murdered his girlfriend was kind of nice.

In mid-September police gave Hsu a phone so he could convince his parents to return. His mother told him they’d written letters to Washington. “Be strong,” she said. “I am proud of you.”

After a few days, the phone was taken away. Hsu had been given a mission, to convince his father to return, and he had failed.

Hsu was being held under “residential surveillance in a designated location,” a legal mechanism that allows detentions of up to six months without formal charges or judicial review in certain cases.

The United Nations has urged Beijing to halt the practice, saying it “may amount to incommunicado detention in secret places, putting detainees at a high risk of torture or ill-treatment.”

China is a signatory to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which defines torture as an intentional abuse of power by the state that causes severe physical or mental suffering. It signed, but did not ratify, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which precludes torture as well as “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.”

Joshua Rosenzweig, a deputy regional director at Amnesty International in Hong Kong, said that though residential surveillance sounds better than throwing someone in jail, in practice it’s one of the most excruciating forms of detention under Chinese law. In Hsu’s case, he said, prolonged solitary confinement and 24-hour surveillance seemed designed to cause psychological suffering with the aim of coercing him to do something.

“That would clearly satisfy the criteria for torture and other ill treatment,” Rosenzweig said. “The ability, inside a black box, to carry out this kind of coercion against someone — it’s incredible this is allowed to go on.”

Over time, and late at night, Hsu’s guards relaxed. Hsu discovered one was a fan of Manchester United. Others wanted to know what the schools were like America and how much real estate cost. Eventually, he said, he got one guy to bring him a caramel macchiato from Starbucks.

In December, police announced that Hsu’s father had agreed to go back to China. Hsu was shocked. On Dec. 14, a consular officer came with news that his father had made a sworn statement declaring Hsu’s innocence.

His mother also sent word that her husband’s health was poor and he would postpone his return.

Hsu held his fists and began to shake.

The next morning, his minders yelled at him. They made him make a videotaped message. Hsu told his parents they should have kept their word and returned. He wrote a letter, telling them he was getting sick in his head, pulling his hair out, not sleeping.

The new rotation of guards refused to speak to him. He dreamed about his daughter and woke in the night, his face wet with tears.

Back in Seattle, Mandy was also struggling with solitude. But she didn’t want to add to the general misery, so she boxed up the rage and helplessness. Instead of shouting at her relatives, she wept in her family’s big, empty house.

“Why me?” she cried out, to no one in particular. “I’m only 16. What are you expecting of me?”

On Feb. 11, 2018, near the end of Hsu’s sixth month in detention, he was released. His wife, Jodie Chen, drove nine hours to pick him up. They tossed his prison books in a dumpster and went out to dinner.

Hsu watched his wife eat. He couldn’t bring himself to hug her.

After sleeping under blazing lights for six months, he could no longer sleep in the dark. Shanghai’s jostling crowds made him nervous. He kept crying.

Hsu, 43, and Chen, 44, were living off savings. Their marriage was rapidly deteriorating. When they weren’t fighting, they sat at home and stared at each other.

Friends offered Hsu jobs or money to start a restaurant in Shanghai. But he always declined, worried he’d get them in trouble.

The U.S. Consulate in Shanghai lobbied intensively on the couple’s behalf. But nothing changed.

In May 2019, immigration officers came to Hsu’s home and told him they were going to deport him because his visa had expired. They warned him he’d never be able to return to China.

“I said, ‘We can talk about that later, but deport me, please.’”

They didn’t.

In June 2019, Hsu and Chen missed their daughter’s high school graduation. In August, they recruited relatives to see her off to college.

Last month, at the request of Anhui authorities, Chen wrote a formal petition for her exit ban to be lifted.

“I miss my daughter so much, especially at this critical moment,” she wrote. “I do hope to take care of her, side by side, to fulfill my duty as a mother.”

She pledged to persuade her father-in-law to return to China, saying she would deepen her emotional bond with her in-laws to establish mutual trust, then explain the “tolerant and humanized approach” of Chinese justice.

It was unclear why Chen’s exit ban was lifted. Hsu would have to stay in China. “They told me if my dad is not coming back, I will never leave this country,” he said.

On April 10, Chen and Hsu rode to Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport in a diplomatic sedan, a small American flag on the hood flapping in the wind. The Shanghai consul general, Sean Stein, escorted Chen to the departure gate.

Chen’s trip back to Seattle took more than 24 hours. Concerned she might have picked up COVID-19 on the journey, she took an Uber from the airport to the leafy cul-de-sac they call home.

It had been 971 days since Chen had touched her daughter. She had planned to self-quarantine for two weeks, but Mandy couldn’t wait. She moved from her grandparents’ house and went into quarantine with her mother.

“It’s 50% over,” Mandy said. “My dad is the other 50%.”

Back in Shanghai, Daniel Hsu went home from Pudong airport and slept most of the day.

The refrain is the same every evening: praise for China’s handling of the coronavirus, dire scenes from foreign hospitals and condemnations of the United States.

The tone is often withering. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo was declared “the public enemy of humanity.” A few nights later, the anchor feigned sympathy for Americans, who she said were left to die while their government railed against China.

Beijing has pushed this story line at home for months — a mixture of self-congratulation for defeating the virus, denial of central government missteps, and horror at other countries’ failures to contain the pandemic.

Now, facing escalating international criticism over its handling of the outbreak and growing demands for an investigation into its origins, China has taken its strident nationalist message abroad. The strategy is provoking a backlash and colliding with President Trump’s insistence that China covered up the danger of the pathogen.

The undiplomatic invective matches the swagger of Xi Jinping’s China, which is richer and more influential than ever, and determined to shape the global narrative as it believes a superpower should — especially as the Chinese president confronts the biggest crisis of his tenure. Beijing sees itself as ascendant at a time that the United States’ stature as a world leader is ebbing.

Chinese ambassadors are attacking foreign officials on social media and peddling misinformation — amplified by the state-controlled press — to deflect blame for the virus that has killed a quarter of a million people and wrecked global economies.

The latest spat erupted last week after the Chinese ambassador to Australia appeared to threaten a consumer boycott over Australia’s calls for an independent inquiry into the outbreak. The Australian government accused Beijing, its biggest trading partner, of economic coercion; China denied it and warned Canberra to stop playing “political games.”

The editor of Global Times, a popular tabloid run by the Chinese Communist Party, weighed in on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, comparing Australia to “gum stuck to the bottom of China’s shoe: Sometimes you have to find a rock and scrape it off.”

Rising to China’s defense is a generation of diplomats and pundits dubbed the “Wolf Warriors,” after a recent pair of blockbuster action films featuring a muscled, globe-trotting Chinese commando who vanquishes Asian drug lords, African pirates and mercenaries led by a villainous American named Big Daddy.

The diplomats’ fields of battle are social media platforms — usually Twitter and Facebook, which are banned in China. Their weapons include outrage, sarcasm, an abiding suspicion of Western governments and the press, conspiracy theories and, it seems, the support of the Chinese leadership.

“In this environment in China, there’s no punishment for people who are overzealous in defending China,” said Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London. “You’re not going to lose your job if you overstep. Everyone is trying to demonstrate their loyalty.”

Wang Yong, professor of international studies at Peking University, called the “more assertive” style of some diplomats “a reaction to the blaming of China and China’s policies in fighting the pandemic” — especially by the United States.

U.S. news media have reported on China’s initial attempts to play down the scale of the outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, and on problems with medical equipment it has sent to other countries. The allegations have blunted Beijing’s own spin: that it has defeated the virus and is leading the medical and humanitarian response to the outbreak.

The Trump administration, under fire for its own missteps, has increasingly emphasized the pandemic’s origins. Pompeo has claimed the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory — which scientists say is unlikely — and said over the weekend that “China has a history of infecting the world.”

“The old way is to always accept: ‘China does this, China does that,’ an agenda set by American politicians,” Wang said. “I think now Americans should have a second thought about this approach.”

A decade ago, Beijing’s diplomats kept a low profile in world capitals — dark-suited sphinxes who rarely engaged with the press or the public. In the Wolf Warrior era — with China and the U.S. locked in a bitter struggle over trade, technological primacy and geopolitical influence — their combative statements fly like arrows from embassies around the globe.

“Ridiculous and eyeball-catching nonsense,” tweeted the spokeswoman for the Chinese Embassy in India, responding to demands that China pay compensation for the spread of the virus.

“Other countries shouldn’t blame China for mistakes they have made themselves, particularly the U.S.,” tweeted the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands.

The Chinese Embassy in Venezuela ended an angry Twitter thread — which began by complaining about Venezuelan officials referring to the “Chinese coronavirus” — by saying that some of its critics could “put on a mask and shut up.”

Offensive and gratuitous, to some. But the Global Times, in a recent article, said China’s people “are no longer satisfied with a flaccid diplomatic tone.”

The star among the Wolf Warriors is Zhao Lijian, a 47-year-old recently installed as a deputy spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Zhao came to prominence last year when, as the No. 2 at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, he got into a Twitter feud with former U.S. national security advisor Susan Rice, who called him a “racist disgrace.”

In March, Zhao suggested on Twitter that the U.S. Army had smuggled the virus into Wuhan. The unfounded conspiracy theory was echoed in state media, but raised eyebrows among more moderate members of China’s diplomatic corps, including the ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, who said it was “very harmful” to speculate about the virus’ origins.

“Lijian is representative of a group of younger spokespersons who are unapologetic,” Brown said. “The mindset is not about keeping a low profile. They feel they shouldn’t have to be in that position because they don’t see Americans or Europeans going around the world bowing their heads and apologizing, so why should they?”

Analysts say the pandemic has revealed China’s willingness to expand its use of disinformation campaigns — previously focused on undermining pro-democracy voices in Taiwan and Hong Kong — to the wider world. As early as 2015, scholars from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies predicted that the People’s Liberation Army would use Twitter to deliver propaganda to new audiences “to influence the global conversation about China.”

“Beijing has been playing this game for a long time in Taiwan and Hong Kong,” said Nadege Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington. “It has all the necessary architecture to deploy such tactics and has garnered a great deal of experience in previous disinformation campaigns.”

Wang, of Peking University, acknowledged that the Wolf Warrior style had sparked a debate within the party, although he declined to say whether such behavior would help China’s image globally.

“We are in a new context, new circumstances,” he said. “The diplomats and government officials will learn from the process, from the reaction of others, what is the best way of communication.”

Part of the strategy was laid out in a recent article on a website run by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It proposed tactics that included: a 24-hour, rapid-response operation to quickly answer attacks; promoting Chinese social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat as alternatives to Twitter and Facebook; discussing China’s shortcomings where they exist; and remaining “calm and objective” while convincing people “through reason.”

So far, however, the pugnacious voices are resounding, threatening China’s ties with other nations.

In Australia, which relies on China as a market for iron ore and other exports, and is a major destination for Chinese tourists and students, the prospect of an economic boycott by Beijing drew condemnations from across the political spectrum.

“It was already dawning on many Australians that the strategic risk of overdependence on China was a problem that needed to be resolved,” said Ashley Townshend, director of foreign policy at the United States Studies Center in Australia.

“The pandemic and China’s issuance of threats will quicken those calls for our own increased resilience.”

But analysts say the menacing tone feeds patriotic sentiment in China, where the party is eager to limit the damage of an outbreak that has killed thousands and tipped the economy into decline for the first time in at least three decades.

Foreign criticism “strikes right at the heart of one of the myths that the party has been cultivating to bolster its legitimacy at home: that the [Chinese Communist Party] is efficient, competent and capable, and that it is the only one able to effectively lead the nation,” Rolland said.

Shortly after Xi was named the party’s general secretary in 2012 — on his way to becoming the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong — he reportedly said in a speech that one of the reasons the Communist Party collapsed in the Soviet Union was that “nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.”

“I think that Chinese diplomats are currently trying to show that they are man enough to stand up for the CCP,” Rolland said.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05,"75 years after World War II, search for missing soldiers continues","Thomas Siepert looks across the verdant grain field, which glows in the sun after a spring thunderstorm, with windmills slowly churning in the distance. Wild boar piglets trundle across the road into town, and a hare pops out and dashes away.

The serene scene belies the slaughter 75 years ago on the same patch of land as German troops fought furiously — and futilely — to stave off the Soviet Red Army, which was approaching Berlin.

“It seems so idyllic, but it’s a huge cemetery,” Siepert said. “That shouldn’t be forgotten.”

But for decades after the Allied victory in Europe — whose 75th anniversary is Friday — many of those who died there were indeed forgotten. Some were buried where they fell, while others were dragged by civilians in the months after the war into trenches and foxholes they had themselves dug, and were covered over.

For the last 15 years, volunteers like Siepert from around Europe have been trying to rectify that, devoting vacations to excavating long-buried trench lines and military positions in the search for those who never made it home.

During 19 digs on less than half a square mile of land, members of the Assn. for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe have found 116 German and 129 Soviet soldiers.

They seek to identify as many as possible — to provide closure for families, to give the dead their names back and to separate them from the numbers in the history books in the hope of explaining the cost of war to future generations.

“On all sides, these are destroyed lives. These are all people who died senselessly,” said Albrecht Laue, chairman of the association. “If we talk about a huge slaughter with hundreds of thousands of dead, nobody can understand that. But if I talk about the story of a young 17-year-old soldier, that’s tangible.”

Laue, a 46-year-old businessman from Hamburg, got interested in the search when looking for the grave of his grandfather, which he located near where he died fighting in Russia in 1942 as a young lieutenant.

Siepert, 47, an engineer from nearby Frankfurt an der Oder, remembers as a child having regular lectures in school about avoiding the grenades and other munitions still found in the area, and wondering why.

Other volunteers include anthropologists, archaeologists, excavators and the disposal experts needed when munitions are found. They hail from all over, including Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands.

“We couldn’t, and also don’t want to, look for soldiers from a specific nation,” Laue said. “That’s the interesting thing when one finds one of the dead; one never even knows at the beginning if it’s a German or a Soviet.”

In February 1945, they were bitter foes.

The village of Klessin sits on a height a little more than a mile from the Oder River. German military observers used it to call in artillery strikes on Soviet troops as they streamed across a pontoon bridge in the buildup before the final push on Berlin.

Recognizing the strategic importance of the hamlet 60 miles east of Berlin, the Soviets made it a target. The Nazis resolved to hold it, moving in a unit of soldiers, augmented by officer cadets and older “Volkssturm” militia, scraped up as the number of military-age men dwindled.

The fighting pitted 400 Germans in Klessin against about four times that number of Soviets, with the Germans supported by a unit of Panther tanks in the neighboring village of Podelzig, nearby artillery and air-dropped supplies.

Fierce combat raged for nearly two months, often hand-to-hand, as the Soviets attempted to take the village, firing off 62,000 mortar rounds and artillery shells.

Exactly how many were killed or listed as missing is not known, but the casualties were enormous, Siepert said.

“On March 20, German troops tried to break through there to make a corridor,” he said, pointing to a field between Klessin and Podelzig where the Soviets had laid a minefield and other defenses after encircling the village. “There were 150 missing from that single attack, as well as 50 killed. Seventy made it through.”

On March 23, 1945, the beleaguered German soldiers attempted a breakout under the cover of darkness. About 60 made it, and the others were captured or killed.

German tank commander Lt. Hans Eimer was listed as missing after the breakout attempt. Eimer had led his Panther tank into Klessin the week before on his 22nd birthday to support the garrison, but the vehicle ended up being knocked out, and he was wounded and trapped in the village.

Eimer’s younger brother, Fritz, had died in fighting that January. After the war, his sister, Margarete, had long urged Laue’s group to try to determine the fate of her only other sibling.

Eimer’s remains were located by Laue’s group in 2016 by chance and identified by dogtags. The group told Margarete before she died in 2018 that her brother had made it 250 yards out of the village before he was killed, and lay with two other soldiers.

Identifications are rare, especially of the Soviet soldiers who had no dogtags, but occasionally the volunteers get lucky.

In a dig on a Soviet outpost on a hill outside Klessin in 2018, they came across three Soviet soldiers who were all highly decorated and traced their names through the medals.

This year’s spring dig has been postponed because of lockdown restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. Some work is still underway on a memorial site being established amid the rubble of the original farm buildings.

Hermann Kaiser, a member of the small community association behind the memorial, said he remembered finding military materiel as a kid growing up in the area, happily throwing on an old steel helmet and fighting “war” with his friends, not understanding that they were playing on graves.

But not everyone follows all the rules all the time. That wasn’t happening before the current chaos, and judging from the crowded Orange County beaches, it certainly isn’t happening now. (Who knows? You might be flouting the guidelines as you read this, you unmasked person in a public place.)

It’s also more than likely that these transgressions — big or small — have filled you with shame.

No one will tell you to wear a mask or take your temperature or demand blood work before you hit the road this summer.

But questions abound about this American institution, including whether it’s safe — at least, safer than airline travel.

Here’s what your road trip of the future may look like.



Is driving safer than flying?

People are increasingly looking at car trips for their vacation plans, according to data from MMGY Travel Intelligence in partnership with the U.S. Travel Assn. In a survey taken April 17-22, 47% of respondents said they would be more likely to travel by car, an increase from 35% in data collected April 4-11.

For all travelers, safety is a priority, and many are asking whether driving is safer than flying these days.

In terms of the coronavirus, probably, said Dr. Robert Winters, a Southern California infectious disease specialist.

“If traveling with others in a car, one would assume you know the person that is sitting next to you and you know their health status,” Winters said in an email.

“Car travel has to be safer than airline travel when you factor in controlled boarding/exiting processes, number of people on the airplane, unknown health status of people on the flight, uncooperative children sitting near you, etc.”

In terms of crashes, planes are safer. In 2019, about 39,000 people died in automobile accidents, according to the National Safety Council. Airplane crashes caused 257 deaths that year, according to To70’s aviation review.



Before you leave

•Do your car’s regular pre-trip check — tires, especially — that AAA recommends, noting that getting stranded may have greater consequences because of reduced service.

•Check conditions at your destination to ensure that you’re not hitting a hot spot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a map that shows hot spots and provides data at bit.ly/coronavirushotspots

•Double-check whether the state you’re heading to has self-quarantine in effect. Although federal law cannot bar you from traveling to a state, local authorities can require self-quarantine for as long as 14 days. To check whether the state you’re planning to visit has such a regulation, call the state health authority from a list provided by the CDC: bit.ly/statehealthdepartments.

•Pack masks and gloves for all riders, Winters said, and make provisions for hand washing/sanitzer (BYOSS — bring your own soap and sanitizer). Disinfectant wipes are a must.

•Check in with your healthcare provider, AAA suggests, especially if your passengers are older or have medical issues.

•Pack a cooler with drinks and snacks, including high-protein goodies that will not go bad, to reduce the number of stops.

Advertisement

•Clean your car. About a third of drivers clean the inside of their car only about once a year, said Sheryl Connelly, a futurist who studies global consumer trends for Ford Motor Co., adding that the steering wheel is generally four times dirtier than a restroom. Besides that high-touch point, clean safety belts, door handles and even the fob you use to start the car. In the future, cars may have anti-microbial surfaces, she said. The CDC offers suggestions on how to sanitize your home, many of which are applicable to the car: bit.ly/CDCclisinfecting. (Bleach or cleaning solutions with bleaching agents should not be used on surfaces, such as carpeting, that are not colorfast.)

•Pack plenty of charging cords and perhaps external batteries for electronic devices. If your navigation system contains emergency calling, enable that as well, Connelly said.

•Plan like a demon. You don’t want to wing it, especially for hotels, restaurants or rest areas. And don’t rely on websites, said Bill Clevlen, a travel broadcaster and writer who travels to 50 or 60 destinations a year as he helps travelers “rediscover” America.

“If you’re planning on making a pit stop or two along your route, call ... to make sure the restaurant or rest area is actually going to be open,” he said in an email. “Some will have shut down for good or will have had hours change. This is particularly true in places that have relied solely on ‘travel traffic’ away from more populated areas.”

•Read the fine print. Understand the lodging’s cancellation rules. “Make sure the hotel or rental property you book has an iron-clad refund policy,” Clevlen said. “Major hotels seem to have been very reasonable, but still ask.” Booking directly with the hotel may spare you some back and forth with a third-party site if something goes wrong, he said.



And now, for some good news

In a year in which good news has been rare, here’s some: You’ll pay significantly less for gasoline. Small fluctuations in gas prices usually make little difference in your trip costs, but this year is an exception.

Advertisement

Let’s say you’re driving to San Francisco and back. You fill up in L.A. for the trip north at an average of $2.83 a gallon and in San Francisco at $2.99 a gallon for the trip home in a car that averages 30 mpg. This year, you’ll save more than $33 in gas, based on year-ago prices in both locations that topped $4 a gallon, according to the AAA Gas Prices report.

Will low prices continue? Definite maybe. Prices increased by a penny a gallon on May 1. As long as there is an oversupply of oil, as has been the case in recent weeks, your outlay for your miles on the L.A.-San Francisco trip may continue to total $75 or less.

One final, delicate topic: the rest stop

Calling ahead to be sure your favorite rest stop is open is a good idea. You’ll also want to take an occasional break and avoid driving drowsy, which accounted for more than 100,000 accidents in 2019, according to the National Safety Council. Further, the CDC notes that many thousands of Americans report “short sleep,” that is, getting less than seven hours a night.

If you look at the CDC’s map for California, it’s a wonder that Southern Californians can keep their eyes open: The stats show that people in L.A., Riverside and San Diego counties, among others, show the highest rate of sleep deprivation. Add to that the stress of recent events that’s keeping us awake, and it’s a formula for falling asleep at the wheel.

So by all means, stop. Pull over. Take a snooze. But before using the restroom, consider the grunge factors. You need a restroom with soap and hot water, two forceful combatants against the coronavirus.

Create a restroom break kit for each person traveling with you: small bars of soap, paper towels (for drying and avoiding high-touch handles), travel-size packs of toilet seat covers; include hand sanitizer and wipes for when soap and water are not available.

If you are at a gas station, consider the restroom break after you pump gas, and wash hands before and after. (If only pumping gas, gloves are a good idea. Dispose in the nearby trash containers, not on the ground.)

Overreacting? Possibly. But in this age of the coronavirus, we must act as though our life depends on the precautions we take.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/travel/story/2020-05-05/after-coronavirus-taking-car-road-trip
"['Audience Engagement Editor', 'Rachel Schnalzer Is An Audience Engagement Editor For The Los Angeles Times.']",2020-05-01,Is time flying by oddly quickly during COVID-19? Here’s why you may feel that way,"Think about your first day in quarantine. Does it feel like a lifetime ago? Or does it feel like yesterday?

Many people staying at home as a result of the coronavirus crisis are noticing time pass more strangely than usual. While some complain of days dragging on and on, others have taken to social media, explaining they feel the past several weeks have flown by eerily quickly.

Wow idk if it’s just me or what but time feels like it’s going fast while in quarantine. Weird. I swear I’m not going insane... yet. 😆😂 — K.G. (@heyitskriz) April 16, 2020

Turns out, science can provide some insight into why our perception of time is a little wonkier than normal while in quarantine. Here’s what the experts say:

Advertisement

Why do some feel as though time is passing unnaturally quickly?

“Time does seem to be going really fast,” agrees Claudia Hammond, author of “Time Warped: Unlocking the Mysteries of Time Perception,” noting that it’s our perception of time that feels unusual, separate from the way time actually works. In our minds, “time can warp very easily,” she says. But why does this happen?

For those staying at home during the pandemic, it has a lot to do with our worlds shrinking to the bare minimum — staying at home for the vast majority of the day, with trips outside only for exercise or a visit to the grocery store. For the most part, we are not taking part in particularly memorable activities, like getting drinks with a friend, going to a sporting event or traveling, says Marc Wittmann, an author and research fellow at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg, Germany. Now, there are fewer signals differentiating a Sunday from a Monday.

Is it just me or is time flying by unreasonably and psychotically fast every day? YOU’D THINK IT’D BE THE OPPOSITE what’s happening 🕑🕒🕓🕔🕕🕖🕗🕘🕙🕚🕛🕜🤡 — K A C E Y (@KaceyMusgraves) April 18, 2020

And if you’re doing the same thing every day — the new normal for many in quarantine — there’s no need to remember each day specifically. Even if time passes slowly in the moment, it’s likely that nothing will stand out upon looking back, causing you to perceive time has passed by quickly in the long run, Wittmann explains.

“The more emotional a memory, the longer perception of time duration.” This is why a weekend vacation will often feel longer than a weekend spent at home. And right now, many in quarantine are experiencing the opposite of a vacation, Hammond notes. “We’re not making loads of new memories now, so we don’t think lots of time has passed.”

James Broadway, an instructor of psychology at Lincoln Land Community College in Illinois, who has studied the brain’s perception of time, notes a similar phenomenon occurs when we age. The older we get, the fewer novel events we experience, which causes time to feel as if it’s going by faster than it did earlier in our lives. Hammond points out that a similar phenomenon can happen to people who are sick or incarcerated. Time will pass slowly as it’s experienced but then feel as if it’s gone by quickly in retrospect.

However, if you’ve felt as though time has taken a long time to pass during the pandemic, even retrospectively, you’re not alone. Adrian Bejan, a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke University, believes it’s possible the novelty of the quarantine experience could actually explain why weeks may feel like they’re dragging to some.

“The brain remembers the unusual,” he explains, and if our new routines are suddenly different, our brains would be bombarded with images worth remembering. This would then result in the perception that time is moving slowly over the quarantine experience, though it’s likely time will feel as though it’s speeding up again as the quarantine becomes more familiar.

It’s also important to note not everyone has the relative luxury of feeling bored at home while in quarantine. Many people are busier than ever, whether they’re working in a hospital on the front lines of the coronavirus or at home balancing a full work schedule while trying to home-school their children. It’s possible people who are busier than ever during the coronavirus crisis will look back and feel as though this period of their lives lasted longer than normal, Hammond suggests. “When they look back, it will be the other way around,” she says.

What can we do about it?

Our altered perspective of time can be useful during quarantine. Normally, when we’re bored, we have a plethora of options in front of us, like going to the gym or meeting up with friends. Now, we’re being challenged to spend time alone or with others in our household. “This could be a chance to learn how to cope with boredom and isolation,” Wittmann explains. “Learn to be at ease with being with yourself.”

If you’re feeling anxious and have difficulty coping with being alone, it’s helpful to have a goal, he says. Whether you’re aiming to exercise more or clean your apartment regularly, having a physical task to complete may help assuage feelings of stress and take your focus off the passage of time. This is a rare occasion in which you can take advantage of having more time at your disposal to do new things, Bejan says. If you’ve always wanted to take time to paint, read more books or accomplish other quarantine-friendly activities, now could be the moment.

Finding events to look forward to can be similarly helpful in passing the time, Hammond notes. Though we can’t look forward to vacations or physical outings with friends, she suggests re-creating the feeling of having plans by scheduling a virtual happy hour on Friday night or creating a Sunday afternoon film club, which you’re able to look forward to all week long. “Make the weekends different from the weekdays,” recommends Hammond.

Meditation may also be soothing for those suffering from anxiety in quarantine, Broadway suggests, saying, “It’s a really good opportunity to embrace doing nothing.” If all else fails, Bejan suggests those in quarantine “get into the habit of looking at things you were previously overlooking.” Focus on minute details — the way the trees look on your street, the way the steam floats off your tea. After a few minutes of taking your mind off the passage of time, you might be surprised to find time has a funny way of speeding up after all.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-05-01/does-it-feel-like-like-time-is-flying-by-during-coronavirus-quarantine-heres-why

If you haven’t been thinking much about climate change recently, I don’t blame you. There’s a lot of other stuff going on. But we can’t completely forget about it, either.

Even with much of the economy on lockdown, we’re still burning fossil fuels, and global temperatures are still rising. This year is shaping up to be one of the hottest on record, according to researchers at Carbon Brief, a climate science website. Drought conditions in Northern California may prompt an early start to the 2020 wildfire season — and as Californians have learned in recent years, climate change is fueling more devastating droughts and fires.

So what does this have to do with the COVID-19 pandemic? A lot, actually.

Research has found that Americans living in areas with worse air pollution — caused largely by the burning of fossil fuels — are at greater risk of dying from COVID-19 . Across the U.S., public health experts are warning that the death toll from summer heat waves could rise as millions of people self-isolate in homes they can’t keep cool. There are also economic implications, including more than 100,000 job losses in the clean energy sector and the worst oil bust in a lifetime, with prices briefly falling below zero .

The pandemic may also create new opportunities to confront climate change. Public investment in the clean energy sector, for instance, is one option for policymakers looking to rebuild the battered economy after the pandemic is over.

I asked experts what lessons from the coronavirus response might apply to climate change. Their answers included creating a health and economic safety net for communities affected by pollution, offering financial support for fossil fuel workers who lose their jobs and perhaps a renewed willingness to change our lifestyles to help others.

Across California

With Gov. Gavin Newsom announcing that some stores could open with restrictions by the end of the week as the state enters Phase Two of his plan to relax stay-at-home orders, California communities are considering what to do next.

Rural, less populated regions may reopen faster than harder-hit urban areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco. The number of infections in some rural and suburban counties is dramatically lower, with four counties having seen no cases at all, and more than a dozen reporting no deaths from the illness. Newsom on Tuesday criticized Sutter and Yuba counties for letting businesses reopen Monday against state orders as officials there argued that they were less affected. “They’re making a big mistake. They’re putting their public at risk. They’re putting our progress at risk,” Newsom said. He did not say if the state would take any action to enforce the stay-at-home order and other statewide restrictions in those counties.

L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that he did not expect retail businesses to be able to offer curbside delivery by Friday. The city’s Safer at Home order remains in effect until May 15, and Garcetti said he hoped steps restricting commerce could begin to be rolled back by then.

More Orange County beaches have been granted permission to reopen with limitations, after Newsom closed them last week to prevent weekend crowding. Under plans approved by state officials, the cities of Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Seal Beach can now open up access to their shorelines, with a range of measures to ensure safe physical distancing.

The pandemic has effectively brought much of Walt Disney Co., the world’s largest entertainment company and one of California’s biggest private employers, to a halt. Until recently, it was riding high on its dominant box office performance, packed themed parks and a fast-growing new streaming service. But Disney now says its parks segment missed out on about $1 billion in operating income in the second quarter due to coronavirus closures.

The shuttered parks could have serious implications for California’s economy because of the number of people temporarily out of work and the amount of economic activity the parks attract to the area. There are also questions about what Disney will look like when the outbreak subsides. Executive Chairman Bob Iger doesn’t “think we’re ever going to see a return to business as usual.”

Around the nation and the world

Top Trump administration health officials repeatedly ignored warnings in January and February about the need for masks and other protective equipment to prepare for the coronavirus outbreak, according to a detailed whistleblower complaint from a senior scientist ousted from his post last month. The scientist also said his skepticism about hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug touted by President Trump as a COVID-19 treatment, angered senior administration officials.

Public health officials are using antibody tests to get a more accurate picture of the virus’ spread, but businesses are also beginning to seek them out in order to bring people back to work. The tests have been touted as a way to give people so-called “immunity passports” that would allow them to work without the risk that they are contagious. But the reality is that the tests aren’t readily available, can be inaccurate and don’t tell us how much protection antibodies even provide — or for how long.

While trust in governments around the world is rising, trust in businesses — and their leaders in particular — has fallen sharply during the pandemic, according to a new report by communications firm Edelman. The survey reflects agitation among low-wage workers, including grocery store employees and delivery workers, who see too few safety protections and say their pay isn’t in line with the risk they face. “Businesses actually haven’t performed well in the minds of respondents. There’s a feeling they haven’t gotten the right products and they haven’t protected their employees — that profits are still being put over people, and more should be done to prepare for the next phase,” said Edelman’s chief executive.

As hospitals in Mexico become overloaded with patients, families are losing patience with long wait times for care and a lack of communication from medical officials. Tales of hospitals mixing up bodies have circulated on social media, leading relatives to demand to see the corpses of their loved ones to ensure they’re identified correctly. “We wanted to be sure it was my brother,” said the sister of a patient who died of COVID-19 the day after she and her family brought him to the hospital.



Your questions answered

Today’s question comes from Joseph Rys, who wants to know: Do our cars need to be disinfected? Travel editor Catharine Hamm looked into it as part of a story about what our future road trips might look like.

In order to make your car as safe as possible — whether or not you’re traveling — you should clean it. About a third of drivers clean the inside of their car only about once a year, said a futurist at Ford Motor Co. She added that the steering wheel is generally four times dirtier than a restroom.

The suggestions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers for cleaning your home can also be applied to your vehicle. Besides the steering wheel, focus on disinfecting high-touch surfaces like safety belts, door handles and even the fob you use to start the car.

Escalate the frequency of your checks on tires, oil and any equipment that could leave you stranded if it fails. That way you’re not dependent on outside rescue, which might be a vector for virus transmission. It’s also a good idea to keep a supply of masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes at the ready. Remember, the virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets and can last for hours to days on some surfaces.

"['Staff Writer', 'Kevin Baxter Covers Soccer For The Los Angeles Times', 'Where He Has Worked For Years.']",2020-05-05,Soccer newsletter: A settlement is best in U.S. women’s soccer pay dispute,"Hello, and welcome to another edition of the L.A. Times soccer newsletter. I’m Kevin Baxter, The Times’ soccer writer, and we’ll start today with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which won a partial victory over the women’s national team in a court of law last week but it is still getting routed in the court of public opinion.

Last Friday U.S. District Court Judge R. Gary Klausner dismissed a large part of the women’s gender-equality lawsuit, dealing a mortal blow to the team’s claim it was owned more than $66 million in damages and back pay. But that doesn’t change the fact that, for many, the reigning Women’s World Cup champions are at least underappreciated, if not underpaid, when compared to a men’s national team that didn’t even qualify for its last World Cup and has gone beyond the round of 16 just once since 1930.

Newsletter All about the beautiful game Go inside the L.A. pro soccer scene and beyond in Kevin Baxter's weekly newsletter. Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.

So the wisest move for the federation now is to avoid spiking the football – what does it really have to celebrate anyway? – and instead approach the women with a peace offer that redresses their grievances and allows both sides to move forward together.

Fortunately in Cindy Parlow Cone, who is less than two months into her job as federation president, it has the perfect person to make that happen. And that makes an out-of-court settlement the best solution for both sides, providing it’s one that gives the women’s team a much bigger role in the federation’s business going forward, rewards them for their accomplishments and recognizes the outsized role the women’s game will have in growing soccer globally in the coming years.

Cone has been here before. She played on the 1999 World Cup-champion U.S. squad, a team that challenged U.S. Soccer with its own fight for respect and equality. Five months after winning the world title on Brandi Chastain’s penalty kick before a sold-out crowd at the Rose Bowl, the 99ers went on strike, refusing to play until the federation agreed to a collective-bargaining agreement to replace the one which expired before the World Cup victory.

Enjoying this newsletter? Consider subscribing to the Los Angeles Times Become a subscriber. Your support helps us deliver the news that matters most.

Cone and her teammates were asking for an $1,850 raise, to $5,000 a month; the women today are asking to be paid on par with the men’s national team, whose players can make as much as $17,625 a game depending on the opponent and the outcome. That’s nearly double the bonus a woman player would get for a comparable result.

Advertisement

But while the numbers have changed since 1999, the argument is the same: the women aren’t getting the reward or the recognition they have earned.

Klausner didn’t opine on that, sticking instead to the legal arguments when agreeing with the federation that the collective-bargaining agreement the women negotiated in 2017 paid them more in guaranteed salary and benefits than the men get. The lawyers representing the women have promised to appeal and although the judge did allow claims of disparities in travel and medical staff to go to trial June 16 in Los Angeles, with the main argument seemingly off the table, the best way forward for both sides would be to strike a deal.

“The WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote in a 32-page opinion.

And he’s right; the women’s lawsuit was based on faulty math all along. Although it is true a male player can earn more in bonuses for one game, the women’s CBA guarantees a base salary of as much as $100,000 a year plus another $72,500 for playing in the National Women’s Soccer League, the domestic league that U.S. Soccer subsidizes. That means the federation pays the top 18 players in the national team pool $172,500, plus benefits such as medical insurance and family leave, in addition to game-day bonuses.

Advertisement

The men get no guaranteed salary and no benefits and must make a game-day squad to get any pay at all. But as was the case two decades ago with Cone and the 99ers, the dispute between the team and the federation is only partly about money. That the new president gets that was obvious in the carefully-worded two-sentence statement the federation released after Klausner’s decision.

“We look forward to working with the Women’s National Team to chart a positive path forward to grow the game both here at home and around the world,” it said. “U.S. Soccer has long been the world leader for the women’s game on and off the field, and we are committed to continuing that work to ensure our Women’s National Team remains the best in the world and sets the standard for women’s soccer.”

Contrast that with the language used in the federation’s legal filings two months ago when it argued that male players need “materially more strength and speed” than women players and the job of male players “carried more than responsibility” than playing for the most decorated women’s national team in history.

That’s not the way to address the most decorated national team in women’s soccer history and one of the most accomplished in all of international sports.

It was a disaster that led federation president Carlos Cordeiro to resign, paving the way for Cone to become the first women to lead U.S. Soccer in the federation’s 107 years and her accension couldn’t have come at a better time. Not only has she been a victim of the federation’s unequal practices, she was also part of a team that fought against them, which gives her a visceral understanding the issues at play and the credibility to solve them.

Despite her federation’s win in court Cone knows the arc of justice bends toward the women, who clearly have the public on their side. Jersey sales, TV ratings and attendance for the women eclipse the men across the board. Of more importance for U.S. Soccer’s bottom line is the fact major sponsors, including Coca-Cola Co., Anheuser Busch, Procter & Gamble and Volkswagen have also rallied to the women’s side.

Last year U.S. Soccer offered the women $9 million to settle their lawsuit; the players want more than $66 million. That’s a big gap to bridge but the women themselves have hinted at a way forward, publicly conceding that equal pay is a complex concept. That’s an argument with which Cone undoubtedly agrees and it gives the sides a starting point to begin a new way forward.

The players have said repeatedly they are fighting for future generations so what if the women’s national team was offered increased representation on the U.S. Soccer board of governors? What if they were given enough seats at the decision-making table to ensure real progress is made not only on the national level but in youth development and in spending at all levels?

What if U.S. Soccer adopted a platform that included pressuring FIFA to address global inequalities in soccer? Fifty-one FIFA members don’t even field a women’s team and the vast, vast majority of those that do spend very little on their women’s program. What if U.S. pledged to pressure FIFA to change that, requiring all members to support women’s soccer and fund it at a baseline level?

When France won the men’s World Cup in 2018 it took home $38 million from a total prize-money purse of $400 million. When the U.S. won the Women’s World Cup last summer it got $4 million from a total purse of $30 million. FIFA must change that too and if the argument is the men’s tournament brings in more money – which it does – then move some of that revenue over to fund the women’s competition.

That kind of revenue sharing has made Title IX work and the growth that has meant to women’s programs has greatly benefited all college sports, regardless of gender.

It would work for FIFA as well. If FIFA can be persuaded to engage half the planet’s population instead of marginalizing it, it might be surprised how much the global game can still grow.

Last week’s court ruling shouldn’t be seen as a loss for the women’s team nor as a win for the federation. Instead it represents an opportunity for both sides to get beyond the animosity that has built up since Cone’s playing days, paving the way for Cone the president to usher in the kind of advances she and her teammates must have envisioned when they went on strike two decades ago.

Is opening of training facilities the start of an MLS return?

MLS will allow players to access team training facilities Wednesday for the first time since March 13, although there are more caveats and restrictions to that reopening than there is in the fine print of a mobile-phone contract.

Players must train alone, outdoors, in a predesignated quadrant of the training field, for example. They cannot use locker rooms, team gyms, restrooms and other facilities. The workouts are considered voluntary and they cannot conflict with local public health or government restrictions.

Additionally, teams must submit a specific plan to the league explaining how they will sanitize and disinfect all equipment after each session, how they will screen players for COVID-19 as well as how they will stagger player and staff arrivals and departures to allow social-distancing measures to be enforced. Players must also dress at home and wear personal protective gear on their walks to and from the training field.

Yet despite all that, this probably represents an unsteady first step back toward some semblance of normalcy.

A day after suspending its season in early March, MLS placed a moratorium on the use of team facilities, exempting only players who required specific treatment for an injury. That moratorium has been extended five times through May 15. And while practice sessions of two or more players remain prohibited, the league made a commonsense call to open practice fields in controlled conditions amid growing concerns that players were endangering themselves training in parks and other public venues where there were limited safeguards against the spread of COVID-19.

So I’m going to be optimistic here and say the unlocking of training facilities – even under draconian restrictions – is a sign of progress.

The league, after all, is still hopeful of completing a full 34-game schedule, even if that means playing the 2020 MLS Cup final early next year. One option discussed would have teams return to play in empty stadiums, but that would be costly since the league says ticket revenue, along with corporate sponsorships, is its largest source of revenue.

Exactly what the next step is isn’t clear, even to the players.

“I just don’t think it’s that easy, really,” Galaxy defender Daniel Steres said during an appearance on the Corner of the Galaxy podcast last week. “Even trying to do a closed-door thing, you have to go to a single location and wherever that may be, there can’t be more spread of the virus there.

“Then you have to put us in a hotel that’s got to be essentially locked down. You can’t have any touch with the outside world. That’s nearly impossible.”

Steres said he’s trying to remain optimistic about the possibility of restarting the season soon, but he’s pessimistic about exactly how that would happen. California, he noted, remains under lockdown while other states with MLS teams, such as Florida, Georgia and Texas, have reopened. And once games resume, what would happen if players test positive? Would teams have to play with smaller rosters, perhaps without designated players, or would the schedule be paused again?

“I want to get back to playing. I want to get back to training. It’s just tough for me to see an easy or good way to do it,” he said. “That you can just, as a fan or anyone, be like ‘yeah, let’s just do that’; I think they’re kind of racking their brains for anything they can possibility come up with at this point.”

Whatever the solution, Steres said it’s unlikely to satisfy everybody. So even if MLS is able to crown a champion for its 25th anniversary season, it will always carry an asterisk.

“Any team [that] gets to the end of the road, the other teams might be looking at them like ‘ah, it was 2020. It was that year’,” he said.

Assuming MLS resumes play at some point, the pause in the schedule might actually work to Steres’ benefit. After leading the Galaxy in minutes played in two of the last four seasons, the defender sat out the first two games this year with a groin injury. The break has helped that heal.

“That’s been my main focus during this quarantine time,” he said. “I can’t sit here and say just resting has completely gotten rid of everything, which is a little unfortunate. But we’re getting there, we’re getting close.”

So, perhaps, is MLS.

European leagues also stuck for COVID-19 response

MLS isn’t the only first-division league struggling to find a way forward during the coronavirus pandemic. In the last week Belgium, France and Argentina joined the Netherlands in deciding to shut down their seasons while major decisions still loom in Germany, England, Spain and Italy.

After the U.S., Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Belgium and Germany rank second through seventh in terms of reported COVID-19 fatalities, combing for nearly half the deaths worldwide. So authorities there have more than soccer to consider when it comes to reopening stadiums.

The French ruled against the resumption of fun and games last week, blocking plans for the country’s top two men’s leagues and its top women’s league to restart play. Paris Saint-Germain, which led second-place Marseille by 12 points with 11 games to play, was declared the Ligue 1 champion and with the rest of the standings also frozen in place, Frank McCourt’s Marseille, in second place, qualifies for the Champions League for the first time since 2013-14 while Rennes and Lille get the league’s other two European tournament spots.

At the bottom of the table last-place Toulouse and 19th-place Amiens were relegated while second-division leader Lorient and second-place Lens were promoted.

In Argentina, Boca Juniors were declared champions over Buenos Aires rival River Plate after the season’s final 11 games were canceled.

The Bundesliga, meanwhile, was hopeful of restarting its season May 9 but that date was pushed back when the German government delayed action on approving the league’s request to resume play until later this week. Chancellor Angela Merkel began easing lockdown measures across the country in late April only to be met by concerns over a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, leading some health experts to question the return to soccer.

Complicating matters further was the announcement that two players and a trainer at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus.

In England the government and Premier League officials are discussing ways to restart the EPL season in June and the play the final 92 games on the schedule, most likely at neutral sites behind locked doors. But after a 3 ½-hour video conference between team representatives Friday, the Guardian reported at least one participant came away feeling the obstacles the league was facing were too great to overcome. Discussions will continue this week; the league is facing as much as $1.25 billion in lost revenue if the season does not resume, according to chief executive Richard Masters.

In Spain, the government has approved a protocol for sporting activity to resume and teams began testing players for COVID-19 on Tuesday in the hopes of resuming training sessions next week. The league wants to restart the La Liga season in mid-June.

In Italy, Serie A clubs were expected to resume training this week after voting in a conference call to resume the season, perhaps as early as next month, They, too, will need government approval before games can be held.

In Portugal clubs returned to the training fields Monday with the government’s blessing for the first time in nearly two months. The Primeira Liga is scheduled to restart on May 30.

Amid growing pressure to ease a stay-at-home order that has cratered the California economy, Gov. Gavin Newsom took to the podium for his daily briefing on Monday and made a major announcement: The state will begin “reopening” this week, with some retail stores getting back to business as early as Friday, albeit with modifications.

But before you hire that celebratory marching band, remember that reopening the nation’s most populous state will be a slow process. Californians can expect change to happen incrementally over a series of months, following a four-stage blueprint for easing restrictions that the governor laid out last week.

What’s happening this week

Bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and others will be eligible to reopen for pickup beginning Friday, provided that the businesses make modifications to meet state guidelines. Manufacturing and logistics for the retail supply chain will also be able to resume.

How all of this fits into the broader plan

Think of each stage of Newsom’s plan as a stretch of highway with various landmarks along the way, rather than a single discrete destination. The state will begin moving into the second phase of the four-stage plan this week, but not all aspects will happen at once. Shopping malls, dine-in restaurants and offices where telework is possible have also been categorized as part of Stage 2, but they will reopen later. Officials have also said that restrictions will be continually assessed and could be modified based on regional health conditions, including testing capabilities.

What else you need to know

Rural Californians who’ve been agitating for a faster timetable for loosening restrictions in their communities (or, in some cases, defying those restrictions altogether) will probably welcome the other major announcement from Monday’s briefing. Newsom said that he would allow for regional variation as the plan moves forward, with expanded decision-making at the local level. Some communities will be able to move further ahead into the second phase of the reopening process at their own pace and open more businesses — such as restaurant dining rooms — beyond those outlined in the statewide policy. But if communities want to take that next step, counties must first submit “containment plans” that meet certain requirements for hospital beds, testing kits and the ability to track infected people and trace their contacts.

And now, here’s what’s happening across California:

Amid an outbreak at one of its stores in Southern California, the largest U.S. grocery chain has announced it will provide free coronavirus testing for all its frontline associates who have symptoms or medical needs that make them eligible for testing under guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kroger, which operates multiple supermarket chains, including Kroger, Ralphs and Food4Less, said it will begin offering the testing this month through its healthcare division, Kroger Health. The announcement comes as an outbreak at a Ralphs in Hollywood marks the largest cluster of infections at a retail store recorded by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Twenty-one employees of the Sunset Boulevard grocery store’s 158 employees have tested positive for the virus. Los Angeles Times

AND FINALLY

Today’s California memory comes from Kathleen Harrison:

I was raised on Catalina Island in the 1950s. All our parents served the summer tourism that kept us afloat, but from Labor Day to Memorial Day the island was ours. Despite summertime joys, quiet winters felt more magical. In a golden era for kids, we had freedom to roam, both in and out of the ocean, then we started working too. I’ve returned lifelong, to ‘skin dive’ the undersea gardens and hike the hills. Even in our 70s, old islanders gather there to savor our shared memories, the scent of the chaparral, the unique light and our island’s spirit.

La señora de tan solo 35 años de edad, ha pasado más de un mes con la enfermedad de COVID19 y aún sigue delicada de salud y sin poder acercarse a sus hijos.

Aída y su esposo Jorge fueron diagnosticados el pasado 29 de marzo. Ambos residentes de Lincoln Heights empezaron a sentir al mismo tiempo los síntomas principales de la enfermedad: tos, dolor de cuerpo y fiebre.

Anuncio

Bastó una llamada por teléfono a su doctor para que este le dijera a la madre que ella y su esposo tenían que aislarse de inmediato porque tenían coronavirus.

El aislamiento significaría que su hija Leidy, de 20 años de edad, y quien trabaja como cajera en la cadena de tiendas Superior, tendría que hacerse cargo del resto de sus hermanitos de 14, 13, 2 años y un bebé de cinco meses de edad.

El pánico se apoderó de Aída, así como de Jorge, pero la travesía con la nueva enfermedad fue diferente para los dos. Su esposo recobró la salud a los 15 días de enfermarse e incluso pudo regresar a trabajar en una imprenta, pero ella siguió débil al punto de tomar el teléfono y despedirse a través de un texto.

Anuncio

Sin poder recuperarse, la señora decidió hacerse la prueba el 17 de abril, y dos días después le dijeron que su doctor de cabecera estaba en lo correcto. Ella resultó positiva para el coronavirus.

Hasta hoy en día, Aída sigue con lo síntomas, ya no tan fuertes como antes, pero el pensamiento de poder morir merodea su cabeza, al mismo tiempo que su voz interna le dice que tiene que ser fuerte para sus hijos.

Cuando la Organización Mundial de la Salud declaró el coronavirus como una pandemia, ella se apresuró a abastecerme de alimento para sus hijos. Ya para entonces muchas tiendas estaban vacías así que iba a diferentes y agarraba lo que podía, dice la señora.

“No supimos cómo nos contagiamos, pero mientras mi esposo tenía los síntomas leves, a mí me atacó a la enfermedad por completo”, sostiene.

Anuncio

La oriunda de México experimentó diarrea, escalofríos, náuseas, congestión en el pecho y la nariz los primeros 12 días. Sin embargo, el dolor de pecho y cuerpo eran tan extremos que llegó el momento en que no podía ni siquiera moverse o hablar. Su única opción era respirar por la boca.

“Hubo momentos en que era tanto el dolor y la falta de aire que quería llamarle a una ambulancia, pero me quedaba pensando en mis hijos… y pensaba que, si llegaba al hospital, ya no iba a salir de ahí”, dice Aída.

En una ocasión, sin poder hablar o sentir brazos y piernas, Aída tomó la decisión de despedirse, pero sin alarmar a su hija mas grande.

Anuncio

“Cogí el teléfono, eran las 3 de la mañana y le escribí a mi hija un texto… le dije: ‘necesito que seas fuerte porque no puedo respirar, tus hermanos te necesitan y quiero que los cuides si tengo que irme’…”, dice Aída.

La madre de familia sostiene que estaba consciente de que uno de sus hijos de 14 años sufre de ansiedad, y verla enferma y quejándose era peor para él.

“Entonces tomaba fuerzas para no terminar en el hospital. Luego pensaba en el cargo que le iba a dejar a mi hija mas grande, y enseguida se venían mis hijos más pequeños a la cabeza”, dice Aída. “Al final de cuentas todos ellos necesitan una madre”.

Durante todo este tiempo, Leydi, la hija mayor de Aída dejó de trabajar y estuvo a cargo de cuidar a su madre y hermanos más pequeños mientras el padre salía a trabajar.

“Aprendí ha hacer de comer por medio de YouTube y también aprendí a cambiar pañales y bañar a mi hermanito mas chico”, dice la joven entre sonrisas.

“Esta experiencia ha sido dura para mi familia. Hemos visto como mis padres han sufrido, en especial mi mamá, pero sabemos que muchas familias están experimentando lo mismo que nosotros. Lo único que quiero es que mi mamá este bien de salud”, dice la joven.

Aída por su parte le agradece a su hija lo que ha hecho por la familia entera y enfatiza que sus hijos le están salvando la vida.

“Uno debe de agarrar fuerzas y tener fe en Dios en que las cosas van a estar bien a pesar de los malos pensamientos que puedan venir con esto. He aprendido más que nunca que la familia es lo más importante”, dice Aída.

Consciente de los problemas monetarios que la familia enfrenta, Aida sostiene que ahora lo mas importante para ella es sanar para poder cuidar de sus hijos de nuevo, un regalo que espera ansiosa.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/espanol/california/articulo/2020-05-05/madre-de-cinco-con-coronavirus-se-despidio-por-texto-ahora-quiere-la-vida-como-regalo-de-dia-de-madres

He Also Appears Daily On Ktla Channel His Work Runs In Newspapers Across The Country', 'Has Resulted In A Variety Of Laws Protecting Consumers.']",2020-05-05,Column: What do you do if a business furloughs everyone you need to speak with?,"Nobody likes dealing with problems in their credit files. It can be a lengthy, laborious process involving lots of documents and calls to multiple companies and credit agencies.

That situation may now be even worse thanks to coronavirus business closures.

Carol Scott, 70, discovered this after recently attempting to resolve an “adverse report” placed on one of her credit files by Macy’s over an accidentally late payment.

The Sherman Oaks lawyer said the issue came to light as she was seeking a small-business loan to keep her practice afloat. The adverse report from Macy’s branded her a credit risk, prompting lenders to halt her loan applications.

Scott told me she had to make repeated calls to Macy’s before she finally reached a supervisor who would address the issue.

“The supervisor said there was nothing they could do,” she recalled. “She said they’d furloughed the entire dispute-resolution department and I’d have to wait until it reopened, maybe in May, maybe later.”

Which is to say, too bad about your credit file, but you’re on your own.

OK, a couple of thoughts immediately come to mind.

First, Macy’s is by no means alone in temporarily (or permanently) telling employees not to report for work. Many businesses have resorted to similar measures to help weather the coronavirus storm.

Second, what do Macy’s and other consumer-focused companies expect customers to do when troubles such as this arise?

“There is no excuse for harming people’s credit standing in these uncertain financial times,” said Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group Consumer Action.

I asked Macy’s about Scott’s situation. The company responded with a brief, two-sentence statement. I’ll get back to that.

Advertisement

Macy’s announced at the end of March that it was furloughing most of its 125,000 employees because of the pandemic, which had forced it to close all of its 775 stores.

The company said it was “moving to the absolute minimum workforce needed to maintain basic operations. This means the majority of our colleagues will go on furlough.”

Similar moves were announced by Nordstrom, JCPenney, Kohl’s, Gap, Best Buy and other prominent retailers.

Macy’s said last week that it plans to gradually reopen its stores over the next six to eight weeks.

Advertisement

All retailers are anxious to turn things around. Stay-at-home orders nationwide resulted in an 8.7% drop in March retail sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . That’s the biggest monthly decline ever recorded.

On Monday, preppy-clothes maven J. Crew filed for bankruptcy protection — the first major retailer to do so since the pandemic erupted.

“March was a month that started out with many stores still open, but far more are closed now,” said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. “Don’t be surprised if the data going forward show a worsening situation.”

Even so, business continues. Most retailers are still operating online, which means they’re still processing credit card payments and monthly bills.

Advertisement

Which means issues can arise if something goes wrong.

Yet Scott said she hit a brick wall while seeking help from Macy’s in addressing her snafu, which involved a Macy’s store card.

“They kept saying there was nothing they could do while everyone was furloughed,” she told me. “They couldn’t even say which government agencies I should turn to.”

That would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, both of which are charged with making sure consumers aren’t taken advantage of in their financial dealings.

Advertisement

I reached out to the two agencies. The CFPB didn’t respond (wake up, guys!), but a spokeswoman for the FTC said consumers can turn to the commission for information on disputing errors in credit files and to lodge a complaint.

I also contacted the three leading credit bureaus — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — for advice on what consumers should do if a business can’t or won’t step up to help resolve a dispute.

“Consumers can request a current copy of their credit reports from each of the national credit reporting companies for free,” said Sandra Bernardo, an Experian spokeswoman. “Doing so will enable consumers to verify their accounts and any activity, such as late payments, reported by their lenders.”

Each credit bureau has its own system for disputing problems, she said. Typically, such matters can be taken up online.

Advertisement

In Scott’s case, Bernardo said, “the consumer needs to check her Experian credit report, and if there is a late payment reported by Macy’s, she can initiate a dispute.”

But that’s just the start.

“It’s important to remember that disputing information with one credit bureau may not impact information on credit reports from the other two bureaus,” said Zehra Mehdi-Barlas, an Equifax spokeswoman.

So what did Macy’s have to say? A spokesperson said by email that “we are working with our customers to address their individual situations,” which suggests Scott isn’t the only one facing difficulties.

“If a customer has a question specifically on credit reporting, we instruct them to write to a monitored address — this team is not furloughed and is actively reviewing cases,” the spokesperson said.

I replied that Scott said she spoke with multiple Macy’s service reps, and not one instructed her to reach the unfurloughed team via a “monitored” email address.

“As it relates to this case, we apologize for any confusion,” the spokesperson wrote back. “We have increased awareness of this matter to support our agents and improve [the] customer experience.”

I asked why Macy’s is reporting late payments to credit agencies during a public health crisis. No answer.

I asked for the monitored email address so I could share it with other customers. No reply.

Weirdest of all, the spokesperson didn’t request Scott’s name or contact information. The company, apparently, wasn’t interested in pursuing the matter.

“If Macy’s still has the staff capacity to sell products online and place adverse reports on consumers’ credit files, then they should also have the staff capacity to handle disputes, too,” said Emily Rusch, executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05,Prosecutor: Grand jury to weigh charges in Georgia shooting of black man by two white men,"A Georgia prosecutor said Tuesday that he wants a grand jury to decide whether criminal charges are warranted in the death of a man shot after a pursuit by armed men who later told police they suspected him of being a burglar.

Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was killed Feb. 23 in a neighborhood outside the coastal port city of Brunswick. No one has been arrested or charged in the case, prompting an outcry from the local NAACP and others. Arbery was black and the men who chased him are white.

“All I want to do is get justice for my son,” said Marcus Arbery, the slain man’s father, who believes his son was out jogging when he was killed. “This is terrible. It could happen to anybody’s kid.”

The announcement that a grand jury will review the case came as an attorney for Arbery’s mother posted a cellphone video on Twitter that he said shows the shooting. “This is murder,” lawyer Lee Merritt said.

“Mr. Arbery had not committed any crime and there was no reason for these men to believe they had the right to stop him with weapons or to use deadly force in furtherance of their unlawful attempted stop,” said a statement by Merritt, who represents Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper.

Tom Durden, an outside prosecutor assigned to examine the case, said he plans to have a grand jury hear the evidence in the shooting. That won’t happen for more than a month, as Georgia courts remain largely closed because of the coronavirus outbreak until at least June 13.

“I am of the opinion that the case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges against those involved in the death of Mr. Arbery,” Durden said in a statement Tuesday.

Reached by phone, Durden said no arrests have been made in connection with the shooting. He declined to say what charges he would have a grand jury consider.

The cellphone video, initially posted by a Brunswick radio station, shows a black man running at a jogging pace on the left side of a two-lane road. A truck is parked in the road ahead of him, with one man in the pickup bed and another standing beside the open driver’s side door.

The runner crosses the road to pass the pickup on the passenger side, then crosses back in front of the truck. A gunshot sounds, and the video shows the runner grappling with a man in the street over what appears to be a shotgun or rifle. A second shot can be heard and the runner can be seen punching the man. A third shot is fired at point-blank range. The runner staggers a few feet and falls face down.

“I think the video is very clear that they were on the truck with guns hunting him down,” said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Arbery’s father. “I don’t know what more you need to make an arrest.”

Durden declined to comment Tuesday when the prosecutor was asked whether he could verify that the video showed the shooting of Arbery.

According to an incident report filed by Glynn County police, Arbery was shot Feb. 23 after two men spotted him running in their neighborhood and armed themselves with guns before getting in a truck to pursue him. Gregory McMichael told police that he and his adult son, Travis, thought the young man matched someone caught on a security camera committing a recent break-in in the neighborhood.

According to his father, Arbery didn’t live far from the Satilla Shores neighborhood where the McMichaels gave chase after spotting him on a Sunday afternoon.

The police report says Gregory McMichael told officers he and his son first tried to stop Arbery by shouting, “Stop, stop, we want to talk to you!”

McMichael said his son got out of the truck and Arbery “began to violently attack” him and “the two men then started fighting over the shotgun,” the police report said.

The police report says Gregory McMichael turned Arbery onto his back to see if he was armed — but the report doesn’t say whether he had a weapon or not.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based civil rights group, has demanded the U.S. Justice Department investigate.

A phone number listed for Gregory McMichael has been disconnected. The Associated Press could not immediately find a phone listing for Travis McMichael.

Jackie Johnson, the district attorney for Glynn County, recused herself from the case because Gregory McMichael worked as an investigator in her office. He retired a year ago.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-05/prosecutor-grand-jury-to-weigh-charges-in-georgia-shooting

She Previously Covered State', 'Federal Courts', 'Worked On Investigative Projects', 'Reported On Southern California S Korean Community.']",2020-05-05,Missing Major League Baseball? Here’s Korean baseball to the rescue,"Former U.S. major league player Kim Hyun-soo sent the ball cracking over the left-field fence, marking the first home run of the long-awaited season of South Korea’s beloved baseball league.

But instead of basking in thunderous applause and hollers from adoring fans, Kim loped across home plate to a smattering of claps from a few dozen reporters and league employees. After scoring two runs for his Seoul-based LG Twins, Kim approached a teammate who waited with his arms up, but caught himself at the last second, narrowly avoiding a high-five — banned by the league as a coronavirus precaution. He bumped elbows with another teammate.

Most of the stadium’s 25,553 seats — a tough get in a normal year for a game between the Twins and archrival Doosan Bears — were empty.

Baseball returned to South Korea under drizzly and overcast skies Tuesday, a rare professional sporting league to resume games while much of the world remains under lockdown with no end in sight to the COVID-19 pandemic. The five-game opening day showed South Korea testing the waters for a cautious return to normalcy on a day the country reported just three new cases of the coronavirus, a sign that the virus’ community spread has largely been halted.

With ESPN reaching an eleventh-hour deal to broadcast Korea Baseball Organization games, a host of U.S. fans starved for live sports were turning to the Korean league, with its distinct culture and avid fandom. Taiwan’s Chinese Professional Baseball League, which started up April 11, has also gained a following among Americans watching online.

“Major League Baseball teams [in the U.S.] are more corporate, a little more sterile, not as passionate. The KBO feels like a college football game,” said Dan Kurtz, a longtime fan behind the site MyKBO.net. Kurtz said he was being inundated with messages from sports-deprived Americans in the lead-up to the season. “The KBO is going to fill that void, and that’s awesome.”

The 144-game season, originally set to begin in late March, was pushed back a few times before getting underway with a number of precautions. A 44-page manual distributed to the league’s 10 teams outlined detailed protocols — including bans on high-fives and spitting, and the minimizing of player contact with the general public. All games will initially be conducted without spectators; the league has said it will consider phasing in a limited of number of fans at a later date.

On the field in Seoul’s Jamsil Baseball Stadium on Tuesday, umpires and base coaches wore masks and gloves. The mascot for the home-team Twins — twin robot boys named Lucky and Star — also wore masks, as did the team’s cheerleaders and a drum squad that did its best to make up for the absence of fans. When they fell silent, an uncanny hush blanketed the stadium, interrupted only by the whiz of nearby traffic and the satisfying thwack of hits.

The quiet was especially odd in a stadium typically filled with songs and chants customized to each hitter and situation and boisterously belted out by fervent fans throughout the game.

“Without them, it’s a totally different animal,” said Twins pitcher Tyler Wilson, formerly of the Baltimore Orioles, who has been playing in South Korea since 2018. “Their energy and their passion and how into it they are, from the first pitch to the end, is what makes the games so special.”

Wilson, who didn’t play in Tuesday’s opening game, said that, during this year’s pre-season games, it was so quiet he could hear the broadcasters’ commentary, conversations in the field and in the dugout, and even the sound of his own spikes going into the dirt.

Precautions began long before opening day. Former Angels catcher Hank Conger, starting his first season as a battery coach with the Busan-based Lotte Giants, said players had been dining with plexiglass barriers between them in the lunchroom and wearing masks on the bus. Former teammates in the U.S. were eyeing the situation in Korea enviously, he said.

“For us to finally start is surreal,” he said. “Everybody sees my Instagram and sees us getting ready for the season, and they’re saying, ‘I can’t believe you guys are playing.’”

Kim Tae-hyoung, the manager of the defending champions, the Doosan Bears, told reporters he wasn’t quite sure how the coronavirus-related measures and delays would affect his team, but at the end of the day, he just wanted to win.

“This is a first for me too,” he said.

A reporter asked if he had remarks for viewers from the U.S. watching KBO games for the first time.

“Do I have to say that in English?” he said, to laughs. “Give us a lot of love please.”

Outside the closed stadium gates, 25-year-old Kim Gwang-ho was among a handful of fans who showed up wearing team hats and jerseys. The longtime Twins fan watched the game on his cellphone while listening to what sounds he could make out over the stadium walls — and he was hoping for a selfie with a player after the game.

“I hope this corona situation ends so everyone can come and cheer them on, in time for fall baseball,” he said. “I hope they win the Korean series this year.”

After pulling ahead with Kim Hyun-soo’s early home run, the Twins beat the Bears 8-2. By the end of the nearly three-hour game, gray skies had given way to a picture-perfect sunny day.

Kurtz of MyKBO.net, who is a Bears fan, said all of Korean baseball and its fans scored a win Tuesday with the international attention being paid to a league normally overshadowed by U.S. Major League Baseball. He said he hoped the country’s overlooked sports would receive some of the acclaim its music and movies had been getting of late.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05,"Europe’s first coronavirus case may have been in December, weeks earlier than previously thought","French scientists say they may have identified a possible case of the coronavirus dating back to December — about a month before the first cases were officially confirmed in Europe.

In a study published in the International Journal of Microbial Agents, doctors at a hospital north of Paris reviewed retrospective samples of 14 patients treated for atypical pneumonia between early December and mid-January. Among those were the records of Amirouche Hammar, a fishmonger in his 40s from Algeria who has lived in France for years and had no recent travel history.

Hammar told French broadcaster BFM-TV on Tuesday that he drove himself to a hospital emergency unit at 5 a.m. one morning in late December because he felt very sick, with chest pains and breathing difficulties.

“They said, ‘Perhaps you have an infection, a pulmonary infection, although it’s not certain. But what you have is very serious, very serious, because you are coughing blood. It’s not normal flu,’” he said.

Advertisement

Hammar was admitted to the hospital with symptoms doctors say were consistent with COVID-19 patients in China and Italy. One of his children had also gotten sick with an unusual pneumonia shortly before Hammar fell ill. When doctors retested Hammar’s old sample, they found it was positive for the coronavirus.

“Identifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge” regarding the spread of the coronavirus, wrote Dr. Yves Cohen, one of the French researchers. An intensive care specialist, Cohen works in the northern suburbs of Paris where Hammar lives and which have been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 infections and deaths.

Cohen told BFM-TV that when Hammar sought treatment in December, they figured he was simply suffering from a form of viral pneumonia that they couldn’t put their finger on. “We told ourselves, ‘It’s a virus that we haven’t discovered,’ but we stopped there.”

Advertisement

There doesn’t appear to have been any further transmission of the virus from Hammar, who later recovered after being treated with antibiotics in the ICU. Cohen and colleagues suggested their results showed there could be many other unidentified coronavirus cases from before the disease was officially detected in Europe.

Still, the scientists acknowledged that because the study, which was published online Sunday, was done retrospectively, “medical records were not exhaustive and some relevant information might have been missing.”

Other experts said the results were interesting, but hardly conclusive.

Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in England, said it was possible the results were due to lab contamination.

“If he was infected [with COVID-19], then you would expect a more rapid and earlier spread of the virus in France than was seen,” he said in a statement. Ball wasn’t connected to the published study.

“Sequencing any virus in the sample might give you insight into whether or not the virus truly was an early isolate or likely contamination, but it looks from the data that the amount of virus in the sample was low, so would be difficult to analyze further,” he said.

Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh in the Scottish capital, said it was possible that in the early days of the disease’s emergence, there were many instances in which infected people traveled around the world but that the virus wasn’t spread any further.

"['Staff Writer', 'Faith E. Pinho Reports On Trending', 'Breaking News Stories For The Los Angeles Times.']",2020-05-05,Five ways to celebrate Cinco de Mayo at home,"Cinco de Mayo may look different this year — no large parties, please — but the annual Mexican celebration can offer some welcome distraction from the otherwise sluggishly same days of quarantine.

We’ve gathered a list — of five ideas, duh — to inspire your plans.



1. Support your local Mexican restaurant. Obviously.

Although 2020 may not seem to have a whole lot going for it, this year is one of those rare occurrences when Cinco de Mayo falls on Taco Tuesday.

Although most businesses are closed, chances are your favorite local spot for tacos, tamales or taquitos is still open. If it’s not, branch out and try one of the 20 Mexican restaurants offering delivery or takeout to which our restaurant critic Bill Addison gave his stamp of approval.

Cinco de Mayo is usually a boon for locally owned Mexican restaurants, and those that are still open could use the boost in revenue.

If you do go out to pick up food, don’t forget to wear a mask — you can buy one from these quinceañera dressmakers who are out of work.

If you feel safer at home, there are plenty of delicious Mexican dishes you can make in your own kitchen.



2. Read up on the Battle of Puebla.

No, Cinco de Mayo is not Mexican Independence Day. That’s in September.

Advertisement

But it is a popularly celebrated Mexican holiday — just mostly outside of Mexico. It commemorates the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, when the Mexican military trounced a French army at Puebla, the city the French were traveling through to reach Mexico City with plans to establish a satellite state. Although the French returned in full force the following year, the 1862 triumph marked a decisive victory for the Mexican military at the time.

The United States’ celebrations of the historic victory really took off in the mid 20th century, probably when alcohol companies began using it in promotions. Puebla is one of the few places in Mexico that still highlights the holiday, usually putting on a 19th century battle reenactment and a parade across the city.

While you’re researching, consider marking your calendar for Sept. 16 — the real Mexican Independence Day.



3. Take a Spanish lesson.

If you’ve been twiddling your thumbs, you might as well put them to good use while your tongue gets twisted learning a new language.

Duolingo’s language courses are free, but several other platforms, including Babbel and Rosetta Stone, offer interactive games and lessons.

You could also join the free language-exchange websites Conversation Exchange or My Language Exchange and practice your Spanish with native speakers who might teach you about the history of Cinco de Mayo via email, chat or Skype.



4. Support mariachis.

Whatever you decide to do, tune into some mariachi music while you’re doing it. The coronavirus decimated events where mariachi musicians would typically play, cutting off their source of income and inspiring some to play at Mariachi Plaza last month, asking Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for more economic support.

To honor the work of its musicians, the Mariachi Heritage Foundation, along with salsa maker Chi-Chi’s, is putting on a daylong virtual mariachi festival it’s calling “Singo de Mayo.”

Private 30-minute mariachi sessions filled up fast, so tune in to the live happy hour concert Tuesday evening.

5. Donate to cultural centers.

Museums, art galleries and cultural centers are struggling, and even small donations may help keep them alive until their doors reopen. There are several worthy recipients of your Cinco de Mayo dollars in California — such as the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach or the Mexican Cultural Center of Northern California .

Don’t despair; travel won’t be off-limits forever. Here are some things that can help you navigate these difficult times and plan for the future.



1. Can I get a travel refund?

There are as many answers to this question as there are things to do in the world.

Airlines: Each airline conducts its business differently. Many airlines now are more liberal than usual if you decide to change your flight, sometimes waiving change fees.

If the airline cancels the flight, under most circumstances it will try to accommodate you. If it can’t within the time it specifies, it may give you a voucher or a refund. Don’t be surprised if the airline mentions the voucher first or doesn’t mention the refund at all (unless it’s Southwest). If its website or agent doesn’t mention a refund for a flight it canceled, ask and ask again. Not all are forthcoming about refunds. Read more about airline refunds at lat.ms/airlinerefundscredits.

Cruise lines: Cruise lines worldwide suspended sailings March 13 as the coronavirus pandemic spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 9 extended the no-sail order for cruise ships in the U.S., with no firm return date announced. Carnival, Disney and other cruise lines are pushing back their return-to-service dates and canceling more trips. You can get a refund or a future cruise credit, which usually comes with perks and credits to keep you on board. Read more about cruise policies at lat.ms/cruiserefundscredits.

Other travel: Here’s good news if you have or make Amtrak reservations before May 31: If you cancel your ticket and want a refund, you can get one. The only catch: You must call (800) 872-7245. The refund cannot be completed on Amtrak.com or the Amtrak app. Amtrak is also waiving change fees for reservations before the end of May. Reservations may be modified by phone, Amtrak.com or the app.

Travelers holding Disneyland tickets for a date when the theme park is closed won’t get a refund, but they may postpone their visit. For information, go to lat.ms/disneycoronatickets.

2. What about my elite status with my airline’s loyalty program?

Airlines want you back. Really. U.S. carriers have allowed passengers to change or cancel flights without penalty fees during the coronavirus pandemic. Some are giving elite members of their loyalty programs automatic extensions of their status — some as long as 18 months. For example, American Airlines recently announced it would reward AAdvantage members by granting an automatic extension of their status until Jan. 31, 2022. Members can expect to see the change reflected in their accounts on May 15. The airline also lowered the qualifications for elite status. Here are more loyalty program details at lat.ms/airlineloyaltyrewards.



3. Can I go to Hawaii as planned?

Hawaii doubled down on its stay-at home order April 25. With Georgia and a few other states easing restrictions, Gov. David Ige went in the opposite direction. To stop the spread of coronavirus, he extended the state’s stay-at-home order until May 31. The order closed state parks and monuments, historical sites, recreation areas and many businesses. Ige’s order extended mandatory quarantine rules too. Anyone flying to the islands will have to quarantine at home or at their hotel for 14 days.



4. Should I travel at all in the U.S. right now?

The short answer: It’s up to you. Of course, the real answer is more complicated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually doesn’t give travel advice, but the agency’s website (lat.ms/cdctravelguidelines) devotes an entire page to questions and factors to consider. The California Department of Public Health follows those same guidelines.

You need to weigh whether you are putting yourself or others at risk. Are you sick or do you have underlying health conditions? You probably shouldn’t be traveling and increasing your risk of getting the disease. Is your travel urgent? Every U.S. state has confirmed cases of COVID-19. “This whole [novel coronavirus] problem is evolving. Look where we were two months ago,” said Dr. Robert Winters, an infectious disease specialist in Santa Monica. Bottom line: We don’t know what we don’t know about the novel coronavirus.

5. Should I make plans for a summer vacation?

Maybe. There are incredible travel deals right now, from airfares to rafting trips, and that trend probably will continue as the tourism industry acts to recover pandemic losses. If you book, it’s possible you may be financially protected in a way you have not been. Refunds are more plentiful, but so are problems. And the issue of refunds continues to evolve, as have polices and practices that determine whether you get back your money, a credit or nothing at all. Here’s a guide atlat.ms/summervacationplans to help you decide whether to take a chance and be rewarded with good value or take a chance and suffer a financial loss.

6. Can I renew my U.S. passport?

The U.S. State Department is not processing new passports and renewals except for emergency cases because of the coronavirus pandemic. As of March 20, “we are only able to offer service for customers with a qualified life-or-death emergency and who need a passport for immediate international travel within 72 hours,” the agency’s website says. Americans are being asked to wait to apply or renew until the agency resumes “normal operations.” If you already sent in your passport for renewal, you can expect significant delays.



7. I’m sick of working from home. Where else can I go?

Some Southern California luxury hotels will let you set up your virtual office for a day without having to stay overnight. For example, Paséa Hotel & Spa in Huntington Beach is offering Office Zen rooms for weekday use from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., starting at $69.

['Lexi Zeeman'],2020-05-02,L.A. Affairs: That moment when I tell my date about my purity ring,"I’ll set the scene for you real quick: It’s 8:17 p.m. on a Sunday. I‘d spent the entire day in my pajamas, only leaving my bed to venture into the bathroom (because obviously) and the kitchen (even more obviously) as I embarked on yet another lazy evening stewing in the blissful awareness of my singleness. In retrospect, it was like training for this self-quarantine.

Like many girls are all too familiar with, I’m sure, this led to the inevitable creation of an online dating profile. The second guy I allotted a right swipe to was Anthony. Mind you, I was being relatively picky because I had zero intention of doing anything.

The swiping right was fine, but then I had to go overboard with the whole “Hey there :)” situation.

Advertisement

We exchanged numbers and not .25 seconds later my phone lit up. I answered. Like a moth to a flame.

We found ourselves having those rare conversations that occur between strangers. The ones that flow without rationale and are devoid of analysis or much thought at all.

He made me laugh and feel beautiful without being anything close to objectified, which is really saying something in this Tinder world. We talked for two hours. Two. Hours. With a complete stranger.

Advertisement

His voice was deep in that way in which you can hear him say anything — “Hello,” even — and an involuntary lip-bite occurs. It just occurred again as I typed that out and started reliving it. So yes, it started with a sexy as hell “Hello” and then just spiraled from there.

We made plans for Friday night.

He’d said, “I’ll pick you up in 20 in my lime-green Camaro. It’s an acquired taste, so you’ve been warned.” I slipped on my lucky maroon pants and white tank top. Waiting in my driveway in Westwood was that outrageous car he warned me about, but also a handsome gent sitting inside.

Advertisement

We drove down Sunset Boulevard and, because I often feel like I’m watching my life instead of living it, it all felt like some Hollywood movie moment. Surrounded by the city lights on either side of us, I had to alternate from gazing at his handsome face and taking in the views of the city. He pulled up to Pink Taco and valet-parked. He wrapped a muscled arm around me as he guided me inside. There we talked about our past relationships, religion, politics — all the forbidden topics.

Before I could order my second margarita he pointed to that gold ring on my left hand and asked, “Is that some type of promise ring?”

I was so surprised that he even noticed.

Advertisement

Turned out that this boy not only saw my tiny ring on the half-phone-screen-sized picture from Bumble, but then still swiped right, texted me, called me and even asked me on a date.

I found myself back in that familiar moment — the one where I explain the tricky truth behind that golden band given to me by my mom a decade earlier, when I was 12.

This wasn’t just a piece of jewelry meant to keep the “bad boys” away. It was a promise. A promise to God and to myself that I would keep as many pieces of my heart (and body) for the one who would cherish me for longer than a night. I had no doubt God had something so beautiful in store. I just needed to be patient — and find someone whose patience mirrored my own.

As I sat there, I waited for Anthony to gracefully bow out of the race.

Advertisement

Spoiler alert: That’s not what he did. When I finished explaining he didn’t try to challenge why I was doing it. He didn’t ask if it was hard. He didn’t ask if I thought I would change my mind. He didn’t ask what the limits were, or even if I’d ever broken them before with someone else.

He smiled at me and said, “Honestly, I think that is the coolest thing ever ... I respect you so much for sticking to it. Don’t ever change your mind about it.”

I know it would be so much more romantic to say that his answer and our chemistry were parallel in perfection, and that we are still together, heading toward a wedding day.

The reason time hasn’t erased this evening isn’t because I fell in love.

Advertisement

His reaction to my purity ring stands as my measuring stick for the boys who have followed.

It all looked perfect and in the moment; on paper, there wasn’t a single thing wrong with Anthony. But we didn’t have sparks. Sparks are not to be confused with butterflies, two very different things. Sparks are passion. Sparks are fearless. They are the click or connection that makes the difference between a friendship and a romance. They are something that you don’t really find often. To me, sparks are necessary for a forever love.

After we said our goodbyes that night, I never accepted another invitation to meet up again.

For the first time in my dating history, though, the lack of a second date had nothing to do with its inevitable lack of sex.

That night, though, proved something to me — something city life and L.A. players made me question more each day.

I hold this story close because Anthony stands as the boy who reminded me what I was worth, at the moment I desperately needed to hear it.

Ladies, they exist.

The ones we are looking for, they really do.

The boundaries I chose for myself are valid. The standards you’ve set, well, they might be different than mine but there’s a reason you’ve chosen them. And they matter.

Anthony was my stepping stone. He reminded me to be hopeful. Choosing to have sex to fill someone else’s needs wasn’t going to bring me the love I so desired. In the chaos of Los Angeles, maybe you need that reminder too.

['Shan Boodram'],2020-05-01,‘I’m watching a ton of porn. Is that OK?’ An expert answers coronavirus sex questions,"Shan Boodram is an Los Angeles-based certified sex educator with 598,000 subscribers on YouTube, and a new daily show on Quibi, “Sexology With Shan.” Here, she shares answers to some of our most intimate questions:

This pandemic — and sheltering in place — is killing my sex drive. Is that normal?

It is 100% natural for too much proximity to kill sex drive. And not even just too much proximity but a lot of proximity amidst a very stressful time with constant negative news. That is not a natural aphrosdisiac. The result? You don’t feel like having sex.

Fire needs air to breathe. And passion, similarly, needs air to breathe. And when you are on top of each other all the time and you’re not giving the brain any kind of new or novel experience or anything new to stem off of, to spitball into sexual tension, then it’s very difficult to get your libido going. So it’s normal.

It doesn’t have to be normal. The fun thing about the word “normal” is that you get to decide what that means. And so if this is something that you’re accepting because this quarantine time is not forever, that’s all right. But if you’re not OK with that, you can adjust this normal by reducing the stressful content you allow into your home and coming up with coping strategies together that put both of you in a refreshed mind space.

And finally, look for ways to create dopamine-inducing exciting experiences in the home, whether that be time apart, whether that be utilizing porn, utilizing different environments, or driving somewhere and maybe having sex where it’s out there in the world. I’m not really quite sure what would feel fresh for you, but you have to search for that fresh experience to reignite that passion. Again, normal is subjective. But is it OK? Absolutely. It’s OK right now if you’re not in the mood and your partner’s not either.

I’m single and I live alone. So quarantining is so hard when I have almost no human contact. I miss sex, dating and meeting new people.

That is OK. And not only is it OK, it is extremely healthy. We are mammals that are born to bond. We are born to be with other people. We crave romantic connections. We crave intimacy. We crave human touch, and if you are missing those that just means that you’re human. Now, does this mean that you should act out on it? Absolutely not. Nothing is more important than your health and the health of those around you, but there are unique ways that people can still engage with others. There are the obvious dating apps — OKCupid said there were more messages sent in March as a result of the quarantine. So people are looking to connect if you are. There are also a ton of opportunities for cybersex, a ton of opportunities for utilizing social media platforms. Of course, nothing can replace the real thing. But there are ways to ensure that you still do have sexual connection to others without compromising your health.

I’m watching a ton of porn lately — it somehow feels wrong.

No, you should definitely check out some of the stats from PornHub and other sites about porn consumption these days. They’re also finding spikes in porn watching really, really late in the night. So people are staying up later because they’re not going to work and that leads to more porn consumption. That is normal.

I think it’s actually quite beautiful because it’s people trying to create a normal during these very abnormal times, and preserving sex and making sex still be a thing. That’s OK in a time where we can’t touch or be within six feet of people — it can be actually very soothing, it can be a coping mechanism for some people.

It’s only weird if you feel like it’s preventing you from focusing on other areas that could be helping you in this time of quarantine. So, for example, if you feel so overly consumed with porn to the extent that you’re not connecting with family and friends, you’re not connecting with others, the porn consumption is making you feel worse, not better — that’s when it’s cause for pause. But if it’s actually helping you and making you feel better and helping you to adjust to this time, then I say that you’re not alone. You’re not wrong.

With all of our new free time in quarantine, my partner wants to have sex more than ever. How can we find a sexual balance that works for both of us?

I think the balance comes in looking at coping strategies versus sexual libido. Your coping strategies might massively impact why you want to have sex more, or why you’re not interested in sex at all. There are going to be so many babies at the end of this year as a result of this quarantine, but a lot of people have no interest in having sex at all. Stress is not a natural sexual pick-me-up. On the flip side, though, there’s something known as arousal confusion. That’s what happens when your body misinterprets signals like adrenaline spikes and elevated heart rate that are due to fear or stress and that your body can perceive as physiological arousal. So stress can actually make somebody get hornier or heighten feelings that can make someone get horny. It’s kind of similar to why some people get really horny during an argument. So that might be happening to your partner. You might be having the adverse reaction. And the way to meet in the middle is to focus more on how are we handling this uniquely stressful time. What are our tools and strategies to bring us both to a space where we feel good and we’re making the healthiest decision for ourselves? And more important, how can you empathize with your partner during a time when, more than anything, they just need to be supported?

I have found myself masturbating a lot more than usual. Is this normal? Any other suggestions for dealing with sexual tension?

I don’t think that anyone gets to say what’s normal during an unprecedented, historically unique time. Don’t be so hard on yourself. That’s my advice for everybody: Make yourself feel OK. And that may look different for each person. Don’t worry so much about what everybody else is doing. Really focus on what’s enriching you and what’s allowing you to have the best shot of coming out of this as healthy and as happy as possible. If masturbation is a part of that formula for you, I’d say absolutely continue.

Any other suggestions for dealing with sexual tension?

Yes, you can engage with other people by digisexuality, which is engaging with sex using technology as a liaison. On my new show on Quibi, we have an entire episode on digisexuality during the COVID-19 outbreak and how to utilize technology to enhance your sex life. A famous sex expert said that the safest sexual partner during this time is yourself, but cybersexuality or digisexuality challenges that and allows you to experience pleasure alongside others or even at the hand of others without actually physically being touched — that’s through the use of some toys that allow for remote control.

My partner and I are staying with his parents during the quarantine and it’s really hard to have sex with these thin walls.

How to keep things hot in a situation like this! This sounds like the Christmas dilemma, except now we’re in spring. So it’s slightly warmer. I think that hot sex might still be an option if you guys do have a car and make sure you wipe everything down and wash your hands before and after. Maybe that’s your only chance of a getaway and also in a space that you can control who’s been there and who’s been within six feet of it. Other things you can do: Maybe it’s timing walks. If you guys are all doing daily walks or exercise, maybe you have some alone time when your parents go out for their walks. That might even be a conversation for you to have with them: “We need a bit of alone time. Would you mind just giving us a text when you’re on your way back from your walk?” I don’t know what your relationship is like with your parents, but it sounds like you’re staying with them so they must acknowledge you do have a sex life. Also, there’s quiet sex.

Finding creative ways to overcome this together can actually help to heighten sex drive and to bring a bit of danger to the situation that might increase your libido. So lean into that. Be creative with your partner. Be novel in your approach to solving this and be thankful that you’re in a home with parents who are probably cooking all your favorite meals right now, because that’s definitely where I wish I was right now.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-05-01/sex-expert-shan-boodram-answers-your-coronavirus-sex-questions

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index closed up 0.9%, although it lost about half of its early gains in a late-in-the-session burst of selling. Technology and healthcare stocks accounted for much of the gains, which followed a strong showing in overseas markets.

Investors are cautiously optimistic that the gradual reopening of some businesses will begin to turn around the economy.

In California, some retail businesses could begin serving customers again as early as Friday, under some restrictions. Many European countries have also begun relaxing strict orders meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, while waiting to see if it leads to a resurgence in infections. In Asia, the first pitches of the South Korean baseball season thwacked into catchers’ mitts, albeit in stadiums with no fans in attendance.

Expectations for stronger demand for oil as more businesses get the green light to open helped drive the price of oil sharply higher, extending its mini-rally after it fell to record lows last month.

“It’s investors getting a little bit ahead of themselves,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “Maybe it’s a sense of relief that we’ve made it this far and there’s some sort of a path forward, even if it’s not real clear.”

Delwiche noted that questions remain about the pace at which people will venture out of their homes and spend money as businesses reopen.

The S&P 500 index rose 25.70 points to 2,868.44. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 133.33 points, or 0.6%, to 23,883.09. The Nasdaq climbed 98.41 points, or 1.1%, to 8,809.12. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks advanced 9.54 points, or 0.8%, to 1,273.51.

The stock market has been rallying since late March as investors look beyond the devastation that’s ravaging the global economy. They’re focusing instead on the prospects for a resumption of growth later in the year, as well as on the massive support for markets provided by the Federal Reserve. Many analysts are skeptical of the stock market’s rally, saying it’s overdone given all the uncertainty about how long the recession will last, but the S&P 500 has nevertheless more than halved its losses from its sell-off earlier in the year.

A report released Tuesday showed that the U.S. services industry last month shrank for the first time in a decade, but that caused barely a ripple in the stock or bond market. The data weren’t quite as terrible as economists had forecast.

”What we should be watching for is not that things are good; things are not going to be good,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “We should be watching for signs that things are less bad.”

”Just getting people back to work and businesses open again can improve attitudes and confidence,” he said.

Walt Disney Co. fell 3% in extended trading after the company reported a steep drop in quarterly profit as many segments of its media and entertainment offerings ground to a standstill during the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, Disney said costs related to COVID-19 cut its pretax profit by $1.4 billion.

Hopes that the reopening of economies will eventually lead to a pickup in demand have also very recently helped oil prices climb off the floor. U.S. oil to be delivered in June jumped 20.5% to settle at $24.56 a barrel Tuesday, up from a low of $6.50 late last month. That’s still well below the roughly $60 a barrel it cost at the start of the year: The price plunged on worries that the collapse in oil demand would lead to topped-off storage tanks.

Brent crude, the standard for international pricing, rose 13.9% to $30.97 per barrel.

“The feeling on the floor is that energy is in a better spot, and while it’s not brilliant,“ the gulf between oil supplies and demand “is starting to shift in a more positive direction,” Chris Weston of Pepperstone said in a report.

Technology stocks continued their strong run. Apple rose 1.5%. Microsoft gained 1.1%. The two companies alone account for 11% of the S&P 500’s entire market value. Tech stocks in the S&P 500 have nearly erased all their losses for 2020, after earlier being down as much as 23%. The sector is now down 0.3%.

In Europe, Germany’s DAX rose 2.5%, the CAC 40 in Paris gained 2.4% and the FTSE 100 in London rose 1.7%.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 1.1% as the government said it would relax some social distancing measures, allowing certain businesses such as gyms, cinemas and beauty salons to reopen and doubling the number of individuals allowed at public gatherings to a maximum of eight.

['Lisa Lee'],2020-05-05,The Fed once warned about fuzzy accounting. Now it’s propping up firms that use it,"For years, the Federal Reserve warned that too many companies were engaging in fuzzy accounting that bumped up their earnings — making it easier for them to obtain loans. The practice — known as adjusted Ebitda — was driving up corporate debt to excessive and worrisome levels, regulators chastised.

But now, in its latest effort to keep credit flowing, the Fed has done a remarkable about-face. It essentially endorsed the dubious practice with a program that may serve to bail out some of the nation’s most leveraged companies.

The Fed move “rewards the worst abusers,” said Mark Carey, a former Fed official and co-president of GARP Risk Institute, the research arm of an association of risk managers. “People will see this as a backstop and in the future they will be encouraged to take on really high leverage.”

The reversal came in the Fed’s announcement last week to expand its Main Street Lending Program to allow more small and medium-sized businesses to qualify for as much as $600 billion in loans. That was widely applauded. But less noticed was a provision that allows companies that had used the widely abused accounting techniques in the past to seek the loans.

At issue is the trend among many leveraged companies to “adjust” a key measure of their results — known as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda — to make themselves appear more creditworthy. After intense lobbying by business groups, the Fed has now said those adjusted earnings can be used for the Main Street lending program, rather than the earnings figured using generally accepted accounting standards.

The ability of companies to inflate projections, by for example counting expected savings from a cost-cutting program, is generally legal and an accepted practice. But it can distort the lending process and raises questions about the company’s ability to repay loans. That’s especially crucial now. Unlike the government’s Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, the Main Street loans are required to be paid back.

The Fed included some guardrails in the program to limit losses. The banks that originate the loans are to have skin in the game by holding between 5% to 15% of the loan amount. And loans for part of the facility must have ratings that could exclude the most aggressive debt.

Carey and others also note that the Fed’s motivation — to lend support to even more businesses and to prevent widespread waves of bankruptcy from further hobbling the economy — is understandable. But they also worry about the message it’s sending to companies and lenders, that the central bank will bail them out regardless of how egregious their actions, a concept known as moral hazard.

“As the Fed issues alarms about certain assets going forward, it raises the question whether private sector participants will listen to it,” said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income.

The Fed’s historic action, lending directly for the first time since Word War II, came after Congress set aside capital to to support lending to smaller businesses. The first announcement, on March 23, allowed companies with high-yield bonds or leveraged loans to participate as well. In weighing their credit strength, the Fed said that it would consider their Ebitda. But the market was left confused by whether that meant adjusted Ebitda or standard Ebitda.

The latest statement on April 30 clarified what the Fed meant: Adjusted would be accepted.

Advertisement

That marks a stark contrast with a series of Fed warnings going back to 2013 aimed at reining in risky lending practices. A Fed official in 2018 noted “material loosening of terms and weaknesses in risk management,” particularly in adjustments to Ebitda.

“The presence of these practices, especially without the appropriate controls, may lead to safety and soundness concerns,” Todd Vermilyea, a senior Fed official, said in a speech.

And two years before that, Fed bank supervisors cautioned Goldman Sachs Group Inc. over risk to a debt deal it arranged to fund a $4-billion buyout of Ultimate Fighting Championship, according to people familiar with the matter at the time. Regulators were concerned about UFC’s use of accounting adjustments that more than doubled its Ebitda projections.

Advertisement

That was just one of many changes to Ebitda that have flared into a serious and pervasive problem in recent years, regulators and market players have said. These adjustments, known as add-backs in accounting lingo, increased from an average 9% at the start of 2015 to well north of 20% in 2019 for merger-related leveraged loan issuance, according to research firm Covenant Review.

Inflating Ebitda can help an indebted company borrow more, and in the process distort the loan-to-value ratio that guides the $2.9-trillion market for junk bonds and loans in the U.S. and Europe.

To see how adjustments affect creditworthiness, loans involved with mergers and acquisition last year had debt loads that were 5.5 times its Ebitda. But take out the adjustments and that ratio jumps to an extremely high 7.5 times, according to Covenant Review.

The new Fed lending facility limits debt to no more than six times earnings for a company to be eligible for two of the programs.

Advertisement

But for companies that have played the adjustment game, that leverage cap becomes less relevant, said Scott Macklin, director of leveraged loan strategies at asset manager AllianceBernstein.

“We foresee the ability for companies which are far more levered than six times to take advantage of the program given the creative adjustments to Ebitda often marketed,” he said.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-05/fed-fuzzy-accounting

Despite clear evidence that the idea makes no sense whatsoever in the context of the current economic crisis — and would be dead on arrival in the Democratic congressional caucus anyway — Trump keeps returning to it. Most recently, he brought it up Sunday during his appearance on Fox News.

Referring to plans for another stimulus bill, Trump said: “As I told Steve [Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary] just today, we’re not doing anything unless we get a payroll tax cut.”

By pushing to cut off the program’s funding stream, President Trump is taking the first step toward dismantling Social Security. Max Richtman, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare

In all his references to the payroll tax cut over the last few weeks, Trump hasn’t offered any indication that he understands the payroll tax, knows what it’s used for, or why as a tool to get cash into the hands of Americans it would be better than any other option.

It’s possible that whoever has been putting the idea in his head understands that it would threaten the stability of Social Security, which receives most of the tax, but that’s hardly a comforting thought.

“By pushing to cut off the program’s funding stream, President Trump is taking the first step toward dismantling Social Security,” says Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

Is this even a genuine idea in Trump’s mind?

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) had a properly skeptical reaction Monday when she was asked about it during an interview with CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer. “I can’t spend a whole lot of time on the quote of the day from the president of the United States,” she said dismissively.

No kudos for Blitzer, however, who kept nattering on about Trump’s comment as though it were (a) serious and (b) intelligent.

“Why is a payroll tax cut a nonstarter?” he asked Pelosi. Moments later, after Pelosi commented that in negotiations for the next stimulus bill, “we’re talking about life and death, we’re talking about people dying, we’re talking about people risking their lives to save people’s lives,” Blitzer came back with, “But what’s wrong with a payroll tax cut?”

Advertisement

He returned robotically to this theme three more times during his 5 1/2-minute encounter with the speaker.

This is how CNN displays its irrelevancy in the debate over the nation’s coronavirus response. Blitzer’s staff, one can safely wager, is capable of independently appraising the wisdom or stupidity of a payroll tax cut and providing its findings to CNN’s audience.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump’s demand for a payroll tax cut is a non-starter for the new coronavirus stimulus bill. “Nobody’s putting anything on the table and saying, ‘unless we have this, we’re not doing that.’ He shouldn’t either.” https://t.co/LDAxWW64S8 pic.twitter.com/cnFYcQTMkp — The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) May 4, 2020

Instead, Blitzer spent more than five minutes trying to back Pelosi into a negotiating position — which if he knows Pelosi at all, he must know was never going to happen. Or perhaps he was trying to take charge of the negotiations himself.

Advertisement

So Blitzer wasted five minutes of his time, Pelosi’s time, and your and my time in this bootless exercise, as though the only thing at stake is whether Pelosi or Trump emerges from the legislative process with bragging rights.

Since CNN appears to be incapable of doing its homework on the payroll tax or thinking for itself, it falls to us to do it for them.

So here, once again, is all that’s wrong with a payroll tax cut.

To begin with, it would do nothing to help Americans who need the most help. To benefit from a payroll tax cut, a worker must be paying the payroll tax. That’s not happening for the 30 million Americans who have filed for unemployment benefits in the last few weeks, because by definition they’re no longer on a payroll.

The payroll tax cut would have zero benefit for millions of Americans who don’t pay into Social Security, including many state and local workers who aren’t covered by the system, and seniors already receiving Social Security benefits, who are no longer paying the tax.

Moreover, even for many workers still receiving paychecks, the tax cut would be trivial to the point of being nugatory. If the payroll tax of 6.2% were to be cut in half, that would give a household collecting $50,000 a year in wages a benefit this year of $1,550, or about $30 a week.

The tax cut would be poorly targeted. It would go to every wage earner, no matter how affluent. The benefit of the 50% cut would come to $4,269, or $82 a week, for those earning the maximum wage covered by the payroll tax ($137,700 this year).

As I reported when Trump first tried to draw a line in the sand in favor of a payroll tax cut, roughly two-thirds of it would go to the rich.

Specifically, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit think tank that tracks how taxes and tax breaks are distributed along the income spectrum, 65% of the benefit would go to the top 20% of earners — those making $118,700 or more a year. Fully 25% of the benefit would go to the top 1%. That group collects income of $643,700 or more, with an average income of $2 million.

The poorest 20%, with income below $24,200, would receive only 2% of the benefit. The next poorest 20% would receive 6% of the benefit.

An effective stimulus requires a benefit that is immediate and noticeable. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, for instance, provided one-time government checks of up to $1,200 for married couples, including $300 per child.

The payments were phased out starting with household income of $150,000 (for couples), but even low-income households that owed no federal tax were eligible for at least $300, provided they earned at least $3,000 during the year.

Studies later found that recipients pumped as much as 90% of the payments into the economy within three months. As former Federal Reserve Governor Claudia Sahm reported , “Stimulus that is not seen or recognized by individuals is unlikely to affect their sentiment.”

Some supporters of a payroll tax cut point to the cut enacted as a stimulus measure in 2011, during the Obama administration. But that was enacted because Republicans made clear President Obama would have no choice — they flatly rejected every other option. And since they controlled Congress, they got their way.

Obama saw the cut as an unpalatable choice, but it was “the best we could do at the time given the political constraints,” his former economic advisor Jason Furman noted in March, when Trump first started talking about the cut as a coronavirus stimulus option. “But it was far from optimal then and would be even further from optimal now.”

Given its obvious shortcomings as an economic tool, it’s hard not to focus on the subtext of the GOP love for a payroll tax cut. It’s an attack on Social Security, a program Republicans have tried to undermine for all its 85 years.

“Social Security is an earned benefit fully funded by the contributions of workers throughout their working lives,” Richtman informed Trump in an April 24 letter.

“A payroll tax cut or deferral chips away at that fundamental idea, making it easier each time it is enacted to turn to it again to meet some future crisis, until the payroll tax is not just cut or deferred but is eliminated. Undermining the program in this manner would help achieve the goals of opponents of Social Security including those who would privatize the program.”

That’s what this is all about, even if Trump doesn’t know it. Trump whisperers know he has room for no more than one idea in his head on any topic, and once he’s grasped onto it, it’s hard to dislodge. Here are the ideas that need to supplant it: A payroll tax cut won’t help most Americans, it will go mostly to the rich, and it will harm a program that many Trump voters hold dear.

The new product complements a face-covering mandate Frontier is imposing for passengers starting Friday to help guard against the spread of the new coronavirus, along with a “health requirement” customers must accept before they can check in for a flight.

As part of that new system, Frontier travelers must check their temperature, attest that neither they nor anyone in their household has exhibited COVID-19 related symptoms for 14 days and wash their hands or use sanitizer before boarding a flight on Denver-based Frontier, which is owned by private equity firm Indigo Partners LLC.

Large carriers such as American Airlines and Delta Air Lines say they’ve begun blocking many middle seats to promote greater distance among passengers. The airlines don’t guarantee a middle seat will be unoccupied and they generally may assign them as needed.

Last week, American said it would sell only half the middle seats available in its economy cabin, though it will assign those seats when necessary. Southwest Airlines Co. is also limiting its seat sales to promote greater spacing but did not specify by how much.

“We are well aware that all airlines, Frontier included, are making efforts to allow people to spread out,” De La Cruz said in an email. “But the opportunity for those measures will taper off as more people start flying.”

Ultra low-cost airlines such as Frontier, Spirit Airlines and Ryanair generally need to sell more of their seats to break even than do larger airlines that have more frills that generate revenue and generally higher fares.

Last month, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said his airline, which has suspended most of its flights, would not resume operating if government regulators require empty middle seats that can’t be sold.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/travel/story/2020-05-05/frontier-airlines-to-charge-passengers-to-social-distance-on-flights

All other sailings in North America will be suspended through Aug. 31.

The company said it was taking a “measured approach” to resume sailing by starting with ports where most passengers arrive by car rather than by air. The cruise line also promised new health safety protocols to avoid the spread of the coronavirus.

Eight of Carnival’s ships plan to return to the sea in August: Dream, Freedom, Vista, Horizon, Magic, Sensation, Breeze and Elation. The first sailings will visit the eastern and western Caribbean as well as the Bahamas. Four-day cruises from Miami to Key West, Fla., and Cozumel, Mexico, start at $139 per person on Aug. 6 and 20. Four-day cruises from Port Canaveral to the Bahamas and Princess Cays starts at $149 per person on Aug. 13 and 27.

It’s a first planned step for cruises that have been suspended since mid-March. Cruise ships are under orders from the CDC not to sail to or from U.S. ports after several cruise ships reported outbreaks of the disease on board.

Carnival originally canceled cruises through June 30. Now the company canceled all other North American and Australia cruises through Aug. 31. In addition, cruises to Alaska are dropped as well as two longer itineraries: Vancouver to Honolulu that was set to sail Sept. 25, and Honolulu to Brisbane, Australia, which was supposed to depart Oct. 6.

Passengers will be offered a future cruise credit with extra perks or a refund.

Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah on May 6 plans to open trails around the red-rock spires of the Bryce Amphitheater, its most visited area. The main park road and viewpoints along the way will be open from the entrance to Rainbow Point. However, the visitor center, campgrounds, backcountry trails and restrooms remain closed (except for one at Sunset Point), a park announcement said.

Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which straddles Utah and Arizona, will reopen up in phases. On May 8, major boat ramps for popular Lake Powell will open for days use Fridays through Sundays. A week later, the ramps will open daily for overnight visitors. By May 22, most of Glen Canyon’s 1.25 million acres of lakeside shoreline and hiking trails will be accessible to the public.

Everglades National Park in Florida plans to reopen some boat launch ramps, campgrounds and restrooms May 4; Great Smoky Mountain National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee will allow visitors on many roads and trails starting May 9.

In Denali National Park, rangers have opened a portion of Denali Park Road, allowing public into the park again, and NPS officials have said that the shortage of cruise visitors this summer could open more room for visitors by car. Several lodges at the end of the park road in the Denali community of Kantishna are making plans to open this summer, an NPS notice said, noting the spring plowing operations “are on schedule to get the road open for summer.”

Some parks never officially closed (like Channel Islands). Some, like Yosemite, are such magnets for visitors that superintendents felt obliged to close them relatively early. Still others, like the Grand Canyon, closed later despite heavy visitor traffic.

At other parks, it’s harder to be sure what’s happening when.

Grand Canyon and Yellowstone national parks remain closed. In California, Yosemite, Joshua Tree and Death Valley national parks remain closed.

But in hopes of reopening soon, the Oasis at Death Valley, a privately owned lodging inside that park, is taking reservations for June 15 and beyond.

Grand Teton National Park remains closed, but the Signal Mountain Lodge, sited on the park’s Jackson Lake, has announced plans to open June 5 through Oct. 17. Not all units will open. The lodge’s website explains that to make distancing possible, the site is mostly relying on units in which guests can cook for themselves, to improve social distancing.

But the lodge’s general store and gift shop are to open for roughly the same dates, with restaurants reduced to a grab-and-go menu. The lodge website says campground operations are expected to proceed as usual.

Meanwhile in the offices of Grand Teton National Park, spokeswoman Denise Germann cautions visitors not to jump to conclusions about the park reopening.

“What we’re looking at is, location by location, as it is deemed safe, parks will begin to reopen,” Germann said. “Any dates that anybody is putting out [from Grand Teton] are ‘no-earlier-than’ dates,” Germann said. “What we’re doing is working with local, regional and national health officials to open when it’s safe to do so.”

The lodge’s management, she said, is “identifying a date so that they can at least communicate with guests.” Lodge management did not immediately return a phone message.

National parks began planning the phased reopenings Thursday after the federal stay-at-home order expired.

The move to begin reopening parks brought complaints from the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, a group representing 1,800 current, former, and retired employees and volunteers of the National Park Service. The group contends that the decision was premature.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/travel/story/2020-05-01/national-parks-start-to-reopen

Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order. But as the fight against the pandemic evolves and summer nears, the rules are rapidly changing, especially at beaches.

On Tuesday, Laguna Beach beaches opened after weeks of closure, but they will only be open 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on weekdays, for active use only, under a deal reached between local and state officials. They will remain closed on weekends.

In San Clemente, too, beaches reopened after an agreement between state and local leaders. In that case, the city’s beaches will be open daily for active use only (no fishing or sunbathing). The city’s pier reopened on Tuesday with social-distancing requirements. Beach restrooms and parking remain closed.

On Tuesday morning, state officials released letters authorizing Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Seal Beach officials to open their beaches. The letters, sent by Mark S. Ghilarducci, director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services; and

Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the state Natural Resources Agency, say the cities have drafted beach management plans that conform with state rules, and the stage urges local officials that “vigilance will be necessary” to keep citizens safe.

Meanwhile in the City of Los Angeles, officials said plans are in the works to completely close L.A.'s Griffith Park and other city parks on Mother’s Day (Sunday), in the same way that those parks were closed on Easter to discourage crowds from gathering. No officials announcement has yet been made, but those parks are likely to shut down at sunset Saturday and reopen Monday morning.

Conflicts between cautious state officials and restless local leaders came to a head Thursday, when Newsom overruled local Orange County officials to close Huntington Beach and Newport Beach after they drew substantial weekend crowds. Most Orange County beaches remain closed under the governor’s action.

L.A. County’s beaches are still closed through May 15 under the county’s Safer at Home order, and local, state and federal agencies throughout the region are severely limiting access to hundreds of beaches, parks, trails and forests.

Ventura and San Diego counties have been gradually opening their beaches. In both of those counties, as it Orange and San Diego counties, officials have closed beach-adjacent parking lots, hoping to encourage people to stay within their own walking neighborhoods.

This list is designed to help readers keep track of beach restrictions.

Here’s an update on what’s happening where. If you do go outside for a walk, remember these tips for keeping safe. Local and state officials stress the need to take greater care in maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others.



Los Angeles city parks, beaches and markets

City Recreation and Parks officials say most most park areas “remain open for walking and running.” But they are enforcing a range of restrictions. Among them: All public hiking trails and trailheads in the city of Los Angeles have been closed since March 27.

Also closed are all public beaches, public beach parking lots, beach bathrooms, piers, beach access points and the Venice Boardwalk and Ocean Front Walk (with limited access to essential businesses).

All recreation centers, aquatic facilities, golf courses, skate parks, tennis courts, playgrounds, baseball fields, soccer fields and basketball courts are also closed, as are other “indoor and outdoor sport amenities.”

In Griffith Park, authorities have closed all facilities and trails, including the Observatory, Travel Town, train rides, the pony rides, the merry-go-round and some roads. But the bicycle rental operation has been open.

Elsewhere, the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro remains closed, as is the Sherman Oaks Castle, the Expo Center in Exposition Park; and the Silver Lake Meadow. Since April 11, walkers and joggers have been required to travel counterclockwise on the 2.2-mile loop trail around the Silver Lake and Ivanhoe reservoirs.

Los Angeles County trails and beaches

Since March 27, L.A. County officials have enforced the closure of trails, trailheads, beaches and other public lands. (This list details closures.) All of the county’s park play and sports amenities, including golf courses, are also closed.

Los Angeles County’s beaches, piers, beach bike paths, beach access points, public trails, trailheads and tennis courts are also closed, under an order that covers beaches in every coastal city and unincorporated area of the county.

Parks officials noted on their website that “you can still enjoy time outdoors at your local park for passive use, such as walking, jogging, or leisure time outdoors for individuals or families. Social distancing is still required, and group gatherings are prohibited by the health order.”

Since March 23, the county has forbidden use of its multiuse trail system, a network of more than 220 miles that includes popular Eaton Canyon Trail; all interior trails at Vasquez Rocks; all interior trails at Placerita Canyon; the Loop Trail, Devil’s Chair and South Fork Trail at Devil’s Punchbowl; the San Dimas Nature Trail; the Schabarum-Skyline Trail; and dozens of other popular routes.



Los Angeles County beach cities and Catalina Island

• In Santa Monica, city beaches, the beach bike path and Ocean Front Walk closed March 27 as part of the countywide order to shut down beaches. The city’s Palisades Park, which overlooks the beach and pier, is also closed.

• In Hermosa Beach, the pier, Strand and beach itself are closed as part of the countywide beach closure.

• In Redondo Beach the pier, Strand and beach also are closed. City officials closed the Esplanade area; Veterans Park and nearby parking areas; all public walkways, stairways, ramps and paths to the beach; and a coastal bluff trail between Knob Hill Avenue and George Freeth Way.

• On Catalina Island, the Catalina Chamber of Commerce is urging non-residents to stay away. The Catalina Express, which usually runs boats to the island’s Avalon and Two Harbors landings from Long Beach, San Pedro and Dana Point, has cut back its service to two round trips a day between Long Beach and Avalon. At the Catalina Flyer, which normally offers one departure daily from Newport Beach to Avalon, a phone recording warned that the boat has suspended service until further notice. The Catalina Island Conservancy has closed its visitor facilities, services and trails.



State parks in Southern California

On March 18, state parks officials closed all state campgrounds. On March 29, they tightened restrictions further, closing vehicle access to the entire state park system — 280 parks, including off-road vehicle areas.

Since then, the state has fully closed dozens of parks, banning pedestrians as well as vehicles. Among them: The Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve; more than a dozen state parks and beaches in L.A. County; San Clemente State Beach in Orange County; seven state beaches in San Diego County; and four state beaches and parks in Ventura County.

But more recently, some parks have quietly reopened, while still keeping their roadways and parking lots closed to discourage visitors from outside the immediate area. On Monday morning, Carlsbad, South Carlsbad and Torrey Pines state beaches reopened that way, with visitors limited to active recreation and no group gatherings.

At Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area in the Baldwin Hills area of L.A., officials said in a statement that the park is closed to vehicular access but “remains open for locals who wish to walk, hike and bike (in parks with bike trails) in the park, provided they practice social/physical distancing of 6 feet or more. This is not the time for a road trip to a destination park or beach.”



San Gabriel Valley

In the first week of April, Pasadena city officials closed the Rose Bowl Loop, a popular 3.1-mile- walking path around the famed stadium.

The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino is closed through at least May 15.

Descanso Gardens in La Cañada Flintridge is closed until further notice. The L.A. Arboretum in Arcadia is open; reservations are required to prevent crowding.

Santa Monica Mountains

The National Park Service has imposed weekend closures on all Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area trails, trailheads, restrooms, overlooks and pullouts in Ventura County. Authorities said those areas will remain open on weekdays, when crowds are thinner.

Those weekend closures begin at 2 p.m. Fridays and reopen at 6 a.m. Mondays “until further notice,” an NPS release said.

That policy covers Rancho Sierra Vista (including the Wendy Trailhead); Cheeseboro Canyon Trailhead; the Deer Creek area; and all trails within Circle X, which includes Sandstone Creek, Mishe Mokwa, the Grotto Trail, the trails and overlooks along Yerba Buena Road and the Backbone Trail along the spine of the Santa Monicas.

As part of the earlier L.A. County-wide closure of hiking trails, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area had already shut down all of its trails and restrooms in L.A. County.

Advertisement

Also, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority on March 23 closed all of its parklands, trail and facilities — close to 75,000 acres of parkland, including all parks owned by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.

The authority’s busiest parks, now closed, include Wilacre Park in Studio City; Temescal Gateway Park in Pacific Palisades; Franklin Canyon Park off Mulholland Drive, Beverly Hills; Ed Davis Park in Towsley Canyon, the Santa Clarita Valley; all the overlooks on Mulholland Drive; Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve at the west end of Victory Boulevard; and Escondido Canyon Park in Malibu.



Ventura County

• Ventura County has allowed the opening of county-managed beaches, golf courses and bike shops among various modifications to its Stay Well at Home order. That order, which continues to close campgrounds, gyms, swimming pools and many other facilities, is effective through May 15.

•The city of Ventura on April 20 reopened its beaches, pier, promenade and parks, subject to requirements that people keep their distance and don’t linger.

• The city of Port Hueneme, experimenting with a “soft reopening,” has reopened its beach (and a parking lot) to walking, running, biking and solo surfing and paddleboarding, but said it would discourage sunbathing or any “stationary presence” on the sand. Its pier, restrooms, playground and street parking remain closed.



Orange County

On Saturday and Sunday, April 25 and 26, many of the county’s shores, especially Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, were so crowded that photographs alarmed many people, including the governor.

With his action Thursday, Newsom set in motion the “hard close” of Orange County’s local and state beaches.

Parking lots at all county beaches, regional and wilderness parks remain closed as well. So are parking spaces at all trailheads; parking lots at Irvine Lake; parking along Black Star Canyon Road; pedestrian access points at Thousand Steps, Table Rock, West, Camel Point and Treasure Island beaches; restrooms; playgrounds; exercise equipment; shelters and trailheads. Pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians were permitted.

Orange County also banned vehicular traffic to Carbon Canyon, Clark, Craig, Irvine, Laguna Niguel, Mason, Mile Square, Tri-City and Yorba regional parks. Pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians were permitted.

Orange County’s Supervisors have cleared the way for public and private golf courses to open.

Among individual Orange County coastal cities, north to south:

• Seal Beach had already closed its beach, pier and many park amenities. But green space within its parks remains accessible; social distancing is required.

Advertisement

• Huntington Beach’s pier and beach parking lots have been closed since late March, followed by closure of street parking along Pacific Coast Highway April 16 and closure of Huntington Harbor beaches on April 17. But some golf courses have reopened in recent days.

• Newport Beach, which had kept beaches open until Thursday, on March 25 closed its beachfront parking lots and piers, and later added its Oceanfront Boardwalk on the Balboa Peninsula and the Balboa Island Bayfront Walkway to the forbidden list.

• In Laguna Beach, closures cover all basketball, volleyball and tennis courts; all playgrounds; its community pool; parking lots at Aliso Beach; and three beach-adjacent city parks: Main Beach city park, Heisler city park and Treasure Island city park.

• In Dana Point, city, county and state beach and harbor public parking lots are closed, as is Dana Cove Beach and many coast-adjacent streets.

Advertisement

• San Clemente, which had reopened beaches on April 25, now must close them again. On April 1 it closed tennis courts, ball fields and picnic areas as well, but the city’s trails remained open.



Throughout Los Angeles County

The Safer at Home order from Los Angeles County Public Health officials, issued March 21 and updated April 10, prohibits all public and private group events and gatherings through May 15. It also says that individuals and families are not prohibited from “hiking, walking, biking or shopping at [e]ssential [b]usinesses,” as long as they keep their distance from others.

The order also notes that if local entities (such as municipal governments) choose to impose stricter limits, the county order does not supersede them.

Los Angeles County has closed all indoor and outdoor playgrounds, along with indoor shopping centers and all swap meets and flea markets.

• In San Bernardino County, the Mt. Baldy Resort reopened for skiers on Wednesday, saying its new limits would allow for proper social distancing.

• Also, San Bernardino County on April 25 reopened county parks, lakes, rivers and recreation areas. “Private and city-owned parks, trails, lakes and golf courses also opened on a limited basis,” the L.A. Times Luke Money reports. Big Morongo Canyon Preserve and Mojave River Forks Regional Park are still closed.

• Riverside County leaders on April 20 allowed golf courses to reopen, with restrictions. Hiking, bikes and horseback-riding on trails and in parks are also permitted under the county’s health order.



San Diego County parks and beaches

San Diego County Board of Supervisors reopened county-run beaches there April 27 to swimming, surfing, kayaking and paddle-boarding but not group activities, sunbathing or boating.

Advertisement

The cities of San Diego, Coronado and Oceanside have taken similar actions, as has the Port of San Diego, which controls 34 miles of the county’s waterfront. Most beach parking lots and boardwalks remain closed, as do state beaches.

In Carlsbad, Del Mar and Solana Beach, beaches remain closed until further notice. Del Mar’s City Council scheduled a meeting Friday afternoon to discuss the beaches.

Most of San Diego County’s parks and preserves have remained open for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians, but their parking lots and many facilities and amenities are closed.



National forests in Southern California

The U.S. Forest Service has closed campgrounds, picnic areas, bathrooms and other developed recreation sites in its California forests through May 15, leaving Southern California’s four forests — Angeles, Cleveland, Los Padres and San Bernardino — to make their own decisions on trail access and parking.

Advertisement

• In the Angeles National Forest, authorities on April 3 closed 23 well-used San Gabriel mountain trails, four popular trailheads and 19 roads.

This map shows the affected areas. The closures include the Millard Canyon above Altadena, San Antonio Falls, Icehouse Canyon and North Devil’s Backbone trailheads.

The forest order shuts routes to Echo Mountain and Mt. Lowe, such as the Sam Merrill Trail, above Altadena, as well as others leading to Mt. Wilson, San Gabriel Peak, the Rim Trail and other routes in the San Gabriel Mountains.

• In the San Bernardino National Forest, whose 680,000 acres include four mountain ranges in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, a spokesman said trails, trailheads, staging areas that function as trailheads and parking areas at trailheads remain open. Hikers should practice social distancing, sticking to wide fire roads instead of single-track trails that are too narrow, the spokesman said.

Advertisement

• In Los Padres National Forest, which includes about 1.95 million acres reaching north from Ventura County into Central California, spokesman Andrew Madsen said trailhead parking and trails remain open, as do dispersed camp sites in the backcountry.

• In Cleveland National Forest, which reaches into San Diego, Riverside and Orange counties, the list of sites closed includes all trails and picnic areas where an Adventure Pass is usually required.

In the forest’s Trabuco ranger district, closures include: El Cariso north/south picnic area; Hot Springs trailhead; San Juan loop trailhead; Tenaja trailhead; Trabuco creek picnic area; Wildomar staging area; Maple Springs day-use area.

In the forest’s Descanso Ranger District, closures include Agua Dulce; Bear Valley OHV (off-highway vehicle) area; and Corral Canyon.

['Emily Zemler'],2020-05-05,Rapman’s ‘Blue Story’ battles #BAFTAsoWhite and coronavirus on the way to the screen,"Rapman’s feature debut, “Blue Story,” met its share of hurdles on the way to the screen. The film, adapted from the writer-director’s three-part 2014 YouTube series of the same name, nearly lost its star weeks before production, was pulled from theaters in the U.K. last fall following a lobby brawl, got overlooked at the BAFTAs and lost its shot at a U.S. theatrical premiere due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But for Rapman, née Andrew Onwubolu, these challenges have only made the film’s success all that sweeter.

“I actually believe going forward people will start their own drama to get onto the news,” the London-based director reflects on the film’s controversial opening, speaking via Zoom alongside star Micheal Ward after the U.K. lockdown was put in place. “We were on the news every day for a week. ‘Blue Story’ was everywhere. It was the talk of the city. You couldn’t buy that type of press. It will go down in history. It was a blessing in disguise.”

For Rapman, who based the story of two best friends living in rival gang territories in South-East London on his own upbringing in Deptford and Peckham, “Blue Story” is ultimately about finding the light on the other side of overwhelming darkness. Looking back now, the director isn’t that concerned that the movie lost 30% of its screens during its first weekend in the U.K. thanks to a mass fight at a theater in Birmingham. The response from Vue and Showcase cinemas was criticized as an aggressive overreaction, with tinges of racism, but “Blue Story” came out the other side with a passionate audience.

“I always wanted to know what our opening weekend would have been,” Rapman notes. “Even though we probably made the numbers up because there was so much hype after that, I want to know, fair play, what would we have done that first weekend?”

Advertisement

Originally, Rapman’s aim was simply to depict the tragic reality of gang life in South London and to showcase how easily teenagers can get sucked into that culture based solely on their home address. His tale of two friends, Timmy and Marco, who are embroiled in rival gangs, reflects on a larger problem but refuses to be didactic. The director has left that lifestyle — and that neighborhood — behind and hopes others can do the same, but he also knows this is everyday life for a lot of young Londoners.

“That was my childhood,” Rapman says with a shrug. “When I was adapting it to the screen I still wasn’t thinking about international. I was thinking, ‘We need to make a real hood movie that is a bit more grounded in our time.’ Nothing’s been modern. [Other movies] don’t even mention Instagram. That’s what was missing to me. I just wanted to give the U.K. something classic. I knew, no matter what, with this film it was my destiny to tell that story.”

The director put up-and-comer Stephen Odubola in the role of Timmy and centered on Ward, who had recently been added to the cast of Netflix’s “Top Boy,” to play Marco. Two weeks before production was set to start, Netflix and the production company behind “Top Boy” refused to let Ward join the cast, fearful that the stories and roles were too similar. To persuade them, Ward wrote an impassioned letter that finally allowed for some flexibility in his contract with Netflix.

“I’m just so happy to be part of both,” the actor says. “I was able to tell real stories rooted in a real place that I’m from and I’m so proud of that. [‘Blue Story’ is] representing something that people know that they didn’t really have a voice for before. No one can really say they’ve seen something like ‘Blue Story.’ This is a lot more raw and — I feel — a lot more real than what’s come before. So the whole time you’re filming you’re thinking, ‘This is bigger than me.’ For me, it wasn’t just my first movie — it was bigger than that.”

The film, shot over 23 days for a modest budget of $1.6 million, substituted North London for South London because the actual boroughs refused to issue filming permits. It was the first feature for all of the main cast members. The budget was bigger than anything Rapman was used to, but it was still restrictive and the production ended up unable to do reshoots. Instead, Rapman edited in actual CCTV footage of gang fights found in the BBC archives, which augments its sense of realism. It’s the kind of movie that rarely comes out of the U.K., a film industry that’s not particularly known for its diversity — especially after January’s whitewashed BAFTA nominations — but already Rapman sees the change that “Blue Story” has brought.

“I’ve already heard about films getting greenlit on the back of the success of ‘Blue Story,’” he says. “I know people who have made a film and the studio said, ‘We’re ready to go ahead now because we’ve seen what “Blue Story” [had] done.’ Before this, they didn’t think these types of film have an audience or make money, but it’s all changed now. I think going forward loads of people are going to get their ‘Blue Story.’”

It’s also shifted things for Ward, who is patiently waiting for the lockdown to end so he can start filming the next season of “Top Boy.” Earlier this year, Ward won the BAFTA Rising Star Award, an accolade that was especially notable due to the lack of diversity in the other BAFTA nominees and films. The British Academy Film Awards failed to nominate “Blue Story” for best British film despite its box office success and strong reviews (and a lot of expectation from the press).

“We don’t have a voice in these rooms so of course we’re going to get shunned,” Ward reflects. “I don’t know who in those rooms could have watched ‘Blue Story’ like that, but regardless if we had more people in that room who were, not even black, just people who were interested in different topics and realizing how powerful other people’s work can be, then it would have been a different story.”

“I was upset by that, but it also didn’t matter,” Rapman says. “It didn’t take away from the success that ‘Blue Story’ has had. Micheal won and that win is connected to ‘Blue Story.’ And ‘Blue Story’ was in the conversation. I don’t live for the awards, but I do feel like it deserved it only because we went through so much. We done the numbers. We made the money. We got good reviews. What else does it have to do to make it? But it can’t take away from what the film achieved and a BAFTA did come out it.”

Now “Blue Story” gets to add to its legacy by traveling to the U.S. as well as Canada — on VOD rather than into theaters as planned. It’s a story that’s inherently specific to London, but its emotions and feelings are universal.

“Americans can look at this now and see a slice of life that they never really witnessed before,” Ward says. “That is a beautiful thing.”

“It’s the same reaction for the movie everywhere,” Rapman adds. “It’s a proud thing to see that our cultures are so close together. We might sound a bit different, we might use different slang, but Crips and Bloods, Ghetto Boys and Peckham — street gangs are street gangs.

The CNN anchor stopped by “The Late Show” on Monday night, where host Stephen Colbert thanked him for “giving all of us something joyful to see” during these somber times as the world is still reeling from the coronavirus crisis. Cooper announced the birth of his child, Wyatt Morgan Cooper, last week.

During the interview Cooper shared that he is co-parenting his son with his ex Benjamin Maisani as he reflected on being present for Wyatt’s birth less than a year after being with his mother, fashion entrepreneur Gloria Vanderbilt, as she died.

“My mom died in June, so it hasn’t even been a full year,” said Cooper. “To have experienced the loss of her life and to have been there with her when she breathed her last breath and to witness that and to be holding her at that time, and then to suddenly ... be in a delivery room with this amazing surrogate and her husband and my former partner Benjamin ... and to see a new human being come into existence, which I’d never seen in person before, it was just extraordinary.”

Cooper clarified that although they will be co-parenting, he and Maisani are not back together.

“But he’s my family and I want him to be Wyatt’s family as well,” explained Cooper. News of the couple’s split surfaced in 2018 after they had been together for three years.

Cooper also told Colbert his friend and TV host Andy Cohen has been a big help during this time. Cohen’s son, Benjamin, was born last year.

“He’s actually really helped me because my son is entirely wearing hand-me-downs from Andy Cohen’s son,” said Cooper.

Cooper explained initially he planned on going shopping — something he hates to do — but because of the pandemic was considering looking for baby clothes online. But “it just seemed weird. So, he just gave me all the clothes,” he said.

Hand-me-down baby clothes is not the only thing Wyatt has inherited from his future pal. Cohen explained on his SiriusXM show on Monday that his son’s former nanny is now Wyatt’s nanny.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-05-05/anderson-cooper-baby-wyatt-co-parenting

Andrew Onwubolu) wields words and images the way his young characters use weapons and fists to taunt, cajole, provoke and hurt one another. It’s a Shakespearean rhapsody in indigo where love, friendship, betrayal and revenge swirl and blur with life-changing consequences.

Based on Rapman’s life in South-East London and his 2014 YouTube series, it’s a cautionary tale of two boys — Timmy and Marco — who are fast friends from the first day Timmy’s mom sends him from their home in Deptford to a better school in Peckham. When the boys rocket from age 11 to 15 before the end of the opening credits, we know we are in for a wild ride and a different style of filmmaking.

As Timmy (Stephen Odubola) and Marco (Micheal Ward) navigate typical aspects of high school — homework, girls, hanging out — they are buffeted by larger forces, namely the daily clashes of the Caribbean and African gangs that rule Peckham and nearby Lewisham. The boys’ friendship is further challenged by their close ties to that decades-old conflict through Timmy’s old primary school friend Kiron (who now goes by Killy and is played by Khali Best) and Marco’s brother Switcher (Eric Kofi-Abrefa), both upper echelon gang members on opposite sides.

This is not just an area where black lives matter, they are virtually all that exist, save for the occasional police raid. The rival gangs identify targets based simply on the shade of skin — light vs. dark — and for crossing into the wrong postal code. The violence happens quickly, flash decisions causing repercussions that ripple across families and neighborhoods.

“Blue Story’s” cast, including a standout turn by Karla-Simone Spencer as Timmy’s sweet love interest Leah, brings a fierce, adrenaline-fueled authenticity to their roles. Odubola and Ward are asked to walk a fine line, just as Timmy and Marco do, between innocence and experience. Their downfalls are both credible and heartbreaking.

Though in English, the film is subtitled to convey the heavily accented patois spoken by the characters. It lends a musicality that makes the entire script feel like it’s in verse. Food and culture — both pop and local — are also used to bring the streets alive as a place people actually live … and die.

As the onscreen, rhyme-slinging narrator, Rapman layers tragedy upon tragedy, with the localized authority of a Bruce Springsteen. Where Springsteen injects his songs with a cinematic quality, Rapman does the reverse, using the beats of his music to propel the visuals and storytelling style.

In the end, it’s the underlying inevitability of the violence that feels like the real crime. Chronicling the factionalism, the posturing and the never-ending cycle of reprisals, “Blue Story” is really just asking, is any of it really worth dying for?",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-05-05/blue-story-review-rapman-london

The class-action lawsuit, Watson vs. the University of Southern California, alleges that USC is unlawfully refusing to refund all or part of students’ spring 2020 tuition, fees and meal plans, “despite the dramatically lower quality and less valuable education and services now being provided,” according to the complaint, which was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California.

“Essentially, students have paid Defendants for access to buildings they can no longer enter, technology the University is not providing, activities that are not available, and meals that will never be served,” the complaint says. “USC is thus profiting from COVID-19 while further burdening students and their families.”

The lawsuit against USC follows others filed against the University of California and California State University last week alleging that the university systems owe millions of dollars to students who can no longer use health facilities, student centers and other services paid for by fees.

Provost Charles F. Zukoski announced last week that USC would not provide partial tuition refunds for spring or summer sessions. He said the university did provide prorated housing and dining fee refunds to students who vacated university housing.

USC said that it was “disappointed” by the lawsuit but that the university took “extraordinary steps” to maintain the educational experience for students.

“USC pivoted immediately to deliver quality instruction in an online format,” the university said. “Faculty and staff have worked tirelessly to connect with students to ensure that academic work continues on track and that progress toward the completion of a USC degree continues.”

The suit against USC alleges breach of contract and unfair business practices, among other things, on behalf of an estimated 40,000 students who paid tuition and fees for in-person education during the spring 2020 term and did not receive those services or adequate refunds.

The lead plaintiff, Latisha Watson, is a master’s of social work student who lives off campus and doesn’t own a car, according to the complaint. She took out loans to pay $21,886.38 in tuition and fees for the spring semester, including $675 for a meal plan she can no longer use and for which she received no partial refund. The lawsuit seeks, for her and for other members of the class, a refund of the unused portion of meal plan fees and of a percentage of tuition.

“Despite receiving [an] influx of federal funds, Defendants refuse to refund or reimburse Plaintiff and similarly-situated USC students,” the lawsuit says.

USC will receive more than $19 million in federal aid through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. At least half of the funds must be spent directly on emergency aid for students. The other half may be used for institutional costs resulting from disruptions caused by the COVID-`19 pandemic, including reimbursing the university for refunds issued to students for room and board, tuition and other fees, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Education.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/usc-sued-over-refusal-to-reimburse-tuition-fees

The school’s experimental “Return to Learn” program will begin May 11, when UC San Diego starts giving self-administered tests to 5,000 students who are living in campus housing.

If the program works, campus officials plan to test about 65,000 students, faculty and staff on a monthly basis.

UC San Diego will become the first campus in the University of California system and one of the first in the U.S. to broadly test students for the coronavirus — an undertaking it is well-suited to do. It operates UC San Diego Health, which includes two major hospitals and many clinics, all which are tied to one of the largest medical research programs in the U.S.

“This effort will leverage the ingenuity and expertise of our clinicians, molecular biologists, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians and others to work toward a tailored map of where the virus is, and where it isn’t,” Khosla said in a statement.

“We expect these efforts to help put us in the best possible position to minimize virus outbreaks and implement new interventions as needed, should we resume in-person activities this fall.”

Like other schools, UC San Diego was forced to shift to online classes in March and April as the novel coronavirus spread. The shift has been unpopular with many students, some of whom say that in-person classes offer a much richer learning experience. Students also don’t like paying full tuition for online classes.

The change is causing financial devastation.

Khosla said last week that COVID-19 has cost UC San Diego $150 million so far, and that it is likely to cost an additional $200 million to $300 million by the end of the summer.

Some of the losses stem from the refunds the university had to issue to students who lived in campus housing. At the start of the fall quarter, about 15,000 students lived on campus — a figure that Khosla says could drop below 13,000 this fall due to social distancing rules.

The school — which has been experiencing unprecedented growth for more than a decade — also could lose enrollment due to the public’s fear of the virus. UC San Diego began the fall quarter with nearly 39,000 students, a record.

The Return to Learn program is meant to address that anxiety.

UC San Diego officials said Tuesday that 5,000 undergraduate and graduate residential students will be given nasal swab-based coronavirus tests initially, and that it will check housing wastewater and surface collections for signs of the virus.

Students “will go to one of several designated sites on campus to pick up a clean nasal swab in a specimen collection container,” the university said in a statement. “Using a downloaded barcode-reader app on a smartphone, the participant will scan the unique barcode on the container, linking their cellphone number to the specimen and generating a time stamp.

“The participant will then swab the inside of their own nose, drop the swab in the container and leave it in a collection box to be picked up by program coordinators. The swabs will be tested for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at the Center for Advanced Laboratory Medicine at UC San Diego Health.”

The university expects to produce test results within roughly 24 hours. Campuswide testing could begin in early September if the program works.

If a person tests positive, the student will be notified and referred to a public health team that will determine whether the participant has been in close contact with other people, UC San Diego said. Any infected students who are shedding the virus will be given dedicated campus housing where they can self-isolate until they’re no longer infectious.

The Bay Area Native Is A Graduate Of Uc Berkeley', 'Started At The Los Angeles Times In']",2020-05-05,"Lifting stay-at-home order too soon would cause more deaths, Northern California officials say","Santa Clara County’s executive officer cautioned Tuesday against moving quickly to lift the shelter-in-place order.

The death toll in California is still going up at significant numbers, Dr. Jeffrey Smith told the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors Tuesday. A Times analysis showed that 495 coronavirus deaths were reported statewide in the seven-day period that ended on Sunday. While the weekly death toll represented a 9% decrease compared to the previous week, it also represented nearly one-quarter of the state’s death toll up to that point.

“You can still see that it’s still gone up pretty significantly in recent times,” Smith said. “There’s a lot of talk in California about relaxing shelter-in-place [orders]. I just want to point out that we’re still, in California, going up dramatically. So there’s no clinical evidence that shelter-in-place [orders] should be relaxed at this point.”

Echoing statements by other medical experts, Smith said loosening up the stay-at-home orders will result in more infections and deaths.

Advertisement

With many states now significantly relaxing stay-at-home orders, Smith noted the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is now forecasting a national death toll of more than 134,000 by early August, close to double the current total of 70,000. The institute now forecasts a California death toll of 4,700 by early August, also roughly double of California’s current number of more than 2,300.

Dr. George Rutherford, a UC San Francisco epidemiologist and infectious disease expert, said on KGO-TV that the institute’s estimates so far have been spot-on.

Separately, a private projection by the Trump administration forecasts the daily death toll nationwide to rise to about 3,000 a day on June 1, the New York Times reported. The average daily death toll nationally last week was 1,800 fatalities a day.

Such a daily death toll would be staggering, Rutherford said. “Just remember, 3,000 deaths per day is 90,000 deaths per month. There were 56,000 Americans who died in Vietnam; 44,000 that died in the Korean War, and that was spread out over years,” he said.

“Relaxing shelter-in-place will cause new people to die,” Smith said. “Relaxation that’s more rapid and more widespread will be more risky.”

So far, Santa Clara County has joined five other Bay Area counties in implementing one of the nation’s strictest shelter-in-place orders, and has opted for an extremely slow loosening of the rules. While construction in L.A. County was never ordered halted, the Bay Area had put brakes on most construction, a restriction that was repealed in a new health order on Monday. The Bay Area’s stay-at-home order has been extended to May 31.

Dr. Sara Cody, the Santa Clara County health officer, said the Bay Area’s most populous county is seeing cases and hospitalizations flatten or decrease, and has ample hospital bed capacity. But the county still does not have an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, like masks, gowns and gloves, only one-fifth of the needed testing capacity, and needs to do more to increase the county’s capability to investigate new illnesses.

When asked if the governor’s announcement about the statewide loosening of stay-at-home orders would affect the Bay Area, Cody said health officials were still seeking more specifics from the state as to what’s allowed to be opened.

One elected official, Santa Clara County supervisor Mike Wasserman, expressed concern about the potential duration of the shelter-in-place order and said he hoped all small businesses — from barber shops to jewelry stores — can be allowed to reopen as soon as possible.

“We can’t shelter in place forever,” Wasserman told health officials. “We do know if we don’t let more people go back to work sooner than later, our economy will effectively go on life support.”

County officials asked for more patience, saying increasing testing and disease investigating capabilities are crucial before weakening stay-at-home orders further.

“We’re working really hard because we do know that many, many in our community are suffering from the economy and the social isolation of being at home. So I hear you loud and clear. And I am worried, too,” Cody said.

Smith added that sticking with the shelter-in-place order longer the first time may end up being the better move, not only from a health perspective, but also from an economic one.

During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, while Philadelphia moved too slowly to deal with rising flu outbreaks, St. Louis acted far more quickly, closing many public places swiftly, and, “strangely enough, their economy came back faster than Philadelphia,” Smith said.

A recent study found that cities that moved more aggressively to close down the city as the flu hit experienced a better economic recovery afterward. “It’s never an either-or, it’s always how do you accomplish both good goals. And we’ve got two good goals,” Smith said.

Smith said this pandemic is one of only four worldwide in the past 102 years, and the only one in modern history caused by a coronavirus, a type of virus that until now has been associated with the common cold.

In just a matter of a few months, 256,000 people who have been infected with the coronavirus have died, while the 1957-58 flu pandemic killed 1.1 million people; the 1968 flu pandemic resulted in 1 million deaths and the 1918 pandemic resulted in 50 million dead worldwide.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/lifting-stay-at-home-order-too-soon-would-cause-more-deaths-northern-california-officials-say

The video shows the woman, who was spotted by lifeguards walking her unleashed dog Friday on a beach in Ocean Beach, taken to the ground twice by officers and handcuffed, once on the sand and once on asphalt.



For the record: Because of incorrect information provided by San Diego police, this story originally misstated when dogs are prohibited on San Diego beaches. Dogs can be on beaches until 9 a.m.

The video is more than nine minutes long and ends after the woman is placed into a patrol car. She is wearing a white, one-piece bathing suit and appears to be barefoot.

At one point in the video, an officer can be heard telling a bystander: “Just go away.”

The woman, while being handcuffed for the second time, tells the bystander: “No, don’t go away ... film that.”

Councilwoman Monica Montgomery issued a statement Monday calling for “equity in enforcement” after viewing the video on social media. She asked police leaders and the mayor’s office to look into the matter.

“The footage is particularly concerning and disturbing, as this incident occurred on the heels of protests that clearly violated the public health orders. No arrests were made,” Montgomery, chair of the city’s Committee on Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods, said in a statement. “My office is demanding answers as to why this young woman did not receive equitable enforcement and treatment.”

Montgomery said she did not know the woman or details about the incident but said she thought the way the woman was treated was troubling.

“I have been concerned since my campaign about equitable enforcement in the city of San Diego,” she said.

She said bringing the issue to the “public eye” and discussing it could help improve the situation.

Police officials said the 36-year-old woman was walking in an area where unleashed dogs are prohibited from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. They said the woman refused to talk with lifeguards and police and tried to walk past them.

She was arrested on suspicion of being drunk in public and resisting arrest after she slipped off her handcuffs twice, officials said. She was booked into jail after she was turned away from detox for being uncooperative.

“The San Diego Police Department has a strict non-bias-based policing policy and does not tolerate policing based on factors such as race, gender or national origin,” according to the statement.

Several people who watched the video noted that others who were unmasked and walking dogs in the area were not cited by police, said Francine Maxwell, president of the local NAACP chapter. Maxwell said the “same old problems” remain as residents try to follow health orders requiring facial coverings and keeping six feet apart in public areas.

“Over this past week, the NAACP San Diego branch has become greatly concerned about what appears to be racial discrimination by law enforcement in enforcing the social distancing mandate,” she said in a statement. “In San Diego, we reviewed a video of an African American female aggressively detained by police officers while walking her dog on the beach — while other beachgoers with their dogs were allowed to enjoy their day.”

Last month, Maxwell said she witnessed her own father, who is black and has dementia, being approached by a police van that “jumped the curb” as he was walking alone in a park when parks were closed. Two days later, local protesters, many not wearing masks or following social distancing rules, were allowed to demonstrate in downtown without being cited.

“I am left ... wondering just what it was that made those officers feel that jumping a curb and driving up on a lone pedestrian was a sensible way to enforce a public health measure,” she wrote at the time. “Was their need to enforce their will on a black man really that strong? There was no need to charge their vans into the ‘Freedom Rally’ two days later, so we have to wonder.”

As for Friday’s incident, Maxwell said several people who have seen the video have questioned the “roughness of the arrest” and wondered why a female officer wasn’t called to assist. “Bystanders were offended by the way she was being flipped around,” she added.

Officials said they will review the conduct of officers involved in the arrest to determine if any policies were violated.

Ahn, a Stanford graduate who made an exhilarating run to the fourth round of the U.S. Open last year, is winning raves from fellow players for the creative, tennis-themed videos she has been posting on TikTok and Instagram. Whether lip-syncing to famous songs, projecting herself into the umpire’s chair while scolding a rowdy crowd at a match, dressing in Wimbledon whites to hit in the backyard of her parents’ New Jersey home or lovingly inhaling the scent of a freshly opened can of tennis balls, Ahn has kept herself and her fans laughing.

“I always used to walk around with a camera on me, so I was always recording and putting together little videos. So there’s not that much footage of me growing up. It’s mostly of my friends, and I’ve got tons of blackmail on them,” she said jokingly during a recent phone conversation. “This is probably one of the first real times that I’ve put myself in front of the camera, and people are seeing that. I’m just really happy that people find it entertaining.”

Beyond providing a few minutes’ amusement, her videos have become a useful tool in getting people through these strange days.

Ahn has become concerned about the mental well-being of players who are experiencing anxiety or losing motivation since their normal life and livelihood were taken away from them, and she’s trying to help. Using her position on the Women’s Tennis Assn.'s Players’ Council, Ahn has been urging the WTA to remind players that the tour — which has suspended events through July 13 — offers mental health resources to guide them through this unprecedented time.

A laugh or attentive conversation can pierce their isolation and lift their spirits, Ahn believes, and she’s leading by example.

“I think everyone is trying to help each other as best they can in whatever capacity, whether that’s posting videos or reaching out to players individually,” she said. “I saw the morale at Indian Wells the day after the cancellation. There were still players going out and practicing. There were players doing fitness on the field but it was the weirdest atmosphere because everyone realized that Miami [the next tournament] was on hinges. We realized this could be the turning point, and all of a sudden the question is, ‘What am I doing this for? Why am I practicing? Why am I training?’ Now we’re in May and that question still applies.

“What’s so tough about the quarantine is not only the physical restrictions of staying inside or keeping your walks to a minimum, but also the mental toll that it takes because of the uncertainty. There’s no guarantee. We’re planning to come back in July. There’s no guarantee that’s going to happen. Originally we were supposed to come back in May. That got pushed to June, which is now July, and at some point I think the morale really takes a hit.

“It’s important to just try to take care of players at this time because we’ve just never been here before. Everyone’s got to band together and help everyone.”

Ahn rose to a career-best ranking of No. 87 last September, when she reached the round of 16 at the U.S. Open for the first time in her career, and she was 96th in the world when competition was put on hold. She was hoping 2020 would be a breakout year. Instead, like everyone else, she’s in limbo.

“It’s very frustrating for me because being top 100, you get that extra perk of getting into main draw Slams on your own. I got a wild card into Indian Wells main draw for the first time, which obviously is one of the best tournaments of the year from everyone’s perspective,” said Ahn, who will be 28 in June. “I played the $125,000 tournament the week before and I felt I had some momentum going into Indian Wells, so I was super-excited to play, then all of a sudden everyone is just on a full stop.

“I guess I’m fortunate — or unfortunate, however you want to look at it — to be very busy in these meetings with the WTA.”

Dampeners: Here for a good time, not a long time pic.twitter.com/jRCBFVtP5z — Kristie Ahn (@kristieahn) April 20, 2020

Those meetings got a happy jolt recently when 20-time Grand Slam singles champion Roger Federer tweeted this would be a good time for the separate men’s and women’s tours to unite as one organization. The women have long advocated that but the ATP men’s tour has resisted.

“That pretty much struck the whole of tennis Twitter. We were very excited to see that because all of a sudden that puts some validation on it,” Ahn said. “It’s public. One of the top players, Roger Federer tweeted about it. That must mean something.

“It’s out there now. This is the time to do it. We have the time. We can use it to our advantage and the tours can hopefully go in the same direction and we can see a better product come out of it in the end.”

Playing a part in making that happen would enhance Ahn’s already impressive resume. She’s near the end of her tennis career, she said, though she’s not sure what’s next. The sport would be fortunate if she takes on an administrative role.

With a new deal to televise Korean league games, ESPN trumpeted the return of baseball, the anchor of the preceding “SportsCenter” program introducing the opening day contest between the Samsung Lions and the NC Dinos by declaring, “Live sports is back.”

Well, almost.

Rain was falling in the city of Daegu, the resulting delay prompting an interview with former Korean Baseball Organization MVP and current major leaguer Eric Thames to be clumsily stretched to nearly 20 minutes.

Advertisement

The game, in which the Dinos prevailed 4-0, didn’t represent a step toward normalcy as much as it did the desperation that has swept over the United States.

Originally scheduled to start at 1 a.m. on the East Coast, the game could have cured the most severe case of insomnia. Talk about a non-habit-forming sleep aid.

The absence of a crowd didn’t help. More critical was how the American audience knew nearly nothing about the contestants. Combat sports can overcome such a lack of familiarity. The possibility that a fellow human being could be injured or killed can be enough to convince a neutral observer to become emotionally engaged. Baseball doesn’t have that luxury. Remove the reservoir of thoughts and feeling developed over multiple generations and what remains is a slow-paced game in which spectators have no rooting interests or story lines to follow.

This was entirely expected, but, as the cliché goes, desperate times call for desperate measures.

Desperate for viewers when the country is shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak, ESPN gambled that enough sports fans are desperate for live competition that they will drastically change their sleep schedules and form a niche audience. Three of the six games that will be televised every week start at 2:30 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time.

The network’s ongoing documentary series on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls has feasted on this hunger. The shows include previously unseen footage but otherwise don’t break ground. The series has nonetheless received fawning reviews from journalists, who sound as if they are auditioning for roles as ESPN publicists.

If the sports industrial complex has a vested interest in making “The Last Dance” appear as if it’s a transcendent event, their customers do too. It helps them maintain sanity in a period of extreme uncertainty. The collective anxiety is based in the very nature of the virus, as well as apprehension over the reliability of information. There are varying opinions over how to best navigate this pandemic. Some are politically based, but some aren’t.

Major League Baseball couldn’t properly handle a sign-stealing scandal. What makes anyone think Commissioner Rob Manfred can navigate a season around a global pandemic?

Maybe some of the speculative stories about baseball returning are based in reality. Maybe spring training can start next month and the season a month after that. Whatever the case, skepticism over motives and a convoluted informational landscape promise to make the road particularly complicated. Opening day feels distant.

Until then, the country will have to settle for this, the retelling of a well-known basketball story and baseball from a second-rate league that can serve as lullabies for adults.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-05-05/billing-korean-baseball-as-return-of-live-sports-on-tv-a-stretch

Korver, who shares the UCLA career record for made three-pointers with 256, played for the Bruins from 2012 to 2017, missing one season because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee.

After playing one season professionally in Europe, the former Bruins captain became an assistant coach at Northern Colorado University in 2018. During her first season on the bench, the Bears made their first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. The 2018-19 season was cut short in March by the coronavirus outbreak.

Korver was a three-time All-CIF player at Cerritos Valley Christian before tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee as a senior.

['Associated Press'],2020-05-05,Rafael Nadal is ready to cancel this tennis season and move on to 2021,"If given the option, Rafael Nadal said he would scrap this season entirely so tennis could resume normally in 2021.

The second-ranked Spaniard, who is 33 years old and has won 19 Grand Slam titles, said he hoped to resume playing this year but doubted it could happen because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“I would sign up right now just to being ready for 2021,” Nadal said in interviews with El Pais and other Spanish newspapers published Tuesday. “I’m more concerned with the Australian Open than with what happens later this year. I think 2020 has been practically lost. I’m hopeful of being able to start next year.”

Nadal said the logistical difficulties of having to move people from country to country for tournaments make it hard for tennis to resume safely amid the pandemic.

“Sadly, I’m not going to lie to you, the feeling is that we are losing a year of our lives,” Nadal said. “And at 33, 34 years old, that is more valuable than at 20, when you have more time ahead of you.”

Nadal recently said he was concerned with the risk of new injuries when players return to action after a long time without proper training. The Spaniard has had to deal with a series of injuries throughout his career and expects his body to struggle again when competitions finally resume.

Nadal also complained about “confusing” information regarding the return to practice of tennis players in Spain. He said he went to train on a private court because it wasn’t clear to him whether he could practice normally after the government eased some of the lockdown measures that have been in place in the country since mid-March.

Professional and high-performance athletes have been allowed to resume practicing at any time this week, but sports facilities and training centers are to remain closed, with some exceptions for soccer clubs and a few other sports.

Novak Djokovic apparently broke confinement rules on Monday for going onto a tennis court at a club in the Spanish city of Marbella. The tennis federation had said players are not yet allowed to practice on courts.

He Previously Wrote About The Russia Investigation.']",2020-05-05,Trump pick for spy chief grilled at Senate hearing,"Last summer, President Trump’s choice for national intelligence director, Rep. John Ratcliffe, appeared doomed in the Senate, where even Republicans worried that his lack of national security experience and his exaggerated resume made him unfit to oversee the nation’s 17 spy agencies.

Trump withdrew Ratcliffe’s name from consideration in less than a week.

But Trump backtracked and renominated Ratcliffe as director of national intelligence early this year, and the Texas Republican appears likely to win confirmation to one of the most important jobs in Washington. After a Tuesday morning hearing in the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), the panel’s chair, said he hopes to hold a vote next week.

“There were no questions that he sidestepped today,” Burr said. “He answered everything and I think he did a very successful job at, one, verifying that he’s more than capable of this job, and two, will serve in an independent capacity.”

Democrats did not share that assessment about Ratcliffe, who drew national attention as an outspoken defender of Trump during the Russia investigation and impeachment proceedings.

“I don’t see what has changed since last summer when the president decided not to proceed with your nomination over concerns about your inexperience, partisanship and past statements that seemed to embellish your record,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the panel’s vice chair.

Warner suggested that his Republican colleagues were advancing Ratcliffe’s nomination only because they are eager to replace Richard Grenell, a fierce Trump partisan who has been acting DNI while still serving as U.S. ambassador to Germany. Warner told Ratcliffe that some senators believe his “main qualification for this post is you are not Ambassador Grenell.”

In his testimony, Ratcliffe pledged to remain independent and to share unwelcome assessments with Trump, who forced out the previous national intelligence director, Dan Coats, after a series of clashes.

“I will deliver the unvarnished truth,” Ratcliffe said. “It won’t be shaded for anyone.”

But he labored to avoid contradicting Trump at the hearing. Only after three senators pressed him did Ratcliffe say he disagreed with the president’s claim that U.S. intelligence agencies — which he would oversee if confirmed — had “run amok.”

Ratcliffe said he couldn’t yet assess other high-profile threats and disputes that would fall under his purview.

He wouldn’t say wheter Iran had complied with the 2015 nuclear disarmament deal, which Trump abandoned, although U.S. agencies and United Nations monitors concluded that it had.

Nor would Ratcliffe say whether North Korea had made any progress toward giving up its nuclear weapons, the goal of Trump’s diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang. U.S. agencies say the country continues to expand its nuclear capability, although it has suspended underground tests.

Ratcliffe dodged when asked if Russia sought to help Trump win the 2016 election, as U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed and the president has adamantly denied.

Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee cast doubt on that assessment, which was released in the closing days of President Obama’s administration, while the Senate Intelligence Committee supported the conclusion in a recent bipartisan report.

“I respect both committees,” Ratcliffe said.

Ratcliffe said he agreed that the Kremlin had meddled in the U.S. election, something Trump has sometimes questioned.

“They have a goal of sowing discord and they have been successful in sowing discord,” he said.

The hearing showed how the coronavirus crisis has reshaped Washington. Senators were asked to watch from their offices and only come to the committee room to directly question Ratcliffe, who sat on the opposite side of the room.

Several senators wore masks, lowering them to ask questions during the hearing. Ratcliffe did not wear a mask.

Burr said the next DNI faced special challenges protecting national security during the pandemic.

“Countries around the world have locked down,” he said. “But those threats have not stopped.”

The White House has asked intelligence agencies to help determine whether the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory, a claim that could escalate fraught tensions between Washington and Beijing.

Trump recently said he’s seen evidence supporting the theory, but neither he nor national security officials have revealed any evidence. U.S. scientists have largely discounted that claim.

Ratcliffe said only that he would continue to examine the issue if confirmed.

“The intelligence community will be laser focused on getting all of the answers that we can regarding how this happened,” he said.

An Illinois native, Ratcliffe served eight years as mayor of Heath, Texas, a small town east of Dallas. In 2007, President George W. Bush named him acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Texas, a post he held for a year before returning to private practice.

Ratcliffe was elected to Congress in 2014 and joined the House Intelligence Committee in 2019. After Trump sought to name Ratcliffe as spy chief last summer, news reports highlighted discrepancies in his resume.

His campaign website said that, as a federal prosecutor he “personally managed dozens of international and domestic terrorism investigations involving some of the nation’s most sensitive security matters” and “put terrorists in prison.”

"['Sacramento Bureau Chief', 'John Myers Joined The Los Angeles Times As Sacramento Bureau Chief In', 'Has Spent More Than Two Decades Covering California Politics', 'State Government']",2020-05-04,Newsom administration refuses to divulge nearly $1-billion contract for coronavirus masks,"Attorneys for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration refused Monday to reveal the contents of a $990-million contract for purchasing protective masks from a Chinese electric car manufacturer, even though millions of the masks have already arrived in California to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a letter responding to a public records request from the Los Angeles Times, the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services insisted the contract with BYD does not have to be made public, despite similar requests made by members of the Legislature since Newsom announced the deal last month.

“Cal OES determined all responsive records are exempt from disclosure, including exemptions for records reflecting attorney work product, attorney-client privileged information, or other information exempt from disclosure under federal or state law,” Ryan Gronsky, an attorney with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, wrote in a letter to The Times.

Newsom first touted the deal for the company to sell the state a combination of N95 protective masks and more traditional surgical masks during an April 7 appearance on MSNBC.

“We decided enough’s enough,” the governor said to host Rachel Maddow of the state’s need to ensure protective masks could be acquired for emergency responders. “Let’s use the power, the purchasing power of the state of California, as a nation-state.”

A Cal OES spokesman said the agreement calls for the purchase of 200 million masks a month — including 150 million of the N95 variety — and would be in effect for at least two months. But all other details, including the price paid per mask, have been kept confidential.

The Times asked for all documents related to the BYD contract the day after Newsom’s TV appearance. Lawmakers have also requested additional details. Under provisions of emergency legislation ratified in March before the Legislature suspended operations due to the public health crisis, advisors to Newsom were required to give 72 hours notice before authorizing spending on coronavirus-related items. But for the contract with BYD to obtain masks, the administration said action had to be taken even faster.

“Under normal circumstances, the Legislature would have had more time to deliberate an expenditure of this magnitude and would have been allowed to thoroughly vet the details of the contract before proceeding,” state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles) wrote in an April 9 letter to Newsom’s budget director.

In the weeks since, legislators have frequently asked why they’ve been denied access to the contract. Administration officials have insisted disclosure could jeopardize the delivery of the masks, a concern repeated in Monday’s letter to The Times.

“Publishing the agreement now — before performance under the contract is complete — would introduce substantial and unnecessary risk to the State’s ability to secure necessary supplies,” Gronsky wrote.

The first installment of masks arrived last weekend in Los Angeles. A spokesman for Cal OES said Monday that more than 10 million surgical masks have now been delivered. The N95 masks, he said, still are awaiting safety approval by federal officials.

BYD announced in March that it was retooling its Shenzhen vehicle facility to produce masks and hand sanitizer. The company has a U.S. subsidiary headquartered in Los Angeles County, whose executives were touted by state officials as integral to the deal. To date, the state has paid a BYD-affiliated company almost $600 million.

Asked on April 18 about his administration’s refusal to disclose the document, Newsom said he looked forward to “all those details becoming public very, very shortly.” Repeating a promise that the BYD deal could also produce enough protective masks for other states, the governor dismissed concerns about the lack of transparency.

“Some are consumed by process, personality, intrigue, who’s up, who’s down?” Newsom said. “We are for actually solving a major, major problem. Not only for the state, but potentially a template for the country.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-04/gavin-newsom-will-not-release-california-coronavirus-masks-byd-contract

Seven weeks after public health concerns brought the work of the Legislature to a sudden halt, only members of the Assembly are returning to Sacramento this week, with the Senate choosing to do so on May 11. And even then, neither house is planning to reconvene for final votes on bills until June — in large part because of the challenges for adequate physical distancing posed by the tightly placed desks for legislators in the chambers of the Senate and Assembly.

“I know it’s going to be a very different way of doing business. But I think it was important for us to be here, to start thinking about the great challenges that we have ahead,” Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) said during the day’s first event, an Assembly hearing on healthcare issues.

Access to the historic statehouse remained limited. Those who were not legislators or staff members had their temperatures checked at the building’s entrance. Elevators were limited to a single occupant — an easy rule to follow on Monday, given the Capitol’s emptiness, but impossible during most springtime workdays, when dozens of hearings and events are usually scheduled.

“The work of the Legislature is essential for democracy, but preserving people’s health as we do that is of the highest importance,” Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) said in a statement. “We have spent the past six weeks developing a way to continue government with maximum safety.”

Assembly members were advised by Dr. Peter Beilenson, director of Sacramento’s County Department of Health Services, to be screened for the novel coronavirus before returning Monday.

“To protect both the legislators when they gather and the public who will be attending, I recommended that they get tested,” he said in an interview.

Because asymptomatic people can still transmit the virus, Beilenson said, all lawmakers and staff should contact their private physicians to arrange coronavirus tests, even if they are not showing symptoms.

“Anyone testing positive should isolate themselves at home for 14 days,” Beilenson wrote in a memo to the Assembly. “Of course, any legislator or staff that falls in the high-risk groups (65-plus and/or chronic underlying health conditions) should follow the guidance of their healthcare provider in terms of their decision about whether or not they should attend the session.”

Some lawmakers, including Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), have balked at getting a test when many other members of the public, including healthcare workers, have not yet been checked for the virus. Gonzalez said she asked for a clear directive from Beilenson’s office that she could give to her doctor, but she has not received one.

“As such, I do not meet our county’s criteria for testing and will not ask to be pushed to the front of the line,” Gonzalez said. “If I am required to get tested in Sacramento, exhibit any symptoms or am exposed to a COVID-19-positive individual, I will do so.”

Age is one risk factor among the 120 members of the Legislature. Thirteen members of the Senate are 65 or older, while 10 in that age group serve in the Assembly.

California had more than 55,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,200 deaths tied to the virus as of Monday afternoon, according to data collected by The Times. A spokesman for Rendon said his office has not heard of any Assembly member testing positive for COVID-19.

Six Assembly members asked for, and were granted, an excused absence from traveling to Sacramento due to age or underlying health conditions. One of them, Assemblyman Bill Quirk (D-Hayward), sent a letter to Rendon asking for consideration to vote remotely on bills.

“We see individuals, despite taking the best of precautions, getting infected,” Quirk said on Friday. “This is concerning.”

But legislative lawyers think a 2016 constitutional amendment, approved by voters, makes that untenable. Article IV, Section 7 of the California Constitution says that “the proceedings of each house and the committees thereof shall be open and public,” written as part of Proposition 54’s mandate that bills be available for public review for 72 hours before a final vote. The concern is that lawmakers voting remotely won’t meet the standard for public access to their actions.

Assemblyman Kevin Mullin (D-San Mateo), who serves as speaker pro tem, says he’s working on a constitutional amendment to help clarify the rules in hopes that it provides governing options in times like these and during natural disasters. The change would have to be approved by voters this November.

How much the Legislature can accomplish this year is limited by the calendar. Almost all of the Assembly’s policy committees will meet only one more time this year to consider bills authored by its members. Only 14 bills were on the agenda for Monday’s meeting of the Assembly Transportation Committee, even though legislative records show 84 bills were sent to the committee — meaning most of them will be held without further action.

The transportation panel offered one of the more unusual moments on Monday, its 15 members and assorted staff convening in the cavernous Assembly chamber, where they could safely spread out.

Two legislators wore gloves. One of them, Assemblyman Mike Gipson (D-Carson), sported a black protective mask with the phrase “California Safe” written in white letters.

“What a historic moment,” said Assemblywoman Luz Rivas (D-North Hollywood) as she stood behind a stanchion to present her bill, Assembly Bill 3213, which seeks to force new project priorities for the California High-Speed Rail Authority.

Yet when the city issued an emergency proclamation Friday that required citizens to wear face coverings, store employees were “threatened with physical violence and showered with verbal abuse,” according to a statement released by the city. In response, Stillwater quickly amended its wording to only “encourage” use of masks.

“This has occurred in three short hours and in the face of clear medical evidence that face coverings help contain the spread of COVID-19,” Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said in a statement. “Many of those with objections cite the mistaken belief the requirement is unconstitutional, and under their theory, one cannot be forced to wear a mask. No law or court supports this view.”

About a dozen states have reopened more of their economies since Friday’s calendar turn to May, with several, including Florida, loosening more restrictions Monday. No matter where a state falls on the reopening spectrum, though, all Americans who choose to go outside are being met with a choice that isn’t going away anytime soon: to cover up or not?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says “everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public” to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. The federal agency notes that masks are to protect others and that they are not a substitute for social distancing.

In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine backtracked last week on an order to require masks be worn in stores as too many Ohioans found it “offensive.”

“It became clear to me that was just a bridge too far. People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do,” DeWine said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

On Monday, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, as part of a tour acknowledging the reopening of most of the state, visited a thrift store in Joplin that is operated by the Disabled American Veterans. The veteran workers wore masks, but Parson did not.

“I chose not to,” Parson said, when asked at his news briefing why he did not cover his face.

“I think it’s up to the individuals. I don’t think that’s government’s role to mandate who wears a mask and who don’t. I go back to what I’ve said all along: It’s your personal responsibility.”

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis allowed the reopening of most restaurants, retailers, museums and libraries at 25% capacity Monday. DeSantis — who controversially referred to his state, with its large population of older residents, as “God’s waiting room” last week — is recommending that employees and customers wear masks, but he is not requiring it.

DeSantis’ phased opening plan kept populous South Florida counties Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach closed for most business.

Miami reopened parks to the public last week, but only with the mandatory use of masks. By the end of the weekend, park rangers had handed out more than 7,000 warnings to people not wearing face covers, most of them in the popular South Pointe Park, police said. On Monday, the city closed up the park at the end of South Beach yet again.

New Jersey opened its parks Saturday, and although Gov. Phil Murphy was pleased overall with the social distancing compliance shown by the population, he shared one major complaint Monday.

“Not enough masks,” he said. Eighty percent to 90% “of the folks were not wearing masks.”

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a mandatory mask order April 15 and said Monday that he believes local governments should have the right to enforce it.

“Because you could literally kill someone,” Cuomo said. “How cruel and irresponsible would that be? … It’s not that big of a deal. You don’t wear a mask to protect yourself. You wear a mask to protect me. And I wear a mask to protect you.

“No one said wear a mask all the time. If you go for a walk in the woods, you don’t have to wear a mask. You can have the mask down when walking in the woods, but if you see someone coming the other way, you put the mask on. It’s the least we can do.”

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 68,600 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than a third of American losses from the disease were in the state of New York, which has become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more than 24,900 deaths as of Monday afternoon. The global death total has surpassed 250,000.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio began his Monday morning news briefing by talking about how nice the weather had been in the city over the weekend — and how that could lead to a false sense of normality. New York City on Monday reported 13,536 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 and 5,373 deaths in which the cause was listed as the disease but the victim was not tested.

De Blasio said he did not have a problem with citizens returning to outside spaces and enjoying the weather as long as they wore a mask and kept social distancing requirements. He announced Monday that the city would be distributing 5 million three-ply nonmedical masks and 2.5 million cloth face coverings for free in the coming weeks.

“Wherever you turn, you’re going to be offered a face covering,” De Blasio said.

De Blasio and New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea were peppered with questions stemming from a video of an officer pointing a Taser at bystanders in lower Manhattan during an arrest of people accused of not social distancing properly. The video shows the officer punching and slapping a man as he brings him to the ground.

“This one incident is troubling, but there’s been tens of thousands of interactions between police officer and civilians that went very well,” De Blasio said. The officer has been placed on modified duty and the incident is being investigated, De Blasio said Sunday.

On Monday he said more face covers could help prevent future violent scenarios from playing out with enforcement, but in this case, the plainclothes officer was also not wearing a mask.

In Oklahoma, Stillwater City Manager McNickle said in a statement that one of the incidents involving the mask requirement included a threat with a firearm.

In Michigan, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered that masks be worn through May, state police investigators are looking into reports that a Flint dollar store security guard was fatally shot Friday after an argument with a customer who had refused to wear a mask in the store, according to the Detroit News.

The man who died leaves behind a wife and eight kids.

“My condolences go out to the family of the security guard,” Whitmer said Monday. “It is incredible that people continue to show up to work to protect everyone else. We are mindful of how important it is that people keep a level head, that we do the right things. I ask that all Michiganders keep their wits about them and take actions to protect themselves and others in this incredibly stressful time.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-04/coronavirus-masks-states-reopeningauthor
"['Charles Duhigg', 'Charles Duhig', 'Isaac Chotine', 'Jeannie Suk Gerse']",2020-05-04,Seattle’s Leaders Let Scientists Take the Lead. New York’s Did Not,"The first diagnosis of the coronavirus in the United States occurred in mid-January, in a Seattle suburb not far from the hospital where Dr. Francis Riedo, an infectious-disease specialist, works. When he heard the patient’s details—a thirty-five-year-old man had walked into an urgent-care clinic with a cough and a slight fever, and told doctors that he’d just returned from Wuhan, China—Riedo said to himself, “It’s begun.”

For more than a week, Riedo had been e-mailing with a group of colleagues who included Seattle’s top doctor for public health and Washington State’s senior health officer, as well as hundreds of epidemiologists from around the country; many of them, like Riedo, had trained at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta, in a program known as the Epidemic Intelligence Service. Alumni of the E.I.S. are considered America’s shock troops in combatting disease outbreaks. The program has more than three thousand graduates, and many now work in state and local governments across the country. “It’s kind of like a secret society, but for saving people,” Riedo told me. “If you have a question, or need to understand the local politics somewhere, or need a hand during an outbreak—if you reach out to the E.I.S. network, they’ll drop everything to help.”

Riedo is the medical director for infectious disease at EvergreenHealth, a hospital in Kirkland, just east of Seattle. Upon learning of the first domestic diagnosis, he told his staff—from emergency-room nurses to receptionists—that, from then on, everything they said was just as important as what they did. One of the E.I.S.’s core principles is that a pandemic is a communications emergency as much as a medical crisis. Members of the public entering the hospital, Riedo told his staff, must be asked if they had travelled out of the country; if someone had respiratory trouble, staff needed to collect as much information as possible about the patient’s recent interactions with other people, including where they had taken place. You never know, Riedo explained, which chance encounter will shape a catastrophe. There are so many terrifying possibilities in a pandemic; information brings relief.

A national shortage of diagnostic kits for the new coronavirus meant that only people who had recently visited China were eligible for testing. Even as EvergreenHealth’s beds began filling with cases of flulike symptoms—including a patient from Life Care, a nursing home two miles away—the hospital’s doctors were unable to test them for the new disease, because none of the sufferers had been to China or been in contact with anyone who had. For nearly a month, as the hospital’s patients complained of aches, fevers, and breathing problems—and exhibited symptoms associated with COVID-19, such as “glassy” patches in X-rays of their lungs—none of them were evaluated for the disease. Riedo wanted to start warning people that evidence of an outbreak was growing, but he had only suspicions, not facts.

At the end of February, the C.D.C. began allowing the testing of patients with unexplained respiratory-tract infections or “fever and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness.” Riedo called a friend—an E.I.S. alum at the local department of health. If he sent her swabs from two patients who had needed ventilators but had tested negative for influenza and other common respiratory diseases, would she test them for COVID-19? At that point, there had been only sixteen detections of the coronavirus in the U.S., and only the one in Washington State. “I can’t remember why we picked those two patients,” Riedo told me. “I was sure they’d be negative. But we thought it would be good to start collecting data, and it was a way to make sure the testing lab was working.” The health official told him to send the samples to her lab.

Riedo remembered that other local researchers had been conducting a project called the Seattle Flu Study. For months, they had collected nasal swabs from volunteers, to better understand how influenza spread through the community. During the previous few weeks, the researchers, in quiet violation of C.D.C. guidance, had jury-rigged a coronavirus test in their lab and had started using it on their samples. They had just found a positive hit: a high-school student in a suburb twenty-eight miles from Seattle, with no recent history of foreign travel and no known interactions with anyone from China. The boy wasn’t seriously ill; if the researchers hadn’t done the test, the infection probably never would have been detected. The genetic sequence of the boy’s virus was unnervingly similar to that of the man with the first known case, even though the researchers couldn’t find any connections between them. The frightening implication was that the coronavirus was already so widespread that contagion was passing invisibly among community members.

At seven-forty that evening, Riedo got a call from his friend at the public-health lab. Both of the samples he had sent were positive. Riedo sent over swabs from nine other EvergreenHealth patients. Eight were positive. Riedo grabbed the patients’ charts and saw that seven of them had come from the Life Care nursing home. It didn’t make any sense: nursing-home residents don’t travel, and interact mainly with just family members and staff.

Riedo sent in more samples. Most of the patients tested positive, including a woman who had been told that she had pneumonia, another woman who had complained of sweating and clammy hands, and a man in his fifties with serious respiratory problems. For three days, dozens of that man’s family members had sat at his bedside in the hospital, coming in and out of the building and going from home to work, visiting restaurants and shaking people’s hands, inadvertently exposing themselves and others to COVID-19.

At that moment, there were no known U.S. coronavirus fatalities. Schools, restaurants, and workplaces were open. Stock markets were near all-time highs. But when Riedo stopped to calculate how many of his hospital employees had been exposed to the coronavirus he had to quit when his list surpassed two hundred people. “If we sent all of those workers home for two weeks, which is what the C.D.C. was recommending, we’d have to shut down the entire hospital,” he told me. He felt like a man who, having casually swatted at a buzzing insect, suddenly realized that he was beneath a beehive.

The next day, the man with all the family visitors died. It was America’s first known COVID-19 death. Riedo called his wife. “I told her I didn’t know when I would be coming home,” he said to me. “And then I started e-mailing everyone I knew to say we were past containment. It had already escaped.”

Epidemiology is a science of possibilities and persuasion, not of certainties or hard proof. “Being approximately right most of the time is better than being precisely right occasionally,” the Scottish epidemiologist John Cowden wrote, in 2010. “You can only be sure when to act in retrospect.” Epidemiologists must persuade people to upend their lives—to forgo travel and socializing, to submit themselves to blood draws and immunization shots—even when there’s scant evidence that they’re directly at risk.

Epidemiologists also must learn how to maintain their persuasiveness even as their advice shifts. The recommendations that public-health professionals make at the beginning of an emergency—there’s no need to wear masks; children can’t become seriously ill—often change as hypotheses are disproved, new experiments occur, and a virus mutates. The C.D.C.’s Field Epidemiology Manual, which devotes an entire chapter to communication during a health emergency, indicates that there should be a lead spokesperson whom the public gets to know—familiarity breeds trust. The spokesperson should have a “Single Overriding Health Communication Objective, or SOHCO (pronounced sock-O),” which should be repeated at the beginning and the end of any communication with the public. After the opening SOHCO, the spokesperson should “acknowledge concerns and express understanding of how those affected by the illnesses or injuries are probably feeling.” Such a gesture of empathy establishes common ground with scared and dubious citizens—who, because of their mistrust, can be at the highest risk for transmission. The spokesperson should make special efforts to explain both what is known and what is unknown. Transparency is essential, the field manual says, and officials must “not over-reassure or overpromise.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/seattles-leaders-let-scientists-take-the-lead-new-yorks-did-not
"['David Remnick', 'David Remnic', 'Isaac Chotine']",2020-04-20,The Preëxisting Condition in the Oval Office,"Illustration by João Fazenda

When has New York known a grimmer week? The sirens are unceasing. Funeral parlors are overwhelmed. Refrigerator trailers are now in service as morgues, and can be found parked outside hospitals all over town. We’re told that there are “glimmers of hope,” that hospital admissions are slowing, that the curve is flattening. Yet the misery is far from over. “The bad news isn’t just bad,” New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said at one of his briefings last week. “The bad news is actually terrible.”

Across the country, the coronavirus continues to ravage the confined and the vulnerable, from inmates of the Cook County jail, in Chicago, to workers at the Tyson Foods poultry plant in Camilla, Georgia. Data from a variety of reliable sources show that African-Americans, who suffer disproportionately from poverty, inadequate housing, limited access to good health care, and chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension, are dying from COVID-19 at horrific rates.

The pandemic is an event in the natural history of our species, but it is also a political episode. Its trajectory is shaped by policy measures specific to particular governments. The fact that the United States is experiencing tremendous losses—that it has far more COVID-19 cases than any other country in the world—relates to a number of collective risk factors and preëxisting conditions. The most notable one is to be found in the Oval Office.

“This is not the apocalypse,” President Barack Obama assured his shell-shocked staff members the morning after Donald Trump’s election. When, the next day, Obama received Trump at the White House and tried to relay information about a range of issues—the threat from North Korea, the Iran nuclear deal, immigration, health care—he got nowhere. Trump wanted to talk about himself and the size of his campaign rallies. Obama spoke about the value of having at his side such people as his homeland-security adviser, Lisa Monaco, citing her insistence on bringing him unvarnished, unwelcome news about everything from terrorism to the Ebola crisis. In the White House, she was known as Dr. Doom. Trump replied that maybe he should hire a Dr. Doom; he was joking. From the beginning, he practiced social distancing from anyone who told him what he didn’t want to hear.

And here we are, playing a tragic game of catch-up against a virus that has killed thousands and left millions unemployed. At Trump’s State of the Union address on February 4th, he pledged, “My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.” Three weeks later, Kayleigh McEnany, a loud promoter of birtherism and of Trump talking points during the 2016 campaign, cheerfully told the Fox Business audience, “We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here, we will not see terrorism come here, and isn’t that refreshing when contrasting it with the awful Presidency of President Obama?” Now McEnany is the President’s press secretary.

The coronavirus has inflicted a level of pain that is deep and global. And yet many nations, from South Korea to Germany, have done far better at responding to it than the United States has. The reasons for the American failing include a lack of preparation, delayed mobilization, insufficient testing, and a reluctance to halt travel. The Administration, from its start, has waged war on science and expertise and on what Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon called “the administrative state.” The results are all around us. Trump has made sure that a great nation is peculiarly vulnerable to a foreseeable public-health calamity.

If the death rate turns out to be less than the initial forecasts––and, please, let it be so––it will be thanks to the discipline of the public and the heroics of first responders, not the foresight or the leadership of the President. The knowledge that we are led so ineptly and with such brazen self-regard is humiliating to millions of American citizens, if not to their leader. Trump gives himself “a ten” for his performance and berates any reporter who dares to challenge that premise. “You should say, ‘Congratulations! Great job!’ ” he told one, “instead of being so horrid in the way you ask the question!”

A nation facing a common threat normally pulls together, but Trump’s reflex is always to divide; he has invoked a multiplying litany of enemies. He directs his fire at the Obama Administration, at the World Health Organization, and at governors from Albany to Sacramento, with their constant pleas for ventilators, test kits, and face masks. The Democrats are to blame for everything. Early in the year, as the pandemic grew, they “diverted” the attention of the federal government, because “every day was all about impeachment,” as Trump’s unfailing loyalist Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, put it.

At a time of medical peril and economic devastation, the President heads to the White House briefing room and frames the terms of his reëlection campaign. It is a campaign of cynicism and authoritarian impulses. To begin with, he has made it clear that he does not approve of efforts to make voting easier in November. Why should he? He takes a dim view of early voting, voting by mail, and same-day registration. Such reforms, he complains, would produce “levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”

Trump has not had the sort of bounce in the polls usually seen by Presidents during a crisis, but this hardly insures an end to his reign. Senator Bernie Sanders, who did so much to transform the debate over health care, the environment, and education policy, in both the 2016 and 2020 campaigns, has dropped out of the race, and the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, has been either absent or woefully inarticulate in recent weeks. The former Vice-President cannot run on the idea of personal decency alone. He needs to provide a vivid, comprehensive plan of renewal equal to the moment. He needs to emphasize hard truths, one being that the laws of science, of the physical world, must be recognized. This pandemic is, in a sense, a rehearsal for what awaits us if we continue to ignore the demands of climate change. Biden would signal a seriousness of intent and offer a convincing alternative if he were to name very soon not only a Vice-Presidential running mate but a set of advisers and Cabinet officers who have shown themselves capable of policy rigor, executive competence, and compassion for the very communities that are suffering most from neglect and mistreatment.

Meanwhile, at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, a painful reckoning begins. New York has long prided itself on being a sort of cultural and political city-state, able to hold its own against any vagaries emanating from the White House. This is plainly not the case. We are in this together: that is the phrase, the balm, of the moment. But it is more than a cliché. It should be the spirit and the foundation of our national politics, starting with the election in November. ♦

"['Carolyn Kormann', 'Carolyn Korman', 'Eliza Griswol', 'Isaac Chotine', 'Siddhartha Mukherje']",2020-03-27,"From Bats to Human Lungs, the Evolution of a Coronavirus","For thousands of years, a parasite with no name lived happily among horseshoe bats in southern China. The bats had evolved to the point that they did not notice; they went about their nightly flights unbothered. One day, the parasite—an ancestor of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2—had an opportunity to expand its realm. Perhaps it was a pangolin, the scaly anteater, an endangered species that is a victim of incessant wildlife trafficking and sold, often secretly, in live-animal markets throughout Southeast Asia and China. Or not. The genetic pathway remains unclear. But to survive in a new species, whatever it was, the virus had to mutate dramatically. It might even have taken a segment of a different coronavirus strain that already inhabited its new host, and morphed into a hybrid—a better, stronger version of itself, a pathogenic Everyman capable of thriving in diverse species. More recently, the coronavirus found a new species: ours. Perhaps a weary traveller rubbed his eyes, or scratched his nose, or was anxiously, unconsciously, biting his fingernails. One tiny, invisible blob of virus. One human face. And here we are, battling a global pandemic.

The world’s confirmed cases (those with a positive lab test for COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) doubled in seven days, from nearly two hundred and thirteen thousand, on March 19th, to four hundred and sixty-seven thousand, on March 26th. Nearly twenty-one thousand people have died. The United States now has more confirmed cases than any country on earth, with more than eighty thousand on March 26th. These numbers are a fraction of the real, unknown total in this country and around the world, and the numbers will keep going up. Scientists behind a new study, published earlier this month in the journal Science, have found that for every confirmed case there are likely five to ten more people in the community with an undetected infection. This will likely remain the case. “The testing is not near adequate,” one of the study’s authors, Jeffrey Shaman, an environmental-health sciences professor at Columbia University, said. Comments from emergency-room doctors have been circulating on social media like S.O.S. flares. One, from Daniele Macchini, a doctor in Bergamo, north of Milan, described the situation as a “tsunami that has overwhelmed us.”

Scientists first discovered that coronaviruses originate among bats following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Jonathan Epstein, an epidemiologist at the EcoHealth Alliance in New York who studies zoonotic viruses—those that can jump from animals to people—was part of a research team that went hunting for the source in China’s Guangdong Province, where simultaneous SARS outbreaks had occurred, suggesting multiple spillovers from animals to people. At first, health officials believed palm civets, a mongoose-like species commonly eaten in parts of China, were responsible, as they were widely sold at markets connected to the SARS outbreak, and tested positive for the virus. But civets bred elsewhere in Guangdong had no antibodies for the virus, indicating that the market animals were only an intermediary, highly infectious host. Epstein and others suspected that bats, which are ubiquitous in the area’s rural, agricultural hills, and were, at the time, also sold from cages at Guangdong’s wet markets, might be the coronavirus’s natural reservoir.

The researchers travelled through the countryside, setting up field labs inside limestone caverns and taking swabs from dozens of bats through the night. After months of investigation, Epstein’s team discovered four species of horseshoe bats that carried coronaviruses similar to SARS, one of which carried a coronavirus that was, genetically, a more than ninety per cent match. “They were found in all of the locations where SARS clusters were happening,” he said.

After years of further bat surveillance, researchers eventually found the direct coronavirus antecedent to SARS, as well as hundreds of other coronaviruses circulating among some of the fourteen hundred bats species that live on six continents. Coronaviruses, and other virus families, it turns out, have been co-evolving with bats for the entire span of human civilization, and possibly much longer. As the coronavirus family grows, different strains simultaneously co-infect individual bats, turning their little bodies into virus blenders, creating new strains of every sort, some more powerful than others. This process happens without making bats sick—a phenomenon that scientists have linked to bats’ singular ability, among mammals, to fly. The feat takes a severe toll, such that their immune systems have evolved a better way to repair cell damage and to fight off viruses without provoking further inflammation. But when these viruses leap into a new species—whether a pangolin or a civet or a human—the result can be severe, sometimes deadly, sickness.

In 2013, Epstein’s main collaborator in China, Shi Zheng-Li, sequenced a coronavirus found in bats, which, in January, she discovered shares ninety-six per cent of its genome with SARS-CoV-2. The two viruses have a common ancestor that dates back thirty to fifty years, but the absence of a perfect match suggests that further mutation took place in other bat colonies, and then in an intermediate host. When forty-one severe cases of pneumonia were first announced in Wuhan, in December, many of them were connected to a wet market with a notorious wildlife section. Animals are stacked in cages—rabbits on top of civets on top of ferret-badgers. “That’s just a gravitational exchange of fecal matter and viruses,” Epstein said. Chinese authorities reported that they tested animals at the market—all of which came back negative—but they have not specified which animals they tested, information that is crucial for Epstein’s detective work. Authorities later found the virus in samples taken from the market’s tables and gutters. But, because not all of the first patients were tied to the market, nor were they connected to one another, Epstein said, “it raised the question of, well, perhaps those forty-one weren’t the first cases.”

Analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicate a single spillover event, meaning the virus jumped only once from an animal to a person, which makes it likely that the virus was circulating among people before December. Unless more information about the animals at the Wuhan market is released, the transmission chain may never be clear. There are, however, numerous possibilities. A bat hunter or a wildlife trafficker might have brought the virus to the market. Pangolins happen to carry a coronavirus, which they might have picked up from bats years ago, and which is, in one crucial part of its genome, virtually identical to SARS-CoV-2. But no one has yet found evidence that pangolins were at the Wuhan market, or even that venders there trafficked pangolins. “We’ve created circumstances in our world somehow that allows for these viruses, which would otherwise not be known to cause any problems, to get into human populations,” Mark Denison, the director of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Institute for Infection, Immunology, and Inflammation, told me. “And this one happened to say, ‘I really like it here.’ ”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/from-bats-to-human-lungs-the-evolution-of-a-coronavirus
"['Bill Mckibben', 'Bill Mckibbe']",2020-04-16,How We Can Build a Hardier World After the Coronavirus,"The coronavirus pandemic has revealed one particularly shocking thing about our societies and economies: they have been operating on a very thin margin. The edifice seems so shiny and substantial, a world of silver jets stitching together cities of towering skyscrapers, a globe of soaring markets and smartphone connectivity. But a couple of months into this disease and it’s all tottering, the jets grounded and the cities silent and the markets reeling. One industry after another is heading for bankruptcy, and no one knows if they will come back. In other words, however shiny it may have seemed, it wasn’t very sturdy. Some people—the President, for instance—think that we can just put it all back like it was before, with a “big bang,” once the “invisible enemy” is gone. But any prosperity built on what was evidently a shaky foundation is going to seem Potemkinish going forward; we don’t want always to feel as if we’re just weeks away from some kind of chaos.

So if we’re thinking about building civilization back in a hardier and more resilient form, we’ll have to learn what a more stable footing might look like. I think that we can take an important lesson from the doctors dealing with the coronavirus, and that’s related to comorbidity, or underlying conditions. It turns out, not surprisingly, that if you’ve got diabetes or hypertension, or have a suppressed immune system, you’re far more likely to be felled by COVID-19.

Societies, too, come with underlying conditions, and the two that haunt our planet right now are inequality and ecological turmoil. They’ve both spiked in the past few decades, with baleful results that normally stay just below the surface, felt but not fully recognized. But as soon as something else goes wrong—a new microbe launches a pandemic, say—they become starkly evident. Inequality, in this instance, means that people have to keep working, even if they’re not well, because they lack health insurance and live day to day, paycheck to paycheck, and hence they can spread disease. Ecological instability, especially the ever-climbing mercury, means that even as governors try to cope with the pandemic they must worry, too, about the prospect of another spring with massive flooding across the Midwest, or how they’ll cope if wildfire season gets out of control. Last month, the U.S. Forest Service announced that, owing to the pandemic, it is suspending controlled burns, for instance, “one of the most effective tools for increasing California’s resiliency to fire.” God forbid that we get another big crisis or two while this one is still preoccupying us—but simple math means that it’s almost inevitable.

And, of course, all these things interact with one another: inequality means that some people must live near sources of air pollution that most of us wouldn’t tolerate, which in turn means that their lungs are weakened, which in turn means they can’t fight off the coronavirus. (It also means that some of the same people can lack access to good food, and are more likely to be diabetic.) And, if there’s a massive wildfire, smoke fills the air for weeks, weakening everybody’s lungs, but especially those at the bottom of the ladder. When there’s a hurricane and people need to flee, the stress and the trauma can compromise immune systems. Simply living at the sharp end of an unequal and racist society can do the same thing. And so on, in an unyielding spiral of increasing danger.

Since we must rebuild our economies, we need to try to engineer out as much ecological havoc and inequality as we can—as much danger as we can. That won’t be easy, but there are clear and obvious steps that would help—there are ways to structure the increased use of renewable energy that will confront inequality at the same time. Much will be written about such plans in the months to come, but at the level of deepest principle here’s what’s key, I think: from a society that has prized growth above all and been willing to play fast and loose with justice and ecology, we need to start emphasizing sturdiness, hardiness, resiliency. (And a big part of that is fairness.) The resulting world won’t be quite as shiny, but, somehow, shininess seems less important now.

Passing the Mic

Mary Annaïse Heglar is one of the freshest and most important voices in the climate movement. She’s the writer-in-residence at Columbia University’s Earth Institute in partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Her personal essays—most of which revolve around themes of climate justice—are some of the most engaging writing I know on a subject that often inspires earnestness; a recent favorite was in Wired magazine. This interview has been condensed for clarity.

You say, “The facts have been on our side for a very long time, but we’re still losing.” Why?

The science on climate change has been crystal clear for literally decades. As Amy Westervelt has illustrated beautifully, on her podcast “Drilled,” the fossil-fuel companies knew that before anyone else. James Hansen testified before Congress thirty-two years ago. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the precursor to the Paris Agreement) dates back to 1992. We didn’t wind up in a climate crisis for lack of information, or even for lack of clearly communicated information. What was done was not done out of ignorance—it was done out of malice and greed. If all we had to do was have the right facts, we’d have been done a long time ago.

People feel as if they can’t take part in the fight because they’re not scientifically inclined. What do you tell them?

What I tell them is, “Girl, me, neither!” But you don’t need a scientific background or inclination to be part of the climate movement or conversation. This is not about science; it’s about justice. The science proves the severity of the injustice, sure, but it’s not the entire story. There’s a place for everyone in the climate movement because everyone, even the smallest toddler, understands the concept of “no fair.”

Everyone always asks me, “What should I be doing as an individual?” But is that even the right way to frame the question?

I get that question all the time, too, and it’s really frustrating. As I argue in my article, if you’re ready to graduate beyond the things that everyone should be doing—like cutting your carbon footprint, and voting for the climate, and showing up to demonstrations—then you’ve reached the point where you’re ready to become a bona-fide climate person. That means you’re past the one-size-fits-all activism. It’s time for your activism to mold to you, and only you can do that. No one told Greta [Thunberg] to strike, no one told Jamie and Nadia [the teen-age climate activists Jamie Margolin and Nadia Nazar] to help start Zero Hour. They just did it. No one told me to write—in fact, plenty of people told me not to! There’s so much to be done on climate, and so much that the people already involved with it haven’t thought of. There’s so much room for new ideas and new voices, so if you’re a new or aspiring climate person, you’re right on time. The better question would be “What can I do next?” An even better question would be “How did you find your niche in climate?” And then take those answers and carve out your own niche.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/how-we-can-build-a-hardier-world-after-the-coronavirus
"['Susan B. Glasser', 'Susan B. Glasse']",2020-05-01,History According to Trump: The President and the 1917 Pandemic That Wasn’t,"As the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted his Presidency, Donald Trump has often complained about the terrible hand that history has dealt him. This “deadly scourge” that crept up on him and disrupted a golden age of prosperity for America is “something the world has not seen for a long, long time,” as Trump put it on Monday, in one of his by now familiar riffs. “You could probably go back to 1917, where it was a terrible period of time,” he added. “You all know what happened in 1917.” On Tuesday, he returned once again to the theme of his once-in-a-century bad luck. “Even if you go back into 1917,” Trump said at a White House event for small-business leaders, “that was the worst of all time, but it was also not as bad as here. It was very bad, it was very rough. It was a bad one, but it wasn’t quite like what we’re going through right now.”

Except, of course, that the very bad, very rough, worst-of-all-time influenza outbreak was not a pandemic in 1917. The flu that killed more than six hundred and fifty thousand Americans was detected in the U.S. in the spring of 1918 and had killed an estimated fifty million people worldwide by 1920. Trump’s mistake is one of those small, seemingly inconsequential errors that anyone, and especially our fact-challenged President, might make. But Trump, it turns out, has referred to a 1917 flu dozens of times since mid-March, almost always when complaining about his own misfortune in leading the country through such a historically rare event. “Nobody has trained for this, nobody has seen this, I would say, since 1917, which was the greatest of them all, the greatest of this type of battle. Probably the greatest of them all, right? 1917,” Trump said, on April 4th. This week’s comments were no slip of the tongue.

When I checked Factbase, a Web site that catalogues Trump’s public statements, I found that he had made at least twenty-seven references to a 1917 flu pandemic since March 11th, and that did not count the offhand reference he made late Thursday afternoon while once again talking with reporters. A search of the White House Web site found that Trump mentioned 1917 on twenty-three days since mid-March. In a handful of instances—six, by my count—Trump referred to both 1917 and 1918, suggesting that someone had perhaps tried to give him the correct date, but he could never quite get it to stick. The story of a 1917 flu pandemic may well go down as a Trump classic, a pointless and unnecessary screwup that is also very telling about the President.

There’s another reason Trump’s repeated references to a nonexistent epidemic of 1917 seem so discordant: Trump’s own grandfather died of the flu, in 1918, likely from the first wave of the outbreak. Returning home from a walk in New York City one day that May, Friedrich Trump told his son that he felt ill, according to the historian Gwenda Blair. Soon after, he was dead. His grandson grew up to be the President of the United States during a time of global pandemic. He does not publicly mention how his grandfather died. “Another politician might well seize on his grandfather’s death during the 1918-19 pandemic as a point of empathy with those who have lost family and friends to COVID-19, but empathy is not in Trump’s playbook,” Blair, who interviewed Trump’s father about Friedrich Trump’s death but could not get the future President to speak about it for her 2000 history of the family, told me. “In the pandemic, as in everything else, his M.O. is about victory, vanquishing and demolishing perceived enemies and threats, from immigrants to the media to the coronavirus, not about identifying with loss and grief.”

Donald Trump, of course, is famously historically illiterate, a Republican President who has marvelled publicly that Abraham Lincoln, the Party’s patron saint, was a member of the G.O.P. At a Black History Month event, he spoke of Frederick Douglass, the nineteenth-century abolitionist leader, as if he were still alive and “being recognized more and more.” In “A Very Stable Genius,” the recent book about Trump by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of the Washington Post, there is an anecdote about the President visiting the U.S.S. Arizona memorial, in Hawaii, with John Kelly, his then chief of staff. Trump appeared to know almost nothing about the sneak attack that prompted the U.S. entrance into the Second World War. “Hey, John, what’s this all about?” the book quoted Trump as saying. “What’s this a tour of?”

The President’s ignorance about history, however, is often at odds with his desire to portray himself as a world-historical figure of vast importance. Just months into his Administration, he called his Presidency the most successful and accomplished of any since America’s founding. “There’s never been a President who’s passed more legislation,” Trump said five months after taking office, exempting only F.D.R. amid the Depression, “who’s done more things than what we’ve done.” At the time, Trump had passed and signed thirty-nine laws, all of them relatively minor.

The coronavirus pandemic has only accentuated Trump’s tendency to portray himself as a figure of sweeping historical significance, no matter how distorted that history is. “We built the greatest economy in the history of the world,” Trump said the other day, “and nobody even disputes that,” though it is not only disputed but quite obviously untrue. Trump is well aware that his entire Presidency now rides on the outcome of the pandemic and how he is perceived to have handled it. Already, Trump and his advisers are beginning to rewrite the history of the virus in a way that ignores the delay and denialism that led the U.S. to suffer the worst outbreak in the world so far.

On Wednesday morning, there was a “Fox & Friends” appearance for the ages by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has played a key behind-the-scenes role in the White House’s coronavirus response. “We’re on the other side of the medical aspect of this,” Kushner said, an astounding statement considering that, within the previous twenty-four hours, the United States had just hit more than a million confirmed infections and, in a space of weeks, surpassed the American death toll for the entire Vietnam War. “The federal government rose to the challenge, and this is a great success story,” Kushner added. Trump also took that view in an appearance later on Wednesday, saying, “We did the right thing. We did an incredible job.” This weekend, according to Politico, the Trump campaign intends to begin a seven-figure national television-ad blitz “touting Trump’s performance managing the coronavirus crisis.” The ads “will depict Trump as showing leadership in the face of opposition from Democrats and the media,” Politico reported.

Revising history to suit their political interests is something that all politicians do. Trump and company, however, are brazenly attempting to do so even as the body count continues to rise and the economy is still sinking. Thirty days ago, at the start of April, there were around a million cases reported worldwide and about fifty thousand deaths globally. Today, there are more than a million cases and more than sixty thousand deaths in the United States alone. More people have died of the coronavirus in our nation’s capital than in the entire country of Greece. As for the economy, new unemployment figures released on Thursday revealed that more than thirty million Americans have filed for jobless benefits since the crisis began, and economists predict a thirty-per-cent drop in G.D.P. in the second quarter of this year—the sort of plunge not seen since the Great Depression. How is this a “great success”?",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/trump-and-the-1917-pandemic-that-wasnt
"['Sam Knight', 'Sam Knigh', 'Colin Marshal']",2020-05-05,The Comforting and Misleading Political Response to Britain’s Coronavirus Disaster,"On Sunday, the toll from Britain’s outbreak of COVID-19 surpassed twenty-eight thousand deaths. You don’t need a graph, or to argue about the methodological niceties of how governments count their dead, to understand that the United Kingdom has had a terrible encounter with the virus. Britain has an internationally respected public-health apparatus. In October, 2016, the government ran Exercise Cygnus, a simulation of how a global influenza pandemic would overwhelm the nation’s health system and ravage the economy. Last year, Britain’s National Security Risk Assessment highlighted the risk of a mutated-flu outbreak as one of the worst—and most likely—risks facing the country, as well as the possibility of “an emerging respiratory coronavirus infection” arriving in the U.K. The Department of Health continues to describe Britain as “one of the most prepared countries in the world for pandemics.” And yet. In the weeks after December 30th, last year, when Chinese officials first informed the World Health Organization of a novel coronavirus in Wuhan, the U.K. made no striking plans to respond. Even as the virus tore through Northern Italy, and the British authorities had a chance to see, at relatively close quarters, what COVID-19 could do to a prosperous European society, they dithered. Countries such as Germany, South Korea, and Singapore, which have responded well to the virus, all appear to have followed a similar playbook of mass testing, contact tracing, and collective vigilance. Each nation that has failed is more likely to have its own particular story of what went wrong. We are unhappy in our own way.

In Britain, the most obvious misstep by Boris Johnson’s government was its hesitation to implement a national lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. During February and the early part of March, Johnson and his Cabinet embraced and then abandoned the concept of herd immunity. On March 13th, Graham Medley, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who is the government’s chief modeller of the pandemic, told the BBC that in an ideal world there would be “a nice big epidemic” among the healthy part of the population. “What we are going to have to try and do, ideally, is . . . manage this acquisition of herd immunity and minimize the exposure of people who are vulnerable,” he said. Ministers quickly denied that this was the strategy, because it entailed the risk of two hundred and fifty thousand deaths, but Johnson did not switch to stringent quarantine measures until March 23rd. There was a directionless, ten-day period in which the virus was able to circulate more or less freely. Soccer matches and horse-racing festivals went ahead. Johnson joked about shaking people’s hands. Thousands of people became infected and later died. The reasons behind this drift are complex and contested. Since the start of the crisis, Britain’s politicians have sworn that they were following “the science,” even when it was clear that they were latching onto concepts, such as herd immunity and behavioral fatigue (in which people would supposedly tire of social-distancing measures), because they liked the sound of them. At the same time, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, a revolving panel of some twenty experts, and its various specialist subcommittees, also appears to have given advice that was politically viable rather than aimed solely at saving lives.

But Britain’s slow lockdown offers only a partial explanation for what has followed. Germany shut down one day earlier but has had around a quarter of the deaths from COVID-19, among a larger and older population. On March 12th, the U.K. gave up on testing for the coronavirus outside hospitals. By April 1st, of the National Health Service’s half a million front-line health-care workers, only two thousand had been tested. (More than a hundred have now died.) In late March, Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, told reporters that large-scale testing and tracing—as was being practiced successfully in South Korea and Singapore—was not suitable for the U.K. “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention,” she said.

There has been a curious mixture of superiority and fatalism about Britain’s entire response to COVID-19. Officials have maintained that the country has “a perfectly adequate supply” of personal protective equipment, but this has never been the case. Last week, the Royal College of Physicians reported that about a third of doctors performing “aerosol-generating procedures” did not always have access to either visors or surgical gowns. On May 3rd, a survey of sixteen thousand doctors found that forty-eight per cent had bought or obtained pieces of P.P.E. outside official channels. Among the wider population, polls show that around eighty per cent of people believe that the lockdown should continue. This is sometimes taken as approval of the government’s handling of the crisis. But it is unclear how much support for the lockdown derives from fear. During March, the number of patients coming to emergency rooms across England fell by twenty-nine per cent. The number of people who were treated for suspected heart attacks fell by half.

As in other countries, the death toll from COVID-19 has been mapped onto existing inequalities. Residents of the most deprived communities in England and Wales have died from the disease at more than twice the rate of those who live in the wealthiest. Once age and geography have been taken into consideration, patients with Pakistani or black African heritage who have been treated for COVID-19 have died at roughly three times the rate of white patients. While the N.H.S. has not been overwhelmed by the outbreak, in April the country’s care-home system reported three thousand and ninety-six deaths in the space of seven days. After the 2008 financial crisis, public funding for adult social care in England fell by about fifteen per cent and has still not recovered. “We only knew about the first case because there was a sign on the door saying not to go in without a mask on,” an elder-care assistant told the Manchester Evening News last week, about an outbreak in her facility. When she started a recent shift, there were two masks for six carers. The other four wore towels on their faces. “We have to lie to families and tell them they were settled, comfortable and peaceful. We can’t tell the truth because it will break their hearts even more,” another nurse told the newspaper. “They have temperatures which create hallucinations, they are extremely agitated. They see people, animals, they try to grab out.”

Johnson’s government has done its utmost to frame the coronavirus like any other political challenge. Since the election of Tony Blair’s media-savvy New Labour administration, in the late nineties, there has been a sort of manual that British politicians have followed when faced with an insuperable problem. One technique is to invent objective-sounding “tests” for awkward decisions. In 1997, Blair’s chancellor, Gordon Brown, devised “five tests” for joining Europe’s single currency, which Britain somehow never quite passed. Another approach is to declare a bold, eye-catching target and make that the story. In 2010, David Cameron promised that he would reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.K. to fewer than a hundred thousand per year, something that he had neither the means nor the inclination to achieve. On April 16th, Johnson’s Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, duly set out the five tests for easing the lockdown, at least one of which—avoiding a second wave of infections that swamps the N.H.S.—seems like a hopeful guess, at best. Last week, the British media feverishly covered the race to perform a hundred thousand coronavirus tests per day by the end of April, the distracting goal set by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary. (The target was met by putting some fifty thousand tests in the mail on April 30th.) When outlets have investigated the government’s poor handling of the pandemic, they have been accused of bias and misreading the public mood. Last weekend, the Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, complained to the BBC about its reporting on the shortage of P.P.E.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-comforting-and-misleading-political-response-to-britains-coronavirus-disaster
"['John Cassidy', 'John Cassid', 'Charles Duhig', 'Isaac Chotine']",2020-05-05,The White House’s Push to Reopen the Economy This Early Is a Dangerous Gamble,"At the start of last week, Jonathan Swan, of Axios, reported that the “White House plans to shift its coronavirus messaging toward boosting the economy and highlighting ‘success stories’ of businesses, reducing its public emphasis on health statistics.” The story proved to be accurate. Rather than having Donald Trump appear at a daily coronavirus briefing, his staff set up a series of meetings with business leaders for him to attend. And this past weekend, the White House dispatched two of its economic advisers to appear on television.

“By the end of May, almost every state will be mostly open economically,” Kevin Hassett, a former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who recently rejoined the Administration, told Fox & Friends. “We are going to monitor the situation closely, but make no mistake about it, it’s really, really good news that we’ve been able to open up as soon as we have, and to do so according to the guidelines that doctors”—Deborah Birx, the coördinator of the White House coronavirus task force, and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—“set out.” Larry Kudlow, the head of the National Economic Council, echoed Hassett’s message. In appearances on CNN and Fox Business, Kudlow predicted that the economy would rebound strongly in the second half of the year, and he said that 2021 could be a “spectacular” year. During a virtual town hall held at the Lincoln Memorial, on Sunday night, Trump didn’t go quite that far. But he did insist that it is possible to end the shutdowns and reopen the economy while protecting the vulnerable. “I think you can really have it both ways,” he said.

With Florida, Missouri, and a number of other states allowing many businesses to reopen on Monday morning, the White House’s pivot from messaging about fighting the virus to promoting the economy seemed to be complete. According to a running tally that the Times maintains, twenty-four states in total had already ordered a partial reopening of their economies. But then came a pair of shocking developments.

At lunchtime on Monday, the Times published some details of an internal “situation update” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The update, which also bore the seal of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security, included a chart showing the number of daily deaths caused by COVID-19 rising steadily over the next month and reaching about three thousand—which is roughly seventy per cent more than the current level—by the start of June. Another chart showed the daily number of new cases rising to more than two hundred thousand during the same period, which would represent an even bigger increase in relative terms. In the past few days, the number of positive tests in the U.S. has averaged about thirty thousand, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

The White House quickly issued a statement distancing itself from the new projections and saying they hadn’t even been submitted to the coronavirus task force. “This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed,” the statement said. “The President’s phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious diseases experts in the federal government agreed with.”

Later on Monday, the Washington Post reported that the projections were the work of Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, who had showed his data to the C.D.C. “as a work in progress.” Lessler told the Post that his projections weren’t intended as a forecast, and he didn’t know how they ended up in the C.D.C. update. But Lessler also said that while “the exact numbers and charts in the CDC document may differ from the final results, they do show accurately how Covid-19 cases could spiral out of control.” According to the Post, “He said 100,000 cases per day by the end of the month is within the realm of possibility. Much depends on political decisions being made today.”

One thing we’ve learned over the past couple of months is not to place too much stock in any single set of projections. All such predictions are acutely sensitive to assumptions about things like social distancing, travel, and ease of transmission. But even if this particular set of simulations should be treated with caution, the consensus among medical experts is that reopening the economy while the virus is still spreading represents a risky strategy, and the earlier the reopenings take place, the greater the risks.

Also on Monday, the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, at the University of Washington, issued a new projection that showed the cumulative death total rising to a hundred and thirty-five thousand by early August—a big increase over the institute’s previous forecast, which was issued in April and predicted about sixty thousand deaths. “The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,” the institute, whose model some states rely on to help plan their medical needs, said in a press release. “Increases in testing and contact tracing, along with warming seasonal temperatures—factors that could help slow transmission—do not offset rising mobility, thereby fueling a significant increase in projected deaths.”

These warnings echoed statements by other experts and public-health officials, including one who used to work for the Trump Administration. In an op-ed published in Monday’s Wall Street Journal, Scott Gottlieb, who was the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration from 2017 to 2019, pointed out that while the shutdowns and social distancing have had a big effect in places like New York City, the national figures for deaths and new infections have stayed pretty steady over the past month. “Mitigation hasn’t failed; social distancing and other measures have slowed the spread,” Gottlieb wrote. “But the halt hasn’t brought the number of new cases and deaths down as much as expected or stopped the epidemic from expanding.” He added, “as states begin to open up their economies and Americans return to traveling, the disease will continue to expand.”

That doesn’t necessarily mean that reopening some parts of the economy is unjustified. The economic shutdown is also imposing huge costs, and governments throughout the world are looking for ways to reduce those costs while protecting the vulnerable and continuing to reduce the infection rate. The reopening guidelines that the White House task force issued in mid-April said states that want to relax their stay-at-home orders should meet a number of requirements. Among them were having a “robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing,” and insuring that “sentinel surveillance sites are screening for asymptomatic cases . . . at locations that serve older individuals, lower-income Americans, racial minorities, and Native Americans.”

In many parts of America, this essential preparatory work simply hasn’t been done. Nationwide, the level of testing is running at about two hundred and fifty thousand a day, which is far below the level that many independent medical experts recommend. Last week, some Harvard researchers and the health-news site STAT released a study of individual states, including ones that were planning to reopen soon. “To catch hot spots before they turn into wildfires of disease, Georgia must do 9,600 to 10,000 tests per day; it has been averaging around 4,000,” the study said. “Florida will need 16,000; in the last week it has been hitting just above 10,000.” Texas, which allowed many stores and restaurants to reopen last Friday despite a new case count that is still rising, is another big state that is doing far less testing than experts recommend.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-white-houses-push-to-reopen-the-economy-this-early-is-a-dangerous-gamble
"['Masha Gessen', 'Masha Gesse']",2020-05-05,The Political Consequences of Loneliness and Isolation During the Pandemic,"For many of us during the coronavirus pandemic, self-isolation describes the extent to which we can act to protect ourselves and others, solitude describes the best we can hope for, and loneliness describes what we actually feel. By “us,” I mean people who have the luxury of self-isolating, and the luxury of striving for solitude. Those who are not self-isolating—the doctors and nurses, the delivery workers who make the self-isolation of others possible—are, for most of their waking hours, often in a state of both isolation and loneliness, because they are deprived of the ability to choose their own company.

The most complicated and precise descriptions of isolation, solitude, and loneliness are offered by Hannah Arendt, in the last chapter of “The Origins of Totalitarianism.” Loneliness, Arendt posits, is the defining condition of totalitarianism and the common ground of all terror. Isolation and solitude flank loneliness as two related but distinct conditions. Arendt’s examples—slaves and the subjects of modern totalitarian states—are both isolated and lonely, but not alone. Isolation, she writes, “may be the beginning of terror; it certainly is its most fertile ground; it always is its result.” Isolation is the inability to act together with others, which, according to Arendt, is the source of a person’s political power. Isolation renders people impotent.

One can be lonely and not isolated, or isolated and not lonely. A person who is isolated cannot act with others, but still can act—still can create and send those creations out into the world. Loneliness is the inability to act altogether, either with others or alone. Arendt links loneliness to the states of uprootedness and superfluousness: having no place in the world, nothing to give to the world. This, in turn, is linked to the loss of what she calls “common sense”—the shared reality that allows us to know ourselves, to know where we end and the world begins, and how we are connected to others.

“We live without feeling the country beneath our feet // our words are inaudible from ten steps away,” the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam wrote, in 1933, summing up the state of totalitarian loneliness, the loss of sense of time and place, the disappearance of society and of any hope of being heard or seen. When there is no connection to others, there can be no voice. Arendt writes about isolation and loneliness as the preconditions, instruments, and products of tyranny. We, in the virtual “here” today, are not the subjects of a tyrant or a totalitarian regime, and the terror we have experienced is not wielded by human hands, although it is exacerbated by them. Yet Arendt’s observations on isolation and loneliness have a piercing resonance today that they didn’t have eight or twelve weeks ago.

Every Sunday, I meet my best friends in Moscow on Zoom. The loss of sense of time and space means that a seven-hour time difference has little impact on our ability to drink simultaneously, and the distance between us—a distance that used to be measured in kilometres, hours, and dollars required to traverse it—has become an abstraction. My friends in Moscow are functionally as close and as far as my friend whose house is a short bike ride away. (Her house is, but she is an image on the screen.) More strikingly, it has been a long time since my friends in Moscow and I have inhabited a shared reality—have had as much of a “common sense”—as we do now. We experience similar isolation, fear, helplessness, and anger. We compare notes on schools that do not teach, hospitals that do not heal, and governments that betray us.

Our conversations revolve around absences. We talk about the ways in which we don’t see people. I have been staying in the same town as my father and my oldest friend, without seeing them. When I finally saw my father, after seven weeks, we wore masks and stood far apart, making the familiar details of our faces invisible. Our muffled voices were barely audible ten steps away. With my friend on Zoom, whom I see more clearly, as long as she stays in the frame, we talk about the not seeing, the many ways of not knowing: what the tests mean, if anything; when this pandemic will be over; what the world will be like when it is.

Gradually, though, the ground seems to be seeping out from under those conversations. Our common sense is wearing thin. Or perhaps it’s becoming too thick: what we experience during our weeks of isolation may be a matter of common sense in that we are experiencing similar things, but these things are internal, intimate, difficult to articulate—it’s difficult, too, to know whether they should be put into words. For the first few weeks, we traded news and impressions of our lives, updating one another on the speed and manner of the shutdowns in our respective cities. We traded notes on experiencing shock or nostalgia at the intrusion of a sound or a sight from life before the pandemic, such as hearing the voices of a few drunken men together out in the street. Then the world faded away.

What constitutes a new experience now? A man I barely know tells me, during a professional conversation over Zoom, that he has not touched anyone in weeks and that his sexuality is atrophying. Another acquaintance, the art curator Ruth Noack, posts, on Facebook, “I just realized that I have not touched another living being, nor have I been touched, for more than 4 weeks. I wonder whether we will later on have split humanity into those who were touched and those who were not.” Those who are self-isolating in the company of others, meanwhile, have fights, doubts, highs and lows in their relationships, clashes about child rearing—all of the ways in which happy, unhappy, and fluctuating families, following a finite number of patterns under quarantine, create what common sense we have. We have always had these fights, fears, and heartaches in the intimate sphere, but they were generally shielded from the eyes of others. Now private lives are the only ones we are living. What does this do to friendship, which always, in its many meanings, straddles the boundary between private and public? Where is the boundary now, when all communal space is gone?

And what happens to the physical public spaces, while we leave them vacant? At the dawn of the era of self-isolation, in the initial burst of memes, songs, and other cultural productions, a Russian Web-based cartoon called “Masyanya,” which is now in its twentieth year of existence, posted an episode on the coronavirus.

Three months ago, Kai Wright, the host of WNYC’s “The United States of Anxiety,” joined David Remnick for a special episode of The New Yorker Radio Hour about the effects of mass incarceration and the movement to end it. Now, as the coronavirus pandemic puts inmates in acute and disproportionate danger, that effort may be gaining new traction. Wright and Remnick reconvene to examine the COVID-19 crisis in prison and its political effects. Remnick also speaks with Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, who has signed an executive order to release certain at-risk inmates from the state’s prisons—the sort of measure that would once have been deeply unpopular and risky. “I haven’t really spent any time on the politics,” Governor Murphy says. “In all the steps we’ve taken, we’re trying to make the call as best we can, based on the facts, based on the data, based on the science.” And Wright interviews Udi Ofer, the head of the A.C.L.U.’s Justice Division, who notes that “the communities that the C.D.C. has told us are most vulnerable to COVID-19 are exactly the communities that are housed in our nation’s jails and prisons,” including a disproportionately older population among inmates. Given the lack of social distancing in jails and prisons and, in many cases, substandard hygienic conditions, Ofer says that the need to reduce the inmate population “literally is a life-and-death situation.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/the-pandemic-is-wreaking-havoc-in-americas-prisons-and-jails

On April 1st, the musician Drew Daniel tweeted a request for people to send him recordings. He would take whatever people sent, he wrote, and stitch them together into a single track about daily life in the age of social distancing, cancelled school, and working (or not) from home. Daniel, who, along with his husband, M.C. Schmidt, makes up the electronic-music duo Matmos, thought that he would get maybe thirty submissions. In the first week, he got forty-five. In the second week, sixty. In the third, eighty. Files came from all over: Brooklyn, Kentucky, Italy, the Czech Republic, Kenya. Some were thirty seconds long or less; some stretched to thirty minutes. Some had descriptive labels—“roasting beets,” “eating apocalypse snacks”—and others were more mysterious. The final result, a fifteen-minute track called “Quarantine Supercut,” went live today at the Creative Independent, an arts Web site published by the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The project was originally conceived by Brandon Stosuy, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Creative Independent.

Daniel’s résumé made him the track’s perfect overseer (or, in his words, “stitch witch”). Multiple Matmos records were quilted together from piles of thematically similar audio samples. “Quasi-Objects” primarily features samples from around Daniel and Schmidt’s home. “A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure” is built around recordings of medical procedures. “Ultimate Care II” is composed entirely of sounds made by the couple’s Whirlpool Ultimate Care II laundry machine. Asking Daniel to take on the sounds of quarantine was almost comically apt, like asking Andy Warhol over to have a stab at painting your soup cans.

When I first spoke to Daniel, he was still working his way through all the submissions, sorting them into like piles—cat sounds here, homeschooling sounds here, coughs here—and formulating his plan of attack. He was enjoying himself, he told me, feeling like he was travelling without leaving his house in Baltimore, where he teaches English at Johns Hopkins University. But he couldn’t decide on a strategy: should he be aiming for something that would calm listeners down, he asked me rhetorically, or instead for a piece that spoke more fully to the unease and fears of so many isolated lives today?

In the end, he did a bit of both. The track’s opening movement has a soft, languorous vibe. Listening to it, I felt cast back to the earliest days of sheltering in place, when, despite the panic in the air, the whole thing had, for those not serving on the front lines, something of the novelty of a snow day or sick day. Ice clinks against glass. A drink is poured. An electric kettle hisses to life. A cat purrs. A neighborhood’s residents cheer for medical workers, or themselves, or both. Popcorn pops. “We could make bread!” someone says, excitedly.

Around the five-minute mark, though, the tension spikes. A yappy little dog yaps louder than anyone wants a yappy little dog yapping inside. A father pesters his daughter about homework; she tells him that she’s not in the mood. It doesn’t sound like their first time discussing the issue. A Zoom or FaceTime or Google Hangout or Skype meeting glitches. Listening to the speech distorting beyond the point of intelligibility, I felt my heart tightening. Quotidian domestic noises that would not have been out of place in the calm opening section start swirling together in a stereo-panned stress cocktail. “I don’t want to play monster trucks,” a young girl says. “And you’re not leaving me alone, Sam. I want a couple seconds just to myself!”

Things get calm again, but it’s not the same calm—especially because, in a dynamic that many will recognize, it’s hard not to find yourself waiting for everything to get stressful again. The virus itself only appears once, just before the ten-minute mark, when we hear someone listening online to instructions about how to prepare for a visit to a testing site. “The piece is not about the virus,” Daniel told me after he’d finished putting it together. “I’m not going to hospitals, and I’m not trying to do something vicarious about suffering. I’m more interested in social life, in what it’s like for the majority of people—people who aren’t sick or working in hospitals—to live through pandemics, which means moments of pleasure and moments of frustration. I don’t think quarantine has one mood. I think it has these tragic-comedic swerves.”

I won’t say how “Quarantine Supercut” ends—how its interplay of calm and claustrophobic disconnection resolves—just that I found myself surprised, on first listen, how much suspense I felt around the question. It was as if, having entered a simplified miniature model of our new normal, built entirely by snippets of representative sound, I was hoping that it would conclude by showing me the way out or revealing what happened next. This is, of course, too much to ask from fifteen minutes of sound, which in the end can only reveal so much. “Sometimes a potato chip crunching is just a potato chip crunching,” Daniel said. “Sometimes a cough is just a cough.” But sometimes it’s more than that.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/making-a-supercut-of-the-sounds-of-quarantine
"['Isaac Chotiner', 'Isaac Chotine']",2020-05-04,A New York Congressman Says Trump Shows No Malice,"Getting the testing going, you said?

Yeah, I’m saying once you got going, it is going. We were never built to be a national-testing country. It was always done by private labs and locals. Anyway, he is mobilizing that, and it was a slow start, but it has been slow all over the world, really, except maybe for South Korea or something, Taiwan.

So you have testing moving along, and, as far as supplying the states, if you could think back to a month ago, the feeling was there wouldn’t be enough ventilators, the hospitals would be overrun. And now you have Cuomo giving away ventilators. Now, that’s what was done as an executive. And when [Trump] gets into fights with reporters, sometimes it confuses the issue. Again, he has to realize that everything he says, people either take it seriously or they look at it seriously. I wouldn’t have said it if I were him, but, when he’s talking about Clorox or whatever it was, Lysol or something, could there be some element in those things that scientists could use? You know, just like when you inject chemotherapy into a person, that’s poison, but the scientists are able to refine it. I guess that’s what he meant.

Right. You have to give him the benefit of the doubt. He’s the President.

Yeah. I would think he would be better advised to just talk about what’s positive. Don’t be calling on Jim Acosta every week. It should be strictly science, strictly medicine, and exactly what we’re going to do.

I’m reading this book on Churchill now. You realize how many screwups there were. In the first month after Churchill became Prime Minister, and then after the United States got in the war, how many battles didn’t go the right way that we got engaged in? [Trump] shouldn’t let himself get bogged down about what he’s saying.

There could be a situation where we look back in four years and we say, “Look, there were mistakes about testing. There were mistakes about injecting disinfectants, but, fundamentally, he got the job done.”

Yeah. When somebody asks him, “Could the coronavirus come back worse in the fall?” Sure, it could. Instead of saying no, say, “We hope it doesn’t. But, believe me, we’re going to be ready for it. We learned our lesson. We’re going to have the testing, we’re going to be able to spot it early on. We’re going to be able to move our resources very quickly.”

I was reading an interview where you said, “There’s not many Republicans in Congress supporting President Trump on the gut issues. How many are out there defending him on Russia? Defending him on the travel ban? So that’s why those issues are gut issues I support him on.” It seems like there is a “gut” aspect of Trumpism that you two see eye to eye on, even if you don’t agree on every policy.

Yes, definitely. And the fact is that we’re roughly the same age. I’m a couple of years older. We both grew up in Queens. And when I see him, even with all his money and all that, he’s like guys I knew on the street corner in Queens.

You once said, “Guys I grew up with? They think he’s like one of the guys on the street corner. I mean he’s like—with all his billions and jets and hotels and golf courses—he’s very much the guy they hang out with.”

Yeah. And I find when I’m with him—and it’s not that often, I was at the wrestling match with him in the city, he invited me to that, and I’ve been with him a number of times—I have to keep reminding myself that this is the President, because he’s a regular guy. I mean, the language, the expressions, the faces, laughing and joking around. A smart guy, don’t get me wrong, but people sense that.

I first noticed this when he announced, in June, 2015. I’d be at my grandson’s Little League games, and there were people there who are level-headed guys, lawyers, accountants—regular middle-class, middle-income people, not overly political. They’re saying, “This guy Trump, I really like what he says.” I never really asked them exactly what it was they liked. They said, “He’s one of us”—like that. That was their tone.

The street-corner talk, or locker-room talk. That’s part of his personality.

Yeah. And it’s genuine. Again, you have people say he’s not a politician, but it goes beyond that. He’s used to the world where you say what you do to get through the day. You have to entertain—not entertain, you have to almost please the crowd you’re in front of. I remember, in 2016, when there was several times some excess in what he said, and I was talking to somebody in his headquarters about it. And they said, “Well, the thing is that he is at heart an entertainer, a salesman. Both.” So when he says something that’s funny or something that really strikes a chord with the crowd, his immediate attitude is, O.K., you like that, I’ll give you a better one. And he keeps upping the ante.

That can get into trouble with things like “Lock her up,” or when you say “Go back where you came from,” no?

Yeah, that’s part of it. There are some of the things he said. I didn’t see any malice in it, any of that.

No malice?

No, I don’t believe any malice. No, I mean, I’ve never seen malice in him.

Oh, O.K.

I don’t see it. Now, again, others may, but he seems sometimes genuinely surprised when people take offense to everything. To him, you have an argument, you’re back-and-forthing. You’re solid the next day.

Right. I think, with things like birtherism or Charlottesville, people saw a fair amount of malice in that.

Birtherism, I never really understood that. First of all, at the time, I guess there was always something in the back of your head. Anyone can be born out of the country, who knows? I assume—first of all, so what?

I think because President Obama is the first African-American President and—

Oh, I know. Look, I’m saying, “So what?” In that, to me, it never raised any kind of an issue. I wouldn’t have cared. I mean, if some guy’s mother happened to be out of the country the day he was born—in any event, so you know, why race? And I don’t know if it was even a racial issue so much as [Trump] could go after you on any issue. But, anyway, that’s subject to interpretation. I wouldn’t have raised birthplace, I never did.

And the Charlottesville stuff and the “Mexican” judge?

In Charlottesville, again, this is where he strings things together. I think he was trying to say there are some people who have legitimate, historical purposes. They think that you shouldn’t take down Robert E. Lee’s statue, or whatever.

Good people on both sides, right.

Yeah, both sides. But I think it was really three sides, if you will. Maybe there’s one side who had some historical beliefs that you shouldn’t be taking down people like Robert E. Lee, maybe a Jefferson Davis, I don’t know, Stonewall Jackson. But, on the other hand, there were also those who were racists and bigots and everything else. I think, whenever [Trump]’s challenged, he goes off the top. He says stuff off the top of his head. That, I think, in his mind was the “both sides.” Because I’ve never seen him or heard him say anything racist at all. I mean, in New York, he was—say, one area I would disagree with—he was a friend of Michael Jackson. I couldn’t stand Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson, he was living in Trump Tower for a while.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/a-new-york-congressman-says-that-trump-shows-no-malice
"['Charles Bethea', 'Charles Bethe', 'Brent Cran', 'Alice Gregor']",2020-05-05,Teen Crisis Counsellors Are Still On Call,"McCaleb Nesseler-Cass Illustration by João Fazenda

On a recent Thursday, in Portland, Oregon, McCaleb Nesseler-Cass got out of bed five minutes before his ten o’clock check-in at Central Catholic High School. “It doesn’t compare to real school,” he said of the online version. He went back to sleep. After lunch, he headed to the basement to lift weights. “Self-care,” he said. “I’ve got my weights. I’ve got my video games. And sanitizing carts at Trader Joe’s,” where he works on the weekends. (“Makes people feel better.”) After an hour of reading about “the five pillars of Islam,” and a couple playing Super Smash Bros., he got into his Toyota Sienna, cranked up “Althea”—Grateful Dead, 1980—and drove to an office where he volunteers at YouthLine, a crisis line for teens.

“It’s not for school or anything,” McCaleb, who is eighteen, said. “Men, especially, hide their feelings. I just try to support them.” He wore a tie-dyed Dead T-shirt, jeans, and skater shoes, on which he’d scrawled, “People who do this suck.” Irony. He arrived at the office, where seven other teen-age volunteers—all girls—were seated and masked at their spaced-out desks. A supervisor pointed a thermometer gun at McCaleb’s forehead. “You’re good,” she said. McCaleb masked up and said hi to a schoolmate named Maddi, who was wearing knee-high boots and had pasted rhinestones around her eyes.

In March, YouthLine received nearly twenty-two hundred messages and calls, compared with around fourteen hundred twelve months earlier. The virus has necessitated a larger room. “More space is dope,” McCaleb said. The air was thick with the scent of hand sanitizer and the sound of typing. Also, Beyoncé.

After wiping down his desk, McCaleb checked the messages on his computer. “This person is a preteen,” he said, examining the first one. “They’re having trouble with their gender identity.” He added, “They’re really scared to tell their parents while quarantined.” McCaleb typed a response. “They asked me how old I am,” he said—a question that the volunteers frequently get from callers. “I said I’m in high school. I didn’t want to say I’m eighteen—that could be kind of imposing.” (Later, he gently told another caller, “I’m not an adult,” but the caller didn’t believe him, and hung up.) McCaleb turned to schoolwork while he waited for another message to ping. “I have this A.P. Bio video lecture on DNA,” he said. “Which is annoying.”

Maddi said, “When I was here last week, I had two contacts talk about the virus pretty much the whole time.” They felt trapped. Maddi, who lives in an apartment with her mother, related—to a point. “One was talking about how it was making them feel even more suicidal,” she said. “They were into writing, so I said it would be really fun to write letters to friends or family.” The idea seemed to take.

To Maddi’s left, Sophie, seventeen, who wore a baggy sweatshirt, played Animal Crossing on her Nintendo Switch between calls. “You live on a little island with all these animals,” she said of the game. “You, like, fish and catch bugs. It’s really cute and stress-relieving.” She talked about recent chats. “I’ve gotten abusive situations,” she said. “Now they can’t get out and go to school and escape that. They ask, ‘How long is this gonna be?’ ”

Nearby, Beth, another seventeen-year-old, wearing an olive crop top, responded to a new message. “Are you in crisis now?” she typed. “This is the crisis line.” The person, who was nine, had tried to snuggle a pet mouse during an anxious moment in quarantine, and had inadvertently choked the animal. “They’re suicidal,” Beth told Morgan, a middle-aged woman supervising the group.

“You’re amazing and wonderful,” Morgan replied, “but I’m going to take that.” After a moment, Morgan ascertained that the creature had survived. “It’s sleeping now in its cage,” she said.

A veteran volunteer across the room ended a call. “It’s so wild how some people just don’t have boundaries,” she said to the others, sighing. She took another call, this time recommending a hot bath or shower. “The other thing I’d maybe recommend,” she continued, “is an app called Calm Harm, which can sometimes help when you’re having really intense self-harm urges.”

Beth took another call. It lasted awhile. A seventeen-year-old had gone to her doctor to get tested for the virus and learned she was pregnant. “Awful timing,” Beth said to the caller, after calming her down.

McCaleb’s last chat was with a teen-ager whose sibling had recently died by suicide. “Their parents aren’t very responsive,” he said. “Like, a pat on the back and ‘You’re good.’ ” He shook his head. “Virus or no virus, it’s just hard.” He listened to “Althea” again on the drive home. The name, he later learned, means “healer.” ♦

"['Ethan Kuperberg', 'Ethan Kuperber', 'Kaitlin Cha', 'Cora Frazie']",2020-05-05,Quarantine Stew,"There’s nothing quite as meditative as cooking—it might be the only thing keeping me sane right now! This hearty stew serves five, which is perfect for my current household: me, my cat, my two porcelain dolls that have begun speaking to me, and my porcelain doll that is currently not speaking to me owing to a misunderstanding.

PREP TIME:

30 min, or a few days—what’s the difference?

INGREDIENTS:

• 3 bottles red wine

• 1 pound beef (you may substitute ice cream)

• 6 teaspoons vegetable oil

• 7 teaspoons vegetable oil if you’re feeling naughty

• 2 bay leaves

• 2 Lexapro tablets (crushed)

• 3 1/ 2 cups beef broth (you may substitute ice cream)

• Some carrots and onions or whatever. It doesn’t matter.

PREPARATION:

• Wash the onions to make sure they’re clean. Everything must be clean! Scrub them vigorously under scalding hot water with Lysol or bleach.

• Drink first bottle of red wine.

• Place the beef (or ice cream) in a large pot. Turn the news on, see a headline, then immediately turn the news off. You don’t need that right now!

• Cook the beef until it is browned on all sides. While doing this, sing Stephen Sondheim’s “Send in the Clowns” to yourself, loudly. Puzzle over why you’re only realizing now, once you’re in quarantine, that you could have pursued singing professionally. Isn’t that rich?

• Slice the onions and add them to the pot. Wait, these aren’t onions, they’re apples. Have they been apples this whole time? Is there that big of a difference between an apple and an onion, anyway?

• Slice the apples and add them to the pot.

• Call your parents and tell them that you are a chef now. Let them know that they should call you Chef, because that is your new name. Learn that your parents left the house today to deposit a check at the bank, even though they are both over sixty. Yell at them until you are all sobbing, then hang up the phone.

• Simmer.

• Add cilantro to the pot. To you, cilantro tastes like soap. But who cares? It’s the end of the world. Hey, add some real soap, too!

• Take everything else that is still in your produce drawer and throw it into the air. Whatever lands in your stew is now part of your stew! Life is random and cruel; so, too, your stew shall be!

• Reduce heat and drink fourth bottle of red wine.

• Feel offended that your cat is mocking your cooking abilities. Tell your cat that you’re under a lot of pressure right now, and she’s not going to get any stew if she calls you a philistine again. It’s hurtful.

• Almost forgot the bay leaves. Add them—to your mouth! They taste very weird. Eat the rest of the bay leaves in your pantry, and also the paprika.

• Receive text message from your parents about your fight from three days ago. Hold on, how long have you been cooking this stew for?

• Almost done! Cover pot for ten minutes, or until you feel like taking the lid off and wearing it as a hat. Ouch, your new hat feels extremely hot on your head!

• Ladle stew among five bowls while calling your parents back and telling them that you love them, to taste.

Buon appetito! Your stew is all done. Put some clothes on and enjoy! ♦

"['Françoise Mouly', 'Françoise Moul']",2020-05-05,Christoph Mueller’s “Shelter in Place”,"The coronavirus has hit different countries in different ways, but billions of people worldwide are now living with some kind of restriction on public life. This week’s cover, by Christoph Mueller, an artist based in Germany, portrays a now common experience: seeing life, and the bloom of spring, through a window. We talked to Mueller recently about the image.

Europe has been in quarantine for more than a month. Have you still been able to enjoy strolls in nature? And, if so, how has the experience shifted?

My wife, Leonie, and I live close to the Dutch border, and our favorite getaway is a small heathland nature reserve in the Netherlands. It’s an incredibly beautiful place that has an almost spiritual effect on me. Unfortunately, nonessential people are not allowed to cross the borders at the moment, so we’ve switched to taking our strolls through small local parks. They’re nice, but I do miss those Dutch pines. Fortunately, we had a chance to collect some seeds during our last visit to the heathlands, and we’re now growing a pine forest in the living room of our apartment.

Has sheltering in place made you more or less aware of what’s going on outside your window?

Much more aware—and I mean that quite literally. I’ve developed a habit of looking out the window right after I get up in the morning: I step into the living room, greet Wembley and Schlomi, our two cockatiels, and stare outside the window for a while, almost like I am searching for some sort of confirmation, for signs of normality, some real-life feedback that lets me know that we’ll be O.K. for another day. After that, I check on our baby pines and make coffee.

Does your approach shift when you set out to tell a story in one image, like this cover, versus a comic strip?

I don’t think I’ve ever thought about that. Usually, I start with the specs of what I’m aiming for, do my research, and keep thinking about it until I arrive at some sort of emotional starting point. Then the image or images just sort of work their way through my hand onto the paper. I try to not overthink the underlying mechanics too much.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2020-05-11
"['Lauren Collins', 'Lauren Collin', 'Victor Zapana', 'Alexander Maksi']",2020-05-05,Reinventing Grief in an Era of Enforced Isolation,"Father Michael, a priest my family has never met, in a city we never identified, gave my father a version of the last rites over the telephone on the night of April 4th. My father, John Collins, had received a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia in January. After spending nearly two months undergoing chemotherapy at Duke University Medical Center, in Durham, North Carolina, he was finally discharged from the hospital in mid-March, just as the coronavirus pandemic broke out. He and my mother, Sue, returned to their home in Wilmington. Everyone was scrambling. There were cancelled appointments, appointments rescheduled for Zoom; Zoom appointments cancelled, too, when my father’s new, outpatient doctors, having determined that it was too risky for him to continue commuting to Durham, acknowledged that they couldn’t very well devise a treatment plan without being able to physically examine him.

The coronavirus may have accelerated his decline, or it may not have. Leukemia was the disease at fault. Still, the demands on medical personnel, amid the general chaos, made recovering at home dangerous and dying at home unworkable. On the afternoon of April 3rd, my father entered a hospice center. He had not been a churchgoer in recent years, and hadn’t attended a Catholic church since adolescence. Still, we knew that last rites were something he wanted, so we tried hard to make it happen. In the course of the evening and the next day, my mother called “a zillion friends” to try to rustle up a Catholic officiant. No one local would come. Her friend’s sister-in-law’s acquaintance finally found a willing Father Michael somewhere in California. “Just heard from one priest who does not know how to do FaceTime,” the friend’s sister-in-law texted. “He’s now checking with another priest. If he’s tech savvy, he can do all except the anointing.”

I learned about this when I woke up in Paris on April 5th and checked my WhatsApp messages. “Sorry you missed it, but had to take the call when he rang,” my mother had written, referring to the priest, at 2:39 A.M. I should have had my ringer on. I had also missed a video call at 6:11, and one at 6:13. I called my mother at 6:19, and she told me that my father had died. It took me a few minutes to switch on the light in my bedroom, during which time I appeared to my mother in the form of a pitch-black rectangle. She asked if I wanted to see him, and, not really knowing whether I did, I said yes. First, she aimed the camera at the door (“Mom, that’s the door”), and then she turned it toward the bed, where my father’s body lay. The bad lighting and the slow connection produced greenish, unfiltered alloys of pixel and flesh.

Despite having lived abroad for a decade, I’d always thought of FaceTime as a weak substitute for first-order interaction, whether in person or in writing. Like Diet Coke, it was to be avoided except when there were no other decent options. Better to have the real thing, less frequently, than to settle for constant interruptions and glitches. Video calls are unsatisfying not just because of the lack of touch but because they require mutual active presence. Conversation is only a part of companionship. It’s hard to just be when you’re on a call, hard to see when you’re constantly looking.

Because of the coronavirus, I was quarantined in France. When we’d last pushed for a prognosis, in early March, my father’s doctors had guessed that he had somewhere between a year and eighteen months left to live. I had a ticket home for March 19th, but, after the pandemic hit, we decided to postpone the visit. Soon, though, it became clear that my father’s condition was deteriorating. The doctors could see it in his blood-cell counts, but I understood that he was dying when, one afternoon, my kids demanded that he do the Funky Chicken, as he often did for them on FaceTime. After a knockout performance—elbows flapping, knees knocking, bent low enough that he could reach down and slap the floor—he collapsed back into his deck chair, and said that he needed to sleep.

Shopping Cartoon by Bruce Eric Kaplan

I tried to find a way to join him, my mother, and my brother, who lives in Wilmington with his wife and young children. One flight a day was still operating from Paris to the United States. On April 4th, it was headed to Los Angeles. On the fifth, it was going to J.F.K., landing in New York in the late afternoon. To get to Wilmington, I would then either rent a car and drive ten hours or spend the night in a hotel, take a taxi to LaGuardia the next morning, and catch two more flights. In the end, these were fantasy itineraries, dark mirrors of the vacations that people have passed the pandemic imagining in extravagant detail, as a way to transcend confinement and the powerlessness that comes with it. Even if I made it home in time to see my father, I might transmit the coronavirus to my mother, who is seventy, or to other people. I might get stranded, or sick myself, in a country where I don’t have health insurance. Staying in Paris went against all my instincts, but going seemed foolhardy.

The hospice was in lockdown, but it allowed immediate family members to visit at the end of life. A mercy, and a privilege: my father wouldn’t die alone. On his last afternoon, my mother and brother sat at his bedside, occasionally putting an iPhone close to his right ear, the good one, so that I could talk to him. This was a warm moment, the best simulacrum of togetherness that we could create. But it was also distressing for me, because my father wasn’t responding, and my mother and brother couldn’t tell when I was done trying to communicate. I listened while Dad gasped for breath, waiting for someone to reclaim the phone. The ethics of attending to the dying by device are still being written. Do you mute something like that if you can?

The screen, as screens do, kept framing little pictures—grainy grotesques that I wished I could unsee. Still, I eventually took a screenshot, because I was worried about forgetting all the things that, not being there, I hadn’t had a chance to internalize. It showed my dad, his mouth bruised and bleeding a little, dressed in a weirdly pretty white gown with a dark-blue motif that reminded me of chrysanthemums. He was lying in a bed with handles. Three electrical outlets, one of them red, were visible above his head. The image kept popping up in my camera roll every time I tried to send a message or post something. I wanted to delete it, but that felt like another kind of desecration. I ended up e-mailing it to myself, just to get it off my phone, and putting it in an unnamed folder.

As I spoke to my mother on the morning of the fifth, a nurse came into the room to tell her that my father’s possessions—white socks, a phone charger—would be returned to her. The nurse also presented her with a list of undertakers. I listened in, looking, again, at some random door. “They’re awesome, they did my dad,” the nurse’s disembodied voice said, of one mortuary. Unable to see her face, I couldn’t decide what to make of that, so, tuning out, I wandered onto WhatsApp. In the space of three thumb scrolls, my conversations with my dad had gone from “I will stand, this will pass and we will embrace again before you know it” to “I hit my head—so I am in the / JWejhosp.” The final screen showed two pictures I had sent him of my kids, marked “seen” by pairs of blue checks.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/reinventing-grief-in-an-era-of-enforced-isolation
"['James Ross Gardner', 'James Ross Gardne']",2020-05-04,The End of the Beginning: Seattle Braces for the Next Phase of the Coronavirus Fight,"Social-distancing measures have helped Seattle, but officials warn that a sense of complacency could bring the virus roaring back.

We’d reached that moment in the plot where the bad thing has set in, when the characters, while not yet embracing the new reality, have resigned themselves to it. A collective sigh. A pensive scratch of the beard, if you could still safely scratch beards. We were quarantining just like everywhere else in the country; the difference in Seattle was we’d been doing it half a month longer, maybe more. In the first region with a confirmed case, the first to log a death, we’d grown used to this retreat from the world. The walls of our homes flickered from the light on our screens. During the day, those screens filled with images of our co-workers’ laundry piles, and, at night, with the stories we binged, like the one about the man who imprisons cats and plots the death of his rival.

You could still go to the grocery store, and when you did you marvelled at what you saw, mostly because here, at last, things transpired somewhere other than on a screen, but also because there was more kindness out there than you recalled. The employee at the entrance who offered to wipe down the handle of your shopping cart. The cashier who stage-managed the line of customers so no one stood too close. Except for emergencies, hospitals were off limits, but you had your memory and imagination. You could take all the times you’d been near an E.R. or I.C.U.—the intensity, the texture of a crisis, its sounds and smells—and imprint upon them the news of the day, then just speed things up, turn up the dials. It wasn’t hard to picture a hundred acts of heroism.

After all, this was why we’d so abruptly upended our lives. We knew we must slow the spread of the coronavirus to grant health-care workers some relief, to flatten the curve, make sure enough ventilators and empty beds remained. So when it was all finally, demonstrably shown to be effective, the joy was palpable. On March 30th, at the end of what was certainly among the strangest months in Seattle’s history, the data company that supplied many of the models upon which the region’s leaders had weighed decisions made an announcement. “Social distancing and mobility reductions have reduced COVID-19 transmission in King County, WA,” the Institute for Disease Modeling stated in a publicly distributed summary paper. I.D.M.’s calculations showed that, between the end of February and mid-March, the spread rate had been cut by nearly half: before, each infected Seattleite passed the virus on to an estimated 2.7 people; on March 18th it was 1.4. Two weeks later, I.D.M. had even better news: someone with COVID-19 in late March could be expected to infect just one other individual.

Maintaining an invisible six-foot barrier between yourself and others. Washing your hands with obsessive frequency. So much time spent indoors that you’d practically committed to memory the ceiling’s cartography of cracks and bumps. After a while, these measures could feel like spells, charms to ward off supernatural forces. You believed in them because they came from women and men of science, but you’d be lying if you said you weren’t also running on something like blind faith.

Now there was the confirmation. What we did was working. To calculate the rate of the virus’s spread, the I.D.M. researchers measured public epidemiological data—including tests, diagnoses, and reported deaths—against mobility data gathered from anonymous Facebook users. The latter showed that Seattleites were indeed avoiding big gatherings and staying home; the scientists noted a twenty-seven-per-cent increase in daytime residential occupancy compared to before the social-distancing policies began, and a forty-three-per-cent decrease in occupancy in mixed-use places like downtown. There were other signs: King County Metro reported its bus ridership down forty-five per cent. Traffic on Interstate 5 fell by more than half. By April 5th, we appeared to have avoided one of the more dreaded outcomes: another research group, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, at the University of Washington, lowered its projection of deaths. It also reported a surplus rather than a deficit of available hospital beds, including I.C.U. beds. Governor Jay Inslee was so confident in the numbers, he sent back more than four hundred of the ventilators that the Strategic National Stockpile had loaned the state; New York, in more dire need, could put them to use instead.

Of course, every bit of promising news came with big caveats. We were far from in the clear, officials warned. We still are. Any time now the high spread rate could come roaring back, especially if we relax social-distance measures too soon. New confirmed cases emerge every day, as do high death tolls. People on the front line still lack proper personal protective equipment. But decelerating the virus did more than provide much-needed relief to the region’s health-care system. It offered some time, however brief, to reflect on how we’d done it.

As my colleague Charles Duhigg recently wrote in the magazine, the largest factor was relatively simple: state and local leaders here listened to the advice of scientists. Officials quickly shuttered schools and issued shelter-in-place orders. Other, harder-to-quantify factors may have helped as well. Every city has its contradictions. Seattle’s may be trickier to parse than most. Inexplicably, its residents are both civically dutiful and unfriendly. That’s according to the statistics provided by the National Conference on Citizenship, which combines census data and survey results to create its Civic Health Index.

In 2017, when measured against fifty other cities, Seattle came in either first or second in philanthropy, group participation, and the boycotting of products for ethical or political purposes. Seattleites also rank high for voter turnout. Yet, when it comes to talking to neighbors, residents ranked an abysmal thirty-fifth; though that’s up from three years earlier, when the rank was forty-eighth.

Could these two characteristics—civic duty and aloofness—help explain the city’s success with social distancing? Diane Douglas, a former executive director of Seattle City Club, which co-sponsors the index, thinks so. At least the civic-duty aspect. She’s more circumspect when it comes to the Seattle Freeze, the sobriquet by which the city’s reputation for unfriendliness is known. (Duhigg briefly touched on this as well.) When we spoke, Douglas emphasized the jump in the city’s rank in friendliness (presumably because of the influx of outsiders moving here).

Since at least the nineteen-forties, the city has taken hits for its alleged icy treatment of newcomers, as observed in archival letters to the editor from newspaper readers confessing to toils like “nearly dying of sheer loneliness for months.” Such missives led the Seattle Daily Times to aver, in a 1946 editorial, “that newcomers do not always find us altogether perfect; that we sometimes are neglectful of the stranger in our midst; that we seem unduly preoccupied with our own local concerns.” Nearly sixty years later, the same newspaper, in a 2005 article about the Seattle Freeze—likely the first time the term was committed to print—characterized the phenomenon this way: locals are “polite but distant,” or, put another way, “Have a nice day. Somewhere else.”

What makes Seattle dwellers less sociable than those in other cities? Explanations are frustratingly few and largely unsatisfying. Some posit the influence of long-timers who hail from stereotypically stoic parts of the world. (Such hypotheses unsubtly implicate the region’s large Nordic and Asian communities.) Some explanations blame the preponderance of socially inept tech workers (which hardly accounts for why the phenomenon has lingered since the pre-tech-boom forties). Still others blame the melancholy brought on by constant overcast skies. (Constant overcast skies get blamed for a lot in the Pacific Northwest.)",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-end-of-the-beginning-seattle-braces-for-the-next-phase-of-the-coronavirus-fight
"['Anthony Lane', 'Anthony Lan', 'Adam Gopni', 'Evan Osno']",2020-05-05,The Enduring Romance of the Night Train,"You can still buy plain seats on the Caledonian Sleeper, and they cost a fraction of the single or double rooms. The economics of night trains, in Europe and elsewhere, rest on two basic theorems. First, the closer you adhere to the perpendicular, the less you pay. An upright vigil in the corridor, during which you stare into the darkness and contemplate the infinite, is dirt cheap. Second, once you do lie flat, communal flatness is better value than solitude. The standard compromise is the couchette, a compartment fitted with four or six bunks: fun for a family, and rousingly unpredictable when you get tossed into a stew of strangers. Urban legends abound. Hands are said to reach up from the bunk beneath you, in response to your telltale snores, and deftly extract your wallet. And I once heard of a roving youth who, ensconced with newfound companions in a friendly couchette, was offered a cup of coffee in southern Bulgaria and woke up, two days later, in a quiet siding outside Thessaloniki, devoid of every possession except his boxer shorts. You just don’t get that level of service on a plane.

Not that high-end sleepers are devoid of risk. Habitués of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, for example, which, in defiance of its name, can shuttle you from Paris to Istanbul, are encouraged to “trade stories with fellow travellers in the Bar Car as the pianist plays.” Imagine hearing the same anecdote, from the same retired fund manager, all the way across a continent. Should you book the Cabin Suite, “formed of two interconnecting Double Cabins,” you will be granted the unique opportunity for a blazing, champagne-fuelled argument with your beloved on the first night. Having slammed the connecting door, both of you can then sulk in ultimate luxury for five long days, and all for thirty-seven thousand dollars. Each.

There’s no disguising the itch that drives the Caledonian Sleeper. It wants to be a hotel. Such is the lofty ambition on which the principle of the sleeping car is based. The pioneer of that principle was George Pullman. Not since Monsieur Guillotin came up with a device for making decapitation more user-friendly has an individual been so closely associated with a product. Pullman, born in 1831, was an engineer whose idea of a challenge was to jack up whole buildings in the mud-bound streets of Chicago, allowing drainage systems to be installed underneath. A similar aversion to mess and inconvenience was one of the motives that spurred him to introduce the Pullman sleeping car, in 1859. Ladies and gentlemen, he reasoned, would pay to travel in comfort; the plusher the comfort, the more swiftly his clients might forget that they were travelling at all. On his much improved model, of 1865, the upholstered seats were indeed covered in plush, to accompany the brass fittings and the walnut walls.

As if to demonstrate that nothing, not even tragedy, could interrupt the national genius for entrepreneurship, the funeral train that carried the body of Abraham Lincoln from Washington to Springfield, Illinois, included a Pullman car on the final leg of its journey. By then, the train, which had crossed seven states, had become a story unto itself. The market followed the mourning, and, in 1867, the Pullman Palace Car Company was founded. The wealthy, and the aspiring middle classes, were offered the chance to sleep in peace, on the move, much as their national hero had been borne to his eternal rest. The deal would be sealed when his eldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln, was made president of Pullman, in 1897, and then, in 1911, chairman of the board.

The gradual upgrading of Pullman cars can be read as a fever chart of consumers’ wants. In 1887, a vestibule was inaugurated which allowed smooth access from one carriage to another and led to such delights as the drawing room and the smoking room, aromatic with domesticity. Women travellers, growing in number, were provided with dressing rooms. Air-conditioning began to flow in 1929, and the nineteen-thirties saw the début of the Duplex and the Roomette—not a word that I could nerve myself to utter in front of a booking clerk, but, qua period detail, it has the right snap and click. In “Night Trains,” a lovingly erudite book of 2017, Andrew Martin reports that Pullman cars were also “equipped with hairdressing salons, organs (for church services) and libraries.” When a train can meet every private and civic need, why would you ever get off?

Of particular note, throughout this process, was the deployment of the beds. In America, the custom was to place them lengthways, so that your body, when horizontal, slotted into the train like a bullet in the breach of a rifle. If you want to see this arrangement at work, its neatness crying out for comic disruption, I refer you to “Some Like It Hot,” in which Sweet Sue and her band, topped by a singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), take the sleeper from Chicago to Florida. Arrayed on either side of the car’s central corridor are ranks of bunks, upper and lower, each of them guarded, demurely but uselessly, by curtains. A nocturnal party is thrown in bunk No. 7, with Manhattans mixed in a rubber hot-water bottle. You can keep your Orient Express.

In Europe, on the other hand, bunks on a night train have traditionally been set at ninety degrees to the direction of travel, like the teeth of a comb. (Of the many gulfs between the Old World and the New, this could be the most bewildering. Do American passengers, made of sterner purpose, prefer the thrustful sensation of being propelled?) A photograph from 1888 shows a private compartment, with two of the transverse bunks in place and primed for action. Every surface, including the floor and the mattresses, is sumptuously patterned and softened, as if to induce a languid hush. The name for such a haven was a “boudoir car,” and you can see why, for it breathes what one prim and titled Englishwoman scorned as “the atmosphere of vulgar depravity” that prevailed on trains de luxe. Her name, by the way, was Lady Chatterley.

To pick your way through the vestiges of the great European trains is a task not so much for historians of transport as for paleontologists. It is a lost world, in which Tsar Nicholas II could have a cow car, if you please, attached to his personal train on a visit to Germany, to keep the imperial children furnished with fresh milk. The landscape of this Trainaceous Era was crammed with rogues, chancers, visionaries, and tightfisted despots. Meet Colonel William d’Alton Mann, formerly of the Fifth Michigan Cavalry, who devised the boudoir car; King Boris of Bulgaria, who wore white overalls and stood next to the engine driver for hours on end, aflame with train lust; and Georges Nagelmackers, the indefatigable Belgian who founded La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (et des Grands Express Européens) at the age of twenty-seven. The trains running under that banner were majestic beasts, and some of the dominant predators are listed by Andrew Martin:",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/the-enduring-romance-of-the-night-train
"['Antonia Hitchens', 'Antonia Hitchen', 'Lizzie Widdicomb', 'Malcolm Gladwel']",2020-05-05,Was Quarantine Made for Cannabis?,"Illustration by João Fazenda

Late last month, while President Trump flirted with solutions to the coronavirus—sunbathing with a “very powerful light,” injecting Lysol to clean the lungs—others elected to smoke pot. In Los Angeles, as a queue of cars crept slowly in a two-hour In-N-Out Burger drive-through line, in Hollywood, a string of people, standing six feet apart, snaked down the block outside the MMD cannabis dispensary.

Mishka Ashbel, who co-owns the dispensary with his brother, Slava, said, “We get to provide a little relief to a stressed society.” Los Angeles, which shuttered its beaches and hiking trails, has deemed weed an essential service, critical to residents’ health and well-being. “On 4/20, a lot of people used coming to a dispensary as an excuse to get out of the house, to feel normal again,” Ashbel said. “To stand in that line was like a special occasion. People placed online orders for delivery starting at 4 A.M.” (Seniors get their gummies, organic pre-rolled joints, and edibles delivered free.)

“Vice industries,” such as the liquor business, do well during recessions and crises; in the first days of the shutdown, marijuana stocks outperformed the crashing S. & P. Ashbel does not consider cannabis a vice product. “This is a health product,” he said. “You feel this responsibility to the public here—we’re on the front lines. It’s uncharted territory.”

A former N.F.L. player was reprimanded by the F.D.A. for advocating cannabis as a cure for COVID-19, but many have found it crucial in coping with the pandemic. David Lonsdale, the C.E.O. of a hemp-cultivation company called CanaFarma, weighed in by phone from his Manhattan apartment. “People are looking at an over-all wellness program,” he said. “Cannabis becomes part of your daily routine, like blood-pressure medicine.”

“People are used to self-medicating, and it’s medical, yeah,” a Broadway actor who works part time as a budtender said. “But people are also just bored.”

Rudy Schreier, a cannabis consultant, said, “You wake up, you have a good breakfast, you maybe take some vitamins, you do work, you have lunch, do more work, smoke a joint, eat an edible. It’s becoming the norm since we’ve been on lockdown.” Schreier works with dispensaries to help them secure licenses. “A lot of people working from home have more time on their hands now,” he said. “In a world that’s so hectic, everyone’s wish was to have more time, and now that that wish has been granted people are, like, ‘I don’t know what to do.’ That’s where cannabis comes into play.” He went on, “I live in a house with seven other people, and during the quarantine we’ve had a couple of girlfriends here, too, so it’s like twelve of us, and pretty much everyone is smoking every day. People finish whatever they have to do for their job at, like, 2 P.M., and they’re, like, ‘What are we going to do for the rest of the day?’ ”

Schreier rushed out to two dispensaries the day that L.A.’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, advised residents to begin staying home. Since then, he’s put two cloned baby cannabis plants in his back yard. “I think that Lowe’s and Home Depot have a surge in sales, and I assume that part of that is gardening supplies,” he said. “We expect home-grows to go way up.”

There’s a side benefit to the boom: the process of extracting cannabis oil requires ethanol, so manufacturers have started producing hand sanitizer in bulk to supply the dispensaries, for customers to use. “At first, it was like a back-yard drug deal for hand sanitizers,” Ashbel said.

Ashbel thinks that smoking pot is the ideal quarantine activity. “It’s conducive to isolation, and it turns off the sensory overload from the news right now,” he said. His brother, Slava, said, “Smoking cannabis has helped people stay inside for generations!” He added, “I didn’t realize I’ve been quarantined full time since 2006.”

Mark Haskell Smith, a novelist who has written about the marijuana industry, agrees. “How else are you going to play eight hours of video games?” he said. He celebrated 4/20 by smoking a joint during a special holiday Pilates class on Zoom.

Mishka Ashbel makes a point of educating his customers about safe smoking during the pandemic. “We’re telling people, ‘Don’t pass the doob around,’ ” he said. One dispensary’s Web site offers a guide for hygienic toking: “Use protection. . . . Bong condoms slip right into the top of a bong so you don’t have to put your mouth where someone else’s was.” Another thing to watch out for, Ashbel noted: “You might end up eating all of your quarantine food supplies.” ♦

"['Isaac Chotiner', 'Isaac Chotine']",2020-05-03,Paul Romer’s Case for Nationwide Coronavirus Testing,"One of the biggest questions every country faces is how to reopen businesses without causing a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Paul Romer, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who has served as the chief economist at the World Bank, has been putting forward plans to mitigate the economic fallout from the coronavirus and to allow for a return of normal economic activity in the U.S. His main proposal is to offer bimonthly tests to every person in the country, allowing more of us to go about our daily lives safely. But testing is still short of where it needs to be, and we may be facing an economic crisis akin to the Great Depression.

I recently spoke by phone with Romer, who is a professor at N.Y.U. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed why Americans may be resistant to digital contact tracing, the need for states to administer tests, and what lessons economists have learned from the crisis.

Over a month ago, you co-wrote an Op-Ed for the New York Times that stated, “To protect our way of life, we need to shift within a couple of months to a targeted approach that limits the spread of the virus but still lets most people go back to work and resume their daily activities.” Are we anywhere close to that approach? And, if not, is our way of life at risk?

We’re not much closer, no. We’ve made very little progress, and I think we are running some risks here. There’s a difference between saying “Here’s something which is likely” and “Here’s something that’s possible, but it’s so bad we have to start preventing it and avoiding that risk right away.” And that’s what I’m trying to say about the possibility that a depression worse than the Great Depression could lead to political turmoil that could do long-lasting damage to the nation. So I think we have to proceed with urgency to try and solve both the health crisis and the economic crisis, and I’m not surprised that we haven’t made a lot of progress yet. But I will tell you that I’m actually encouraged by the decision by Congress to spend twenty-five billion dollars for testing in the phase-three bill. [This allocation is part of Phase 3.5.] That was not what most people were expecting a few weeks ago, and it happened.

What is your biggest fear about the economy right now?

There was some analysis that was done at the St. Louis Fed, going through job categories and just thinking about the employment consequences of physical lockdown and social distancing. Their conclusion was that we were going to be at an unemployment rate above thirty per cent, so that was the early-warning sign that we’re headed for an economic catastrophe that’s worse than the Great Depression.

Different people have talked about different ways to get through this. Your plan focusses on testing more than almost anything else, and more than some of the other plans. Everyone acknowledges that testing is important, but why is it so central to every idea that you’ve put forward?

The key to solving the economic crisis is to reduce the fear that someone will get sick if they go to work or go shop. So it’s really about building confidence. The thing about testing is that it’s easy to explain and it doesn’t frighten people the way digital contact tracing does. It’s not subject to technological and social, political uncertainty the way digital contact tracing is. It doesn’t require the organizational capacity that doing human contact tracing does. It’s really just a very simple, easy-to-explain idea—that to control the pandemic, we need to get a reasonable majority of the people who are infectious into a quarantine, and then we’re good. That’s really all it’s about. So I wanted to try and articulate a very simple approach for managing this crisis, because I think that’s central to restoring confidence.

For example, think about me going back to my dentist. It doesn’t really matter what the law says or the governor says I can do. I don’t want to go back to the dentist’s office in New York City until I know that he can show me a recent negative test, and he doesn’t want me to come into his office until I can show him that I’ve got a recent negative test. So I think it’s easy to explain this idea to people, and I think it’s also easy to convince people that this is something we could do for as long as it takes to manage this pandemic. Suppose it takes more than twenty-four months to get to a vaccine. If it takes more than twenty-four months, I could see going and getting tested before I go to the dentist and the dentist could get tested. Neither of us has a problem with that.

I really think that confidence is so central to investment decisions, to planning, to anticipating the future, that we need something so simple that nobody worries if it’s going to work, nobody worries if we’re going to abandon it because it’s too painful. Everybody just says, “O.K., yep, that’s the plan. We’re going to stick to it.” And then we go.

Some of the other plans that have come out have dealt more with things like contract tracing and digital surveillance. Is your critique of this approach that you yourself are worried about privacy issues, or is it more that you think that politics or that those plans will be concerning to citizens, which will then impair our ability to put them into effect and get the economic growth back where we want?

I’m not worried about the privacy issues, because it’s kind of, like, “Compared to what?” I think we’ve got enormous problems with surveillance right now. This doesn’t seem to me to make it much worse. But I was participating in digital discussions about response to the crisis, and the meeting would go like this: “We need more testing.” Financial people said, “Yep, we got it.” “We need masks and protective equipment.” “Yep, fine.” “And then we need to have the digital contact tracing.” And then, all of a sudden, the whole meeting is taken up with hand-wringing and anxiety and all kinds of fears. Every time somebody said “digital contact tracing,” it became a target. So I just don’t see how you get something done with the kind of speed we need right now when it raises so many concerns among so many people.

Testing has sped up but is still not where it needs to be. Shouldn’t the government be willing to do basically anything, including spending any amount of money, to amp up testing, because the money it spends will be a rounding error in the budget compared to the economy coming back?

I think I share your puzzlement about why that doesn’t just end the discussion. And some people ask, “Well, what do you as an economist have, what’s your business poking into an issue that should be the domain of the epidemiologists?” And my answer is, “Listen, you need the perspective of economics to say that, right now, this depression is costing us, in an order of magnitude, back-of-the-envelope, five hundred billion dollars per month. So, if we can come up with a solution that costs us like eight to ten billion a month, we’re way ahead. And so don’t worry about whether we can afford to do the testing compared to the alternative. We can obviously afford it. Let’s just see if we can agree to testing at that level, then provide the kind of safety we need, and that we can communicate to everybody how this works and why it will work.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/paul-romer-on-how-to-survive-the-chaos-of-the-coronavirus

"['Rachel Syme', 'Rachel Sym', 'Sean Laver', 'Alexandra Schwart']",2020-05-05,“This Is What Happens to Couples Under Stress”: An Interview with Esther Perel,"Relationships are hard, even when we are not in the midst of a global pandemic. Nobody knows this more intimately than the Belgian psychotherapist and author Esther Perel, whose hit podcast, “Where Should We Begin?” allows listeners to play fly on the wall as she conducts actual couples’ therapy sessions. Perel is also the author of the best-selling books “Mating in Captivity,” about sex within monogamous relationships, and “The State of Affairs,” about navigating infidelity. In late March, as countries across the globe were enacting social-distancing measures, she launched a special podcast series called “Couples Under Lockdown.” In the series so far, Perel has done therapy sessions with couples in Italy, Belgium, and New York City, counselling them through the challenges of this very anxious, and often exasperating, time. “If we want to look at the challenges of communication, of sexuality, of desire, of conflict in relationships, this is such a Petri-dish moment,” Perel told me recently over Zoom. During our conversation, which has been edited and condensed, we spoke about how to fight with your partner during quarantine, how to go on dates from home, what to do if your partner’s habits are driving you insane, and how to maintain a sense of self when you can’t escape each other.

I saw your husband just walk through the room. Are you together in the house?

We are together, yes. (laughs)

How’s that going?

You know, right now we are both working, doing psychotherapy. We are in our own professional worlds and then we come together, at different times throughout the day, and have a lot to share. I think what helps a lot is that both of us feel like we’re doing something quite meaningful at the moment, with what we know, what we have practiced. We are physically removed, but we are professionally and psychologically very, very close to what’s going on and, therefore, to each other as well.

I was thinking the other day about one of your first books, “Mating in Captivity.” With what we’re going through now, the captivity has become quite literal.

“Mating in Captivity: The Quarantine Edition.”

You’ve often pointed out that too much is expected of modern relationships: your partner is supposed to be your best friend and your lover and your psychotherapist and your child-care co-worker and, you know, your dishwasher. Everything. And those roles, historically, used to be spread out within communal structures. And it seems like this pandemic has only magnified the degree to which we’re forced to rely on our partners.

I think that, really, what is essential at this moment, especially when we have just one person to give us what an entire village should be providing, is that we create boundaries, routines, and rituals. There needs to be, as best as possible, a separation between daytime and evening, week time and weekend, working time and idle time, family time and individual time, moments that are task oriented and moments where we stop for a bit. When we’re going to eat, are we going to reset the table or just push our work stuff away a little bit so that we have room to put a plate down? I think that, more than ever, the routine that creates a structure, that brings a certain sense of order in a world that feels so chaotic and so unsure, is crucial. The ritual is what separates the ordinary and the mundane from something that becomes more elevated, more separated, more sacred. All of these three things are essential.

Some of my friends have commented that being at home with their partners has made some of the “invisible work” they do, which their partners took for granted, quite visible. For example, they’re, like, “Who did you think cleans the house and does the dishes? Suddenly, you see all that that I’m doing.” Or, vice versa, maybe someone says, “You have finally seen what I do at work. And you see how hard I work. And you’re not acknowledging it.” What effect does that have, to have these things suddenly visible in a new way?

What is happening now, in this expanded view of ourselves and of our partners, can go in two directions. In one direction, you say, “I’m curious. Tell me more. I never knew. I really appreciate it. I realize how clueless I was, how I let you do everything.” And it becomes really a source of connection. In the other version, it becomes a source of blame: “You want me to tell you how much I’ve been doing? I just did the laundry! I just cleaned the sinks! You would just live in a pigsty! What’s the matter with you?” You begin to complain in such a way that insures that the other person is going to try to chew you out as fast as possible, and you’re not going to get the help.

This brings me to the question of how people should fight. Couples are going to get into arguments and log jams during this time. But you literally can’t walk away. I’m wondering how you are seeing couples work through things when they cannot physically separate.

You don’t need to have a door to leave the house. You can be somewhere there without being absolutely present. I think that couples, by definition, go through harmony, disharmony, and repair. This is a dance that we do no matter what. By definition, we fight. What matters is how you fight. When you get really mad at something, can you afterward say, “O.K., got that out of my system—how are we going to solve this?” or “Look, I realize I was quite unfair. Let me first say what I do appreciate about what you do before I dump on you the whole list of stuff that I don’t think you do.” That’s why I play this little exercise of ten yeses and ten nos, which my colleague Dan Siegel taught me. It’s so powerful. Because if you start with the yes, you will fight differently. You will actually have a different argument. You can diffuse it with humor.

Begin by saying to yourself, “What are the one or two things that they have done that I can appreciate?” Otherwise, it’s whatever is negative I will highlight, and whatever is positive I will take for granted. If we made it on time, it’s because there was no traffic, and, if we got there late, it’s because of you. The negative is attributed to the other person, and the positive is just taken as “that’s the way it should be.”

And you can be all entitled about this and say, “Well, there’s no reason I should appreciate that, because I have done a whole bunch of things, and you haven’t appreciated them either.” But the productive thing is to start with you. You want to change the other? You change you.

What else can you say about how to fight better?

Stay focussed on the task. When you want to talk about the dishes, don’t end up talking about five different things, two of which are years old. Don’t “kitchen-sink” it. Keep yourself to the one thing that you’re upset about at this moment.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/this-is-what-happens-to-couples-under-stress-an-interview-with-esther-perel
"['Casey Cep', 'Casey Ce', 'Zoey Pol', 'Susan B. Glasse']",2020-05-02,We Can’t Afford to Lose the Postal Service,"I am probably one of the least consequential things my mother has ever delivered. She has two other daughters, for starters—one’s a public servant and the other is a special-education teacher. But she’s also spent her working life delivering love letters, college acceptances, medications, mortgage papers, divorce filings, gold bars, headstones, ashes, and care packages. In her thirty-eight years as a rural letter carrier with the United States Postal Service, she’s delivered just about everything you can legally send through the mail.

For twenty-seven of those years, she’s driven the same fifty miles five or six days every week, starting out at the post office and tracing Rural Route 5, bringing letters and packages to her five hundred and forty-five customers. Her best advice from all that driving is to carry duct tape, which can fix anything, and can even be made into a leash if you happen to find a lost dog. Her best day, she says, was a few years ago, when a retirement community got added to her route—a hundred and fifty-seven new customers, with stories and the time to tell them. The retirement home comes early in her fifty miles, but some days she stops again on her way home for longer visits, or heads back there on weekends for birthdays and anniversaries or to welcome someone home from the hospital.

My mother is so close with so many of the people who live along her route that they have always felt like second or third cousins to me—people I knew I was related to even if I didn’t see them very often. Mr. R. sent books home with her for me to read; the E. family pulled her jeep out of a snow drift and towed her back to the post office when her brakes failed; the F. family lost two children when their house burned down; Mrs. M. baked her bread and gave her iced tea in a to-go cup; the B. family had some landscaping work they wanted my father to do—and on and on through the years, a litany of routine or unexpected celebrations and tragedies and kindnesses. In the course of almost four decades, my mother has watched babies she saw come home from the hospital grow into adults who mail their parents Christmas letters with photographs of their own children, wondered whether a husband or wife or neither will stay in their house after a marriage ended, and seen grandchildren take over wheat farms from their grandparents.

Being a rural letter carrier suits my mother, and it enabled her to provide for a family like ours: it is a union job, with protections and benefits, insurance and vacation days, only modest raises but occasional overtime and reliable, transparent wages. It isn’t all wonderful; I was an adult before I noticed that the official vehicles she and her fellow-carriers drive do not have air-conditioning, and that her joints are already arthritic, her knees busted, her shoulders and back chronically sore, her gait wobbled by the wear and tear caused by hefting fifty-pound packages of dog food and forty-pound boxes of cat litter that are supposedly cheaper on Amazon than they are at the local store. Still, it is a better job than she thought she would ever have, and it allowed her to keep us in braces, allergy shots, X-rays, books, clothes, and movies. Eventually, it got her credit good enough to get us savings accounts and credit cards and loans.

My father, who is older and had been working longer than my mother had, was a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers; my mother joined the National Rural Letter Carriers’ union as soon as she was eligible. They knew that whatever they hoped for their children, they themselves would always be labor, not management. So we were a union family: my parents spent a few nights a year at local meetings, and if we went on vacation it was to wherever the annual union convention was held that year—usually the beach near where we lived, in Maryland, although one year we drove all the way to Maine. While we three watched the miracle that was cable television or played mini-golf with Dad, my mother put on her Sunday best and spent her days doing what I later learned a lot of other people’s parents did all the time: attend meetings. To me, my mother suddenly seemed like an executive.

Unions are the most powerful advocate people like my parents have. That power is one of the reasons that, although the U.S.P.S. is by far the most popular government agency, it is the one most often threatened with extinction. My mother is about to retire, and I worry that the agency she has spent her life serving will be retired soon, too. The coronavirus, which has decimated the global economy, has not spared the Postal Service—and while shipping and package volume are on the rise, standard and bulk mail have plummeted, leaving the U.S.P.S. with increasing deficits. But if the coronavirus kills the Postal Service, its death will have been hastened, as so many deaths are right now, by an underlying condition: for the past forty years, Republicans have been seeking to starve, strangle, and sabotage it, hoping to privatize one of the oldest and most important public goods in American history.

Before they declared their independence, the American colonists decided that they needed a better way to communicate with one another. In the summer of 1775, at the Second Continental Congress, they created the Postal Service and named Benjamin Franklin its first Postmaster General. Where before letters or packages had to be carried between inns and taverns or directly from house to house, now there was a way for Americans to safely, discreetly, and reliably correspond across long distances. After the Revolution, when Congress ratified the Articles of Confederation, legislators included the Post Office in the ninth of those articles, and later enshrined it in the first article of the Constitution.

The Founders saw the Postal Service as an essential vehicle for other rights, especially the freedom of the press: one of the first postal laws set a special discounted rate for newspapers. But they also understood that a national post unifies a nation, allowing its citizens to stay connected and connecting them with their federal government. When Alexis de Tocqueville toured the young country several decades after its founding, he travelled partly by mail coach, noting in “Democracy in America” how “the mail, that great link between minds, today penetrates into the heart of the wilderness.”

But the mail didn’t just follow American settlers into the wilderness—it also led to the transformation of the frontier. The constitutional authority that created the Postal Service allowed for the construction of post roads to link faraway cities; eventually, these ran all the way from Florida to Maine. A few of those essential byways survive, some of them obvious in their names, like the Old Albany Post Road and the Boston Post Road. Later, that authority was interpreted more broadly to justify federal investment in railroads and highways. During its long history, the Postal Service has delivered the mail by pony express, mule train, float planes, ferry boats, motorcycles, skis, hovercrafts, and pneumatic tubes. There were only seventy-five post offices at the nation’s founding, but by the time the Civil War started there were more than twenty-eight thousand spread around the country.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/we-cant-afford-to-lose-the-postal-service
"['Evan Osnos', 'Evan Osno', 'Jane Maye', 'George Saunder']",2020-05-05,How Greenwich Republicans Learned to Love Trump,"How did America’s country-club Republicans, the cultural descendants of Prescott Bush, learn to love Donald Trump? They don’t have much in common with the clichéd image of his admirers: anxious about losing status to minorities, resentful of imperious élites, and marooned in places where life expectancy has fallen. But the full picture has never been that simple. As early as May, 2016, exit polls and other data showed that Trump supporters earned an average of seventy-two thousand dollars a year, while supporters of Hillary Clinton earned eleven thousand dollars less. Two-thirds of Trump’s supporters had incomes higher than the national median—sometimes, as in Greenwich, much higher.

Shopping Cartoon by Roz Chast

I grew up in Greenwich, on Round Hill Road, not far from the club where Prescott Bush stormed out of the locker room. My great-grandparents Albert and Linda Sherer moved to town from Chicago in 1937. Albert was a Republican who worked in advertising for the National Biscuit Company, and Linda raised their two children. They were renters until 1968, when they bought a white Colonial with a wide lawn. The house passed down through the generations, and, when I was nine years old, my parents moved the family from Brooklyn to Greenwich, into a world of uncountable advantages. In 1994, I graduated from Greenwich High School, which is the rare public school that has a championship water-polo team and an electron microscope. (It was a donation, obtained by an award-winning science teacher.)

People around town have never much cared for caricatures of the place—the starchy patricians, the chinless wonders, the history of exclusion—even when there is truth in them. For decades, many African-Americans and Jews were prevented from buying homes. In 1975, protesters came to town with signs reading “Cocktail bigots” and “Share the summer,” because Greenwich barred nonresidents from a public beach—a restriction that lasted until the state Supreme Court overturned it, in 2001. Nobody pretends that bigotry has vanished, but these days the town has more diversity than outsiders expect. Thirty-eight per cent of its public-school students are minorities, mostly Latino; in some elementary schools, at least half the students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Many of their parents work in local service jobs, bearing high rents and expenses in order to access some of the country’s best public schools. Frank Farricker, a real-estate developer and a Democratic activist, said, “I tell everybody that Greenwich only discriminates on the basis of one color: green.”

The seacoast of Fairfield County has always been one of America’s most affluent places, but in recent decades it has sprinted ahead of the rest of the country. In 2016, according to federal estimates, it was the wealthiest metropolitan area in the United States, outstripping the oil country of Midland, Texas, and the technology hub of San Francisco. Even though a string of tycoons have fled Connecticut in search of lower taxes, the latest Forbes ranking of the world’s billionaires lists fifteen of them in the “Greater Greenwich Area,” led by Ray Dalio, the founder of the hedge fund Bridgewater, who is worth an estimated eighteen billion dollars.

From afar, it is easy to misread the politics of the place: like much of America’s coasts, the Gold Coast has swung left, culturally and politically, since the days of Prescott Bush. The largest share of voters in Greenwich today are unaffiliated; Republicans still hold an edge over Democrats, but the margin is less than four thousand registered voters. In 2016, nobody was surprised that Clinton beat Trump in Greenwich, fifty-seven per cent to thirty-nine. But that portrait—of liberal cosmopolitans appalled by Trump—obscures a potent element of American politics: the executive class of the Republican Party. Its members are wealthier, more conservative, and more politically active than their forebears, in ways that have helped Trump reach the White House, survive impeachment, and fortify his bid for reëlection during the anguish of the coronavirus pandemic. Understanding how he retains the overwhelming support of Republicans requires an accounting of not only what he promised Americans at the bottom but also what he provides Americans at the top.

The story of Trump’s rise is often told as a hostile takeover. In truth, it is something closer to a joint venture, in which members of America’s élite accepted the terms of Trumpism as the price of power. Long before anyone imagined that Trump might become President, a generation of unwitting patrons paved the way for him. From Greenwich and places like it, they launched a set of financial, philanthropic, and political projects that have changed American ideas about government, taxes, and the legitimacy of the liberal state.

The former congressman Christopher Shays is a moderate Republican who was elected eleven times to represent the Gold Coast, from 1987 to 2009. Now conservatives mock him as a RINO—a Republican in name only. “When Sean Hannity calls someone like me a RINO, I want to punch him in the nose,” Shays told me. “I got elected as a Republican for thirty-four effing years, and Hannity has never gotten elected for anything.” When Shays talks to former staff and constituents in Connecticut, he has come to recognize the delicate language of accommodation: “I was talking to a guy I know well, after some pathetic thing that Trump did, and his response was ‘Yes, but he’s selecting the right Supreme Court Justices.’ I started to laugh at him, because I know for a fact that’s a minor issue for him.” Shays believes that many Americans quietly share Trump’s desire to reduce immigration and cut social-welfare programs for the poor. “He’s saying what people think, and they appreciate that,” Shays said. “But not many are going to admit that’s why they support him.”

When it comes to the essential question—will Trump get reëlected?—the answer rests heavily on a persistent mystery: how many Americans plan to vote for him but wouldn’t say so to a pollster? In Greenwich, Edward Dadakis, a corporate insurance broker who has been involved with Republican politics for fifty years, told me that many of his friends are “below the radar screen.” He went on, “In a sense, I’m one of them. I’m out there in the public domain, so people know where I stand, but in 2016, for the first election ever, I did not put a bumper sticker on my car.” He worries how strangers will react. He said, “I still have two ‘Make America Great Again’ hats at home, wrapped in plastic.”

The southern panhandle of Connecticut is cradled between the gray-blue waters of Long Island Sound and the wooded border of New York State. In politics and in culture, it’s a mashup of New England and New York, a place settled by Puritans who agonized over what the historian Missy Wolfe calls “the proper balance between their flock’s economic success and the level of success that they deemed would offend God.” Long after the Puritans were gone, the tension remained in a seesawing battle between the Brahmin and the buccaneer, service and profit, restraint and greed. For much of the twentieth century, the Brahmin had the advantage.

In 1927, Owen D. Young, a Greenwich resident who was the first chairman of General Electric, gave a speech at Harvard Business School, in which he scolded businessmen who “devise ways and means to squeeze out of labor its last ounce of effort and last penny of compensation.” He encouraged them instead to “think in terms of human beings—one group of human beings who put their capital in, and another group who put their lives and labor in a common enterprise for mutual advantage.” Rick Wartzman, a longtime head of the Drucker Institute and a historian of corporate behavior, told me, “This really was beyond rhetoric. We were much more of a ‘we’ culture than an ‘I’ culture.” On Young’s watch, G.E. became one of the first American companies to give workers a pension, profit-sharing, life insurance, medical coverage, loans, and housing assistance.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/how-greenwich-republicans-learned-to-love-trump
"['Helen Rosner', 'Helen Rosne']",2020-03-26,"Helen, Help Me: Is a Ramp Grown on My Windowsill Still a Ramp?","If you have quarantine-cooking questions for Helen, send them to themail@newyorker.com with the subject line “Helen, Help Me.”

My wife, we just discovered, is pregnant. Meanwhile, there are five pounds of rib-eye steaks in our freezer. With searing to medium rare no longer an option, I am thoroughly confused. I thought perhaps sous vide, but don’t know what temperature or timing would qualify as safe. I entertained some sort of braise, but it feels like a waste of prime beef. What should I do? —Luke M., Queens, New York

I revere a gorgeously marbled rib-eye as much as the next ethically conflicted carnivore, but I do sometimes marvel at how the American predilection for steak—i.e., a big, honkin’ slab of beef—has blinded us to all the other ways those same edible parts of the cow can be put to use. Thaw your rib eye almost all the way (or, if it’s not currently frozen, pop it in the freezer for about twenty minutes) and use a very sharp knife to slice it thinly across the grain—there, you’ve got the backbone of a gorgeous stir-fry. Or shave it even more thinly (take your time, with both the knife sharpening and the meat shaving) and make yourself some sweet-spicy Korean bulgogi, or a Chicago-style Italian beef sandwich, a Sichuan hot pot, a Philly cheesesteak, or tacos enchilados, where thinly sliced meat (usually pork, but, hey, use beef!) is marinated in a spicy paste of chiles and herbs and then seared in a hot pan to a state of crispy, meaty, fiery euphoria, and served atop warm tortillas—a perfect meal to celebrate your impending parenthood!

Can you regrow ramps from their bulbs like you can with scallions and leeks? Technically, if a ramp is a wild leek, and what I’m growing is cultivated and no longer wild, is it still a ramp? —Annmarie P., Brooklyn, New York

From a practical perspective, yes, you can plop the bulb end of a ramp in a glass of water and it will re-sprout, at least a little bit. I have a few cut ramps regrowing right now, lined up next to my stoutly regrowing scallions and some re-shooting green garlic in my windowsill victory garden. As for the second part of your question, which is one of category, I’ll brush the dust off my inner Bertrand Russell and tackle this like the proper logic puzzle it is. Let’s start off with some premises:

R (ramps exist)

R → V (if something is a ramp, it’s a vegetable)

V → (W ⩒ C) (all vegetables are either wild or cultivated, but not both)

R → W (if it’s a ramp, it must be wild)

We can thus interstitially conclude that:

C → ~R (if a vegetable is cultivated, it’s not a ramp)

But we can also take somewhat axiomatically the following:

G (you’re growing vegetables in a cup of water set in your kitchen window)

G → C (if a vegetable is grown in a cup of water set in your kitchen window, it’s cultivated)

And, of course:

V ⊃ ~S (if something is a vegetable, it will not spontaneously transform into a different kind of vegetable upon being regrown in a cup of water set in your kitchen window)

Q.E.D.: G → ~R; whatever you’re growing isn’t ramps.

This is either a bold proof of the fact that ramps are not ramps, or else compelling evidence that, at least in matters culinary, certain applications of mathematical logic are largely useless. If you happen to have any liquid plant food lying around, try adding a drop to the cup of water, both to speed growth and to add a little robustness to the flavor of your ramps, or zombie ramps, or non-ramps, or whatever the hell they are.

I live in Lisbon, Portugal. Around this time every year, passionfruit descends into our frutarias from far-flung nooks of the Lusophone world. The first time I cut into a passionfruit—and inhaled it—was exactly four years ago, on the seaside road of Timor-Leste’s capital, Dili. Every year since, I would buy one, slice it open over the quiet of my kitchen sink, and take it in straight from the shell: the oyster of fruit. I’ve now gone back to my Bulgarian roots, worshipping at the altar of my pantry for survival, each ingredient picked because it can present a seemingly infinite number of possibilities. Passionfruit, consumed thousands of miles away from its native land, is suddenly revealed as a single-use delight, unfit for a time of mass hunger; a metaphor for the rot at the core of our global food system. So, I humbly ask, what should one do with this year’s crop—nay, what should we think of it? Eat it because it’s here, freeze it for better days, or reject it as I hope we reject our destructive ways? —Petya K., Lisbon

This is the great ethical question of all consumption, isn’t it? On one hand, what’s done is done—the passionfruit has already been shipped across the world, the cow has already been slaughtered, the thousand-year-old sequoia has already been chopped down. On the other hand, what’s done begets more doing. If we let the passionfruit go uneaten, in protest of the harm it causes, will the harm have all been imposed for nothing? If we consume it, to temper that harm with a dose of pleasure, are we simply creating more demand—more future harm? There’s no single answer; it varies by scope, by place, by person, by need, by thing. Some measure of destruction is inevitable: we should strive to tread lightly in our lives, but it’s impossible not to tread at all. Still, that’s no excuse for recklessness. One passionfruit is a time machine of memory, ten are a fruit-bowl frivolity, a thousand might be a bloodstain. It’s right there in the poem that is your question: make decisions that feel important, enact them at a scale that feels meaningful, and try to slurp from them every golden drop. If you do have room in your freezer for a few passionfruit, you might as well save one or two for later.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/kitchen-notes/helen-help-me-is-a-ramp-grown-on-my-windowsill-still-a-ramp
"['David Quammen', 'David Quamme', 'Karl Taro Greenfel', 'Carolyn Korman']",2020-05-05,Why Weren’t We Ready for the Coronavirus?,"In 2006, the idea that an unknown virus might spill out of some wild animal into humans, achieving person-to-person transmission and causing a global pandemic, seemed a distant prospect to most people. As an engaging science-fiction scare, it ranked somewhere beneath “Alien: Resurrection.” But Ali S. Khan, of the National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases, was tasked with dreaming that nightmare by daylight.

NCZVED (pronounced “N. C. Zved,” according to Khan), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resided in an unobtrusive gray brick building, behind locked gates and locked doors in the C.D.C.’s compound on Clifton Road, six miles northeast of downtown Atlanta. During a two-day visit that year, I worked my way along the NCZVED corridors, interviewing scientists who knew all about Ebola viruses (yes, there are more than one) and their lethal cousin Marburg; about West Nile virus in the Bronx and Sin Nombre virus in Arizona; about simian foamy virus in Bali, which is carried by temple monkeys that crawl over tourists, and monkeypox, which reached Illinois in giant Gambian rats sold as pets; about Junin virus in Argentina and Machupo virus in Bolivia; about Lassa virus in West Africa, Nipah virus in Malaysia, Hendra virus in Australia, and rabies everywhere. All these viruses are zoonotic, meaning that they can pass from animals to people. Most of them, once in a human body, cause mayhem. Some of them also transmit well among people, bursting into local outbreaks that may kill hundreds. They are new to science and to human immune systems; they emerge unpredictably and are difficult to treat; and they can be especially dangerous, as reflected in the name of the branch within NCZVED that studied them—Special Pathogens. For these reasons, some scientists and public-health experts, including Ali Khan, find the viruses an irresistible challenge. “It’s because they keep you on your toes,” he told me. On the second day of my visit, amid the intriguingly gruesome briefings, Khan took me out for sushi.

Khan is a medical doctor by training, an epidemiologist by career, and a man of candid, irreverent jocularity. He was wearing an epauletted uniform sweater; at the time, he was also an officer in the United States Public Health Service, which is organized into ranks, like those in the U.S. Navy. “You’ve heard all the talk from our people,” he said. “Which of these diseases is your favorite?”

My favorite? Ebola is pretty damn interesting, I told him.

“Aaah,” Khan said dismissively. “I like Ebola as much as the next person.” He had done crucial epidemiological work during the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, in what was then Zaire, organizing control measures, investigating transmission, tracing the outbreak back to its Patient Zero, risking his life to help end a juggernaut of misery and death. He continued, “But, for my money, SARS was the one.”

SARS? I knew of it only as a bad viral disease that, in 2003, came out of southern China and killed people in Toronto, Singapore, and a few other cities. The acronym stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome.” It’s an ugly illness that can lead to lethal pneumonia. A little more than eight thousand people were infected, of whom about ten per cent died, and then the outbreak ended. “Why SARS?” I asked.

“Because it was so contagious, and so lethal,” he said. “And we were very lucky to stop it.” SARS was the bullet that went whistling past humanity’s ear. This was on our lunch break, I had stopped taking notes, and it was fourteen years ago, so I can’t swear that Khan mentioned the other thing that is most relevant about SARS: It was caused by a novel coronavirus.

Ali Khan is now the dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in Omaha. He seems an unlikely Omahan: born and raised in Brooklyn, by Pakistani immigrant parents, he went to Brooklyn College, followed by SUNY Downstate (in Brooklyn) for medical school. “And then I did this crazy thing of leaving Brooklyn”—crazy to his family, “because I have uncles and aunts who have never yet left Brooklyn to go to the city.” His father, Gulab Deen Khan, was a self-made man of the epic sort: as a teen-age peasant farmer, he trekked from Kashmir to Bombay, lied about his age, and got work on a ship, greasing engines. His friends called him Dini, as a diminutive, because he was small. After moving to the U.S., Dini Khan stoked coal in boilers to heat apartment buildings in Brooklyn until he had saved enough to buy an apartment building himself. He made money—what seemed a fortune. Before he lost it, in another speculation, Dini Khan decided that his young son, Ali, should learn about his family’s culture, religion, and language. He sent Ali back to Pakistan for middle and high school. By parental miscalculation, he chose a classic British boarding school in Lahore, a better place to learn cricket than Urdu or Islam. Ali Khan, now fifty-six years old, told me this story, punctuated with laughs, when I reached him recently by Skype. His dark hair and beard had grayed a bit, but he still looked fit and sounded jovial. He spoke of Omaha like a pitchman for the Chamber of Commerce: great city, safe, unpretentious ethos, full of billionaires, such as Warren Buffett, who live in their old family homes, drive their little Buicks, and write million-dollar checks to the community.

“I love being a dean,” he said. “It’s so much fun.” He went to Omaha in 2014, leaving the directorship of the C.D.C.’s Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, which included overseeing the Strategic National Stockpile of emergency medical supplies, supervising eight hundred employees, helping assemble a national biodefense strategy against pandemic threats, and much else. “The end of my career at C.D.C., I managed a $1.5-billion budget, so it was people and money.” He had travelled the world on outbreak responses, from Wyoming to Bangladesh. During a mission to southern Chile, investigating a hantavirus outbreak, he visited remote villages, sometimes on horseback, trapping rodents to determine which species carried the virus. “We learned quickly that there were a lot of rodents,” he said. After he worked on Rift Valley fever in Saudi Arabia, in 2001, the Saudi Minister of Health gave him a Lucite replica of a beheading sword as a token of gratitude. At one dicey moment in central Zaire, during an outbreak of monkeypox, he and his team got word that two sets of combatants in the raging civil war—Laurent Kabila’s guerrillas and the opposing forces of President Mobutu—were coming. “They’ll likely take your vehicles and gear,” an American Embassy contact advised by satellite telephone. “But they probably won’t kill you.” Khan’s group packed fast and vamoosed on a small airplane, which rose straight into a thrashing thunderstorm. “The guy on my left was praying,” Khan recounted in a book, “The Next Pandemic,” full of colorful field adventures and serious warnings, published in 2016. “I looked over and saw that the French physician sitting next to me was writing a farewell note to his family. Which got me thinking.” His thought: This is a risky profession, and the work has to be worth a person’s life. For more than two decades at the C.D.C., it evidently was. In 1995, he did that hitch in Kikwit, Zaire, for Ebola. The following year, he went to the Sultanate of Oman to help with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Uganda, in 2001, for Ebola again. SARS, in Singapore, in 2003.

"['Louisa Thomas', 'Louisa Thoma']",2020-05-05,The U.S. Soccer Team Is Still Fighting for Equal Treatment,"The United States Women’s National Soccer Team had not lost in so long that you could be forgiven for forgetting that they could. They have won the last two World Cups, and four of the eight Women’s World Cups ever played. During their most recent World Cup run, they never trailed; even when the score was tight, the outcome did not seem in doubt—such was their skill and their collective determination. At some point in the past decade—perhaps during the 2015 World Cup final, when Carli Lloyd hammered the ball from midfield over the Japanese goalkeeper’s head and into the net, and certainly by the time Megan Rapinoe stood with her arms outstretched, the goddess of victory, after scoring a goal against France, four years later—winning seemed to become an integral, irrevocable aspect of who they were. “We are such a proud and strong and defiant group of women,” Rapinoe said after the team’s World Cup championship last year. “We’ve done exactly what we’ve set out to do, what we wanted to do. Getting to play at the highest level at the World Cup is ridiculous, but, to be able to couple that with everything off the field, and to back up all of those words with performances and back up those performances with words—it’s just incredible. I feel like this team is in the midst of changing the world around us.”

If the team had a rival, it was not on the field, where no one could touch them. It was with their own federation, U.S. Soccer, which for years had underpaid and undervalued them, the women believed. A year ago, just months before the start of the World Cup, the women filed a gender-discrimination suit against U.S. Soccer, alleging that the federation paid them less and treated them worse than the men’s national team—even though the women were, by many metrics, more popular, and by any measure more successful. The federation countered by noting that the women were paid under a different structure than the men, according to the rules of a collective-bargaining agreement that the women had agreed to—and also that, during the past five years, the women have been paid more, in aggregate and on average, than the men. The women countered by pointing out that they had played more and succeeded more, which earned them bonuses: while the women were winning two World Cups, the men failed to qualify for theirs entirely.

When the U.S. women’s team clinched the championship in Lyon, France, in front of sixty thousand people, the crowd erupted in chants of “Equal pay! Equal pay!” An estimated two hundred and sixty million people were watching the match on television. At a ticker-tape parade in New York, a few days later, the same cheer resounded. The team’s sponsors ran commercials extolling not only the players but their cause. Presidential candidates praised them. The players were more than a team, it appeared; they were a movement, and the movement seemed inexorable.

The federation fought back. On March 9th, about a year after the players filed their suit, lawyers for U.S. Soccer argued in legal filings that the pay disparity between the men and the women was justified by the women’s relative lack of athleticism. “Indisputable science” proved that the women were inferior to the men, the argument ran. The lawyers insisted that the job of a men’s-national-team player “carries more responsibility within U.S. Soccer than the job of [a women’s-national-team] player,” and that being a member of the men’s team “requires a higher level of skill based on speed and strength.”

Two days later, the U.S. women’s team played Japan, in the final of the SheBelieves Cup. The women emerged onto the field with their training shirts inside out, hiding the U.S. Soccer shield, but leaving visible the four stars representing four World Cup titles. Seven minutes into the game, Rapinoe coolly scored off a free kick, on a laser-like shot just under the crossbar. Twenty minutes after that, Christen Press spun around the ball at the top of the penalty area, and, in the same motion, lofted a shot that floated high over the keeper’s head, dropping delicately into the left corner of the goal. In the eighty-third minute came a dagger from Lindsey Horan. The U.S. women won, 3–1, extending their unbeaten streak to thirty-one consecutive games.

After the game, Rapinoe spoke about the arguments that U.S. Soccer had made days before, in court. “To see that blatant misogyny and sexism as the argument used against us is really disappointing,” she said. Sponsors of U.S. Soccer, including Coca-Cola, Volkswagen, Budweiser, Visa, and Deloitte, had all blasted the federation. The men’s team, who were in the midst of renegotiating their own collective-bargaining agreement, had already made a lengthy statement in support of the women. (“In our estimation, the women were due at least triple what our expired deal was worth in player compensation,” it read. “We believe the Federation should have agreed to a deal directly tied to a fair share of the revenue players generate.”) Carlos Cordeiro, the president of U.S. Soccer, apologized, pleaded ignorance, and announced that new lawyers would be hired. Soon after that, he resigned.

Then the sports world came to a halt. The players, like most people, went home and stayed there. The trial, originally set for May 5th, was pushed back. As life changed in previously unimaginable ways, the women were left waiting to make history. And then, on Friday, May 1st, federal Judge R. Gary Klausner, ruling in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Pasadena, rejected the plaintiffs’ argument and sided with U.S. Soccer, which had insisted that the women’s claim of unequal pay due to gender discrimination should be dismissed. (He allowed a more narrow claim of unequal treatment, related to travel, training, and medical staff, to go forward; the trial is scheduled to begin June 16th.) The truly unthinkable had happened: the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team lost.

Whatever the public might have believed, winning the lawsuit was never a sure thing. If the men’s team had simply qualified for their World Cup, they would have earned more than the women during the past five years. But they didn’t, and so the women have in fact made more money than the men. It is also true that the men and women negotiated substantially different collective-bargaining agreements: the men, under theirs, were paid for individual performances, in a pay-for-play model. The women had rejected a similar structure, opting instead for more security, with negotiated salaries, maternity and child-care benefits, and severance pay for when players were cut. The court found that the women could not retroactively object to having agreed to an inferior arrangement.

Of course, the women did not agree to lower bonuses in favor of more security because they believed it was sure to pay them more but because they didn’t have much of a choice. Men’s professional soccer is the world’s most popular sport; many of the players on the U.S. men’s team make hundreds of thousands, and even millions, playing for their club teams. They could afford the riskier pay structure for the national team. When the women were negotiating their agreement, the very future of women’s professional soccer seemed fragile; for some players in the National Women’s Soccer League, pay was low enough that they worked second jobs. They needed insurance because they weren’t sure to get it elsewhere.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/the-us-soccer-team-is-still-fighting-for-equal-treatment

"['Vinson Cunningham', 'Vinson Cunningha', 'Hilton Al']",2020-05-05,Lorraine Hansberry’s Roving Global Vision,"Since early April, when the great literary critic and English professor Cheryl A. Wall died, I have been thinking about the last book she published, “On Freedom and the Will to Adorn,” about the African-American essay tradition. Wall was one of the foremost scholars and interpreters of the work of Zora Neale Hurston, and, in “On Freedom,” Wall latches on to Hurston’s assertion that the “will to adorn”—a tendency toward linguistic flourish, even under duress—is an important aspect of “Negro expression.” Wall believed that the black essay has often fulfilled two barely extricable purposes: to argue for political, economic, social, racial, and sexual liberation, and to satisfy a writer’s urge for self-expression through aesthetics.

Wall’s insight goes beyond the essay; it’s more like an unveiling of the impulses—sometimes harmonious, sometimes dissonant—that come together to make art of any kind that is anchored in place and time but can also move past those parameters. There may be no better example of this capacity in the modern American theatre than the life and art of the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, who died in 1965, at the age of thirty-four, but left behind enough genius for lovers of literature to follow like a trail of generous crumbs. (May 19th will mark the ninetieth anniversary of Hansberry’s birth.)

Even before her sparkling career as a playwright began, Hansberry walked a political-artistic tightrope, making personal and creative adjustments in order to achieve the kind of balance that Wall describes. In her early twenties, having just arrived in New York from the Midwest, she published poems in radical journals; worked as a journalist for Freedom, a black leftist newspaper published by the actor and singer Paul Robeson; and studied with W. E. B. Du Bois, at the Jefferson School of Social Science. She was beginning to hone her lifelong leftward politics into a roving, endlessly empathetic global vision.

Around that time—according to “Looking for Lorraine: The Radiant and Radical Life of Lorraine Hansberry,” Imani Perry’s intimate, ruminative book, from 2018, more documentary portrait than strict biography—Hansberry sent a letter to her boyfriend, Robert Nemiroff, whom she would later marry. The letter ended with a tellingly determined manifesto:

1. I am a writer. I am going to write.

2. I am going to become a writer.

3. Any real contribution I can make to the movement can only be the result of a disciplined life. I am going to institute discipline in my life.

4. I can paint. I am going to paint.

The END

Hansberry was not only personally ambitious but also hoped to merge her aesthetic and political concerns, which had grown together like a tree with twin trunks—its highest branches intermingled, its sustenance coursing through a mutual system of roots.

Perry’s book is an elegant, softly subjective rereading of the facts of Hansberry’s life. If Hansberry’s own story is a kind of drama, Perry is her most perceptive, unabashedly biased critic, helping to reiterate and build on her themes, and to make her performance live again. “Looking for Lorraine” tunnels deep into Hansberry’s psyche, showing how the dissonance of her youth yielded a poised artist, cut down too early by illness. Hansberry had a relatively bourgeois, liberal, middle-class upbringing, in Chicago, but it was ringed by violence. When her father, a real-estate entrepreneur, bought a house in a white neighborhood, the family was greeted with a cement block thrown through their front window; it just missed Lorraine’s head, and lodged itself into a wall.

If Perry has one persistent obsession, it is how, after this harrowing moment, Hansberry struggled to synthesize her attraction to politics, her deeply felt humanism, and her native interest in beauty: how she learned to move from helpless frustration to a contemplation of the earth’s magnificence in one mental stroke. “There were her politics, centered on the poor, the marginal, the oppressed and outsiders,” Perry writes, “and there was her grasping at the interior life.”

In 1959, Hansberry had an astounding success, with “A Raisin in the Sun,” becoming the first black woman to have a play début on Broadway. The plot centers on a Chicago family’s complications in moving to an all-white neighborhood. It satisfied every requirement of a “well made” domestic drama, setting its characters’ generational, religious, and political divisions so artfully against one another that the eventual climax—Walter Younger’s loss of his family inheritance—feels like a glimpse beyond setting and character and into the country’s future of commingled hopes and desires.

After “Raisin” ’s run, Hansberry wrote a post-apocalyptic fantasy called “What Use Are Flowers?” She conceived it as a television special, but decided to make it a play instead. Parts of it have been adapted for radio and staged readings, and some of its text was used in “To Be Young, Gifted and Black,” the posthumous play that was edited by Nemiroff. To read “Flowers” now—alongside other post-“Raisin” works, such as “Les Blancs” and “The Drinking Gourd,” all of which, along with “Flowers,” are collected in a book called “Les Blancs: The Collected Last Plays of Lorraine Hansberry,” from 1972—is to be reminded that, for Hansberry, “Raisin” was a beginning, not an end. The theatre, with its urge to make the interior visible, and to force contradictions through the refiner’s fire of confrontation, was a perfect vehicle for her to develop both her politics and her art.

“Flowers” begins in a bleak landscape, empty except for a group of scantily clothed kids. They are prelingual, and look hungry. It’s unclear what has happened to civilization, but the clear reference—given the time, and Hansberry’s global political concerns—is to the bomb. Hansberry had watched Du Bois, her mentor and a family friend, get arrested and indicted after starting a petition against nuclear weapons. He was ostracized in polite circles, both black and white, and was labelled a Soviet agent.

Hansberry’s admiration for Du Bois was total. In a journal entry, she called him “freedom’s passion, refined and organized.” That formulation sounds like an eerie anticipation of Wall’s: Du Bois’s 1903 book, “The Souls of Black Folk,” in which he brought together social science, reportage, music criticism, and even fiction, is a cornerstone of the black essay tradition. He had used his peerless education, personal fastidiousness, and artistic flair as a conduit for his passions, not an excuse to dampen them in the name of respectability. He had paved a road that Hansberry hoped to travel.

In “Flowers,” the kids kill an animal and fight over the body. Nobody coöperates; it’s a microcosm of Hobbes’s “war of all against all.” A struggle ensues, and, Hansberry notes in her stage directions, “those who are strongest triumph.” Apocalypse has exposed human ruthlessness and set it loose as the highest law.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/lorraine-hansberrys-roving-global-vision
"['Amy Davidson Sorkin', 'Amy Davidson Sorki', 'Sheelah Kolhatka', 'Charles Bethe']",2020-05-05,The Rush to Reopen,"Illustration by João Fazenda

The fatal confusion of the United States’ response to the coronavirus crisis is now moving to a more disjointed stage: the rush to reopen. Last week, as statewide stay-at-home orders began to expire, governors from Alabama to Missouri softened or declined to extend them. The new measures are a hodgepodge: Texas is allowing movie theatres to reopen, with some limits, but not gyms. Georgia allows both—and massage and tattoo parlors. Some of the steps seem influenced less by epidemiology than by industry lobbies and excessive attention paid to scattered protests. (Polls show that most Americans support closures.) The Attorney General, William Barr, has told prosecutors to look for and take action against “overbearing” restrictions. President Trump, who has left reopening decisions to the states, offering only loose guidelines, does not seem especially worried that moving too quickly might lead to more waves of death from COVID-19. “If there’s a fire, we’re going to put it out,” he said, on Wednesday. The danger is that reopening will become an act of mass arson.

A key point of closures and social distancing was to slow the spread—to flatten the curve—so that the first wave of the pandemic would not overwhelm the health-care system. Those actions bought time to prepare hospitals, develop treatments, and get closer to a vaccine. Perhaps above all, time was needed to make widespread testing available, and to follow it up with contact tracing. As much as President Trump has claimed otherwise, that effort has hardly begun. Texas has tested only about one per cent of its population, and cases are not yet declining there in a sustained way. In Indiana and Minnesota, which are pushing to reopen, cases are rising. Even New York, which is testing more people than many countries, doesn’t seem to have the tests it needs to provide an accurate death toll. More than five thousand presumed COVID victims in New York City have been excluded from the state tally because they were never tested, complicating attempts to assess the disease’s trajectory.

Still, given the heavy social burdens of the closures, some states are drawing up more cautious, calibrated plans. Governor Andrew Cuomo, of New York, has said that he intends to allow hospitals in some upstate counties, which have been less hard hit, to resume performing elective procedures—a category that includes many cancer surgeries. He also has committed New York to work in concert with six other Northeastern states, so that they do not end up undercutting one another’s efforts. California, Oregon, and Washington have formed a similar partnership. Reopening is, in fact, a matter not of relaxation but of vigilance. Governor Gavin Newsom, of California, has begun talking about opening schools in July, to make up for lost days, but he also closed the state’s beaches, after crowds of people flocked to them.

Some who argue for reopening sooner rather than later say that doing so will allow for a “controlled spread” of the disease, in which more people can develop a resistance and the population as a whole can achieve “herd immunity.” One problem with this approach is the projected number of hospitalizations and deaths along the way, which is very high. Another is that the idea assumes that those who have had COVID-19 will, indeed, be immune. But, as the World Health Organization recently warned, it isn’t yet clear how effective or enduring any immunity might be. There are viruses, such as measles, for which the immunity is lifelong; for SARS and MERS, which are coronaviruses, immunity seems to fade, on average, in a couple of years. For the four other known human coronaviruses, which cause varieties of the common cold, immunity lasts just months.

Meanwhile, the F.D.A. has allowed companies to market a grab bag of serological tests, meant to detect a prior infection, even though they tend to give high rates of false positives, possibly mistaking antibodies that a person has acquired from fighting off a cold for the remnants of a battle with COVID-19. That is a shaky basis on which, say, to send a health worker back into a nursing home. Without coherent, stringent standards, the field of serological testing will remain in a hazardous state, threatening a cruel replay of the disastrous problems with diagnostic testing.

The discussion around reopening often draws a distinction between “the vulnerable” and everybody else, as if our strength were not defined by our willingness to stand together. Reading Texas’s reopening plan, one would think that only the elderly are vulnerable. Yet one of the risk factors for death from COVID-19 is obesity, which affects a third of the adults in the South and the Midwest. And diabetes is a major factor in the many deaths of people who are relatively young. There is a misperception, too, that only cities are susceptible, in spite of the fact that some rural areas have been devastated. The most dangerous illusion one can have in a pandemic is that it is only happening to other people, someplace else.

The absurdity of some of the reopening measures—tattoo parlors?—raises the possibility that the public may be reluctant to follow the governors’ lead. Businesses may decide to stay closed or to keep their employees working from home. People may decide not to go to restaurants or malls or to take public transportation. But those with fewer financial resources may not have the luxury to choose safer ways of living. Last week, officials in Iowa and Nebraska made it clear that anyone who declines to go back to work will risk losing unemployment benefits. Many low-wage workers—in grocery stores, hospitals, and the meatpacking plants that Trump has ordered to stay open, even as they have become centers of outbreaks—have never stopped showing up. Moreover, as the COVID Tracking Project noted, in South Dakota, a state that is almost ninety per cent white, people of color account for close to seventy per cent of the confirmed cases—a reflection of the demographics of meatpackers, and of wider disparities.

Reopening should be something other than a lopsided reapportionment of risk. Nor can it rely on wishful thinking or luck. It requires hard, deliberate work, with clear prerequisites: testing, contact tracing, leadership, mask-wearing, individual discipline, and a willingness, if cases spike, to change course. It can be done, but we have to get it right. ♦

"['Katherine Dunn', 'Katherine Dun', 'Tony Earle', 'Deborah Treisma']",2020-05-05,The Resident Poet,"At his request, I am hiding in the parking lot. Every time lights show on the road, I jump behind a tree or crouch beside one of the cold parked cars. I don’t really care whether I’m seen or not, but I do plan to emerge mysteriously when he drives up. Impress him with my discretion, my knowledge of the surreptitious. But the rain is ruining the effect. I’m beginning to get angry. Who does he think would see us? Or care? I consider going back to my room and making a sign to hold up at passing cars: “I AM WAITING TO SCREW MR. LUCAS, THE RESIDENT POET!”

My mascara is running into the pouches beneath my eyes. I can feel the thin mud of powder on my forehead and cheeks beginning to slide.

The lights from the dormitories and the dining hall glow on the hill. No shapes around them, only blackness, and the moonless dark on me and around me. Another car turns off the main road. I stand behind a tree until it disappears up the long driveway to the college. I forgot to ask what kind of car he drives.

The spy game palls. I huddle under the tree and wish myself back in bed with a book and an inexhaustible supply of cigarettes. The image of my cozy self in a soft puddle of smoky lamplight grieves me.

I could have picked a less paranoid professor. But would that professor have picked me? Fortunately, the resident poet feels duty bound to fondle the freshmen, and I’m the only dope so far who has been susceptible to his paunch and poetry. And he’s the only dope susceptible to me. Unless he chickens out and I’m left soaking all night. If he’s not here when the moon comes up, I decide, I’m going in.

Light from the road, turning. A puttering of syncopated pistons. An old Volkswagen gasping and shaking into the lot. The headlights beam in odd directions, and eyeglasses shine through the dim windshield. I slide out from under the tree and squelch suavely toward the car. His face, gray and anxious, dips a smile at me. I get in on the passenger side, bringing the wetness in with me. Slam the door. He wheels the car around and rips out of the lot, down the driveway, and onto the road without looking at me.

When I first met him, I thought he looked like Ulysses S. Grant. All that curly black hair and curly black beard, the thick pink lips and square forehead. The more I see of him, the truer the resemblance seems. The light from the street lamps is slashed by the rain and ripples over his face. The spreading veins across his cheeks, the odd pits in the skin of his nose, the watery blue eyes, the secret weakness of his chin. He crops his beard so that it juts, instead of sliding toward his Adam’s apple along with his chin. His worries are bunched in lumps all over his forehead. At a stoplight, he gives me a quick, constipated grin.

“Nobody saw you?” His face turns back to the street, but I can see his eyes sliding at me in jerks, waiting for my answer.

“Only the fire department and your wife’s mother.”

His chuckle is a long time coming. His pudgy knuckles are pale green in the moving light.

“Would you mind crouching down in your seat until we get out of town?”

His apologetic teeth. The rasp in my breath. I drop onto the floor and prop my chin on the seat. Try to keep my wet boots from touching my ass. There are strange drafts down here, whispering through the framework, jets of cold squirting me in the back and the hair.

He looks very large. His stodgy shoes pump and move over the pedals at the end of his reliable wool legs. The gray cloth swags over his belly, droops from his arms.

“Do you think I’m crazy?” he says.

His fat lips. The pleading eyes. He’d rather be home in bed with his soft wife and a bottle of beer. I tip my head so that he can see my smile in the dark beneath the dashboard.

“Of course, you’re a lunatic.”

He is pleased. It’s so important to be crazy if you’re a poet. He reaches into his breast pocket. “I got something for you.”

A package of little cigars.

“Don’t these bother you? Your asthma? I wasn’t going to smoke at all.” I have prepared to be vicious for two days.

“No. I don’t mind cigar smoke. I can smoke these myself. It’s just cigarettes that make me choke.”

In his class, we sit with all the windows open, the rain blowing in. We don’t take off our coats. He always wears the same suit. It looks as though he’s stored potatoes in the pockets for a few seasons. The same plaid flannel shirts over improbable layers of underwear, or maybe that softness is his flesh welling up beneath the cloth. The clashing plaid tie is always just enough askew to allow his wiry chest hair to peep through at the collar.

“Have you eaten dinner? I haven’t. How about a hamburger?”

“Great!” I chirp.

Throw a few volts into the smile, a few more than usual, actually, because of the dark beneath the dashboard. The car wheezes to a stop. He removes the key and looks around, his eyes reflecting light. Then he smiles down at me and slips out. He leans in for a moment before swinging the door closed.

“Keep hidden just a little while longer. A lot of the students come here.”

His anxious face is gone with a flash of spectacles. I lift my head above the level of the window and watch his broken-butt trot across the shining tar. The big neon mouth on the sign prepares to chomp down on a seductively plump olive with an obscenely oriented pimento. He’s left me at the dark end of the parking area. Am I really going to wallow and stroke and gurgle and sigh over this character? Yes. What dull stuff I get into for the sake of excitement. I can see him through the café window as he casts furtive glances at the ragtag collection of customers, muttering his order at the waitress so that no potential blackmailers or squealers can hear him ask for two coffees and two hamburgers and two orders of French fries.

By the time he gets back to the car, I’m giggling. He hands me the lidded coffees. I balance them above the seat as he pulls out.

“I’m sorry about all this. You can get up now.”

My ass is numb and my legs ache. The chill has penetrated to my kidneys and set off a reaction. I pull myself onto the seat and open the coffee. Rest the cups on the gyrating dash. Rip open the hot, greasy paper around the food.

“I hope you like onions.”

“What did you tell your wife?”

Hand him a hamburger, smear a capsule of ketchup on the potatoes. He chomps and chews. “A weekend conference with a publisher.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/the-resident-poet

Experts predicted that Wednesday, April 15th, would be a peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, its epicenter. On that day, a crew of New Yorker writers talked with people all over the city, in many circumstances and walks of life, to form a portrait of a city in crisis. A group station manager for the subway talks about keeping the transit system running for people who rely on it; a respiratory therapist copes with break-time conversations about death and dying; a graduating class of medical students get up the courage to confront the worst crisis in generations; and a new mother talks about giving birth on a day marked by tragedy for so many families. The hour includes contributions from writers including William Finnegan, Helen Rosner, Jia Tolentino, Kelefa Sanneh, and Adam Gopnik, who says, “One never knows whether to applaud the human insistence on continuing with some form of normal life, or look aghast at the human insistence on continuing with some form of normal life. That’s the mystery of the pandemic.”

"['Nathan Heller', 'Nathan Helle', 'Charles Duhig', 'Ian Frazie']",2019-07-29,Was the Automotive Era a Terrible Mistake?,"The summer I was eighteen, I visited a parking lot forty-five minutes north of town and got behind the wheel for what I hoped would be the first real rite of my adulthood. I was tall, gangly, excitable. Less than a week earlier, following a brief stretch of test-taking at the Department of Motor Vehicles in San Francisco, I had received my learner’s permit. Learning in those days seemed easy. Tests were easy. Doing—when the matter arose at all—was hard. Behind the wheel, I made a show of adjusting the mirrors, as if preparing for a ten-mile journey in reverse. I surveyed the blank pavement ahead of me and slowly slid the gear-shift from park into drive.

Cars had been my first passion. As a two-year-old, I’d learned to recognize the make of vehicles by the logo near the fender or perched on the hood. I grew to understand the people in my life according to their cars; I learned what sort of person I was from my parents’ two old Hondas, one of which, a used beige Accord, I had gone with them to buy. My father’s lingering bachelor vehicle, a rotting yellow Civic, needed to be choked awake on dewy mornings, and I’d performed that job with relish, pulling out the knob beside the steering wheel, waiting a long moment, and pushing it back. This was the late eighties. Gas prices had fallen, and the roads were knotty with cars from across the world. I no longer remember what, as a small child, I envisaged for my future, but I know that it involved moving at speed behind the wheel.

Now, all those years later, the parking lot was virtually empty of cars, and I felt a flush of reassurance. I was learning in my parents’ highly defatigable ride, a minivan with an all-plastic interior and the turning radius of a dump truck. My teacher was my father, a flawless but not wholly valiant driver, who habitually refused to drive on certain bridges in certain directions, for fear of being, as he would put it, “hypnotized” by trusses passing alongside the road. For reasons lost to time, my little sister was on board, too, in the back. I eased my foot onto the gas; the engine revved for a moment, and the van lurched.

For the first time, I felt the seething power of the thing—not as a conveyance, which is how I had known cars in the past, but as a huge appetitive machine that interacted with the world through its own strength and expressed urges I did not. I was, I realized with a start, embarrassed at the wheel. It felt like being observed during a first attempt at slow dancing; my impulse almost at once was to use the brake. I did, and now it was my father and my sister who lurched.

“Oh, my God,” my sister said.

“Maybe a little bit gentler,” my father noted, sounding oddly placid, maybe hypnotized.

I tried again for forward motion, this time travelling what felt to me like a great distance at great speed. A few parked cars that had seemed safely remote drew very close. I braked again and surveyed my progress over my left shoulder. I’d achieved a commute of about ten feet.

Until then, despite having been in cars all my life, I’d failed to recognize the ease with which an errant movement, the equivalent of knocking into someone on a crowded bus, could bring about an injury or a death. As I jolted around the lot, I imagined myself on the road, in traffic, and felt a tight spasm of panic in my chest. I was eighteen. It had been all I could manage to remain on top of my un-botchable after-school job watering the neighbors’ bonsai trees. By the end of day, the idea of not driving—of not entering a future in which, day to day, I’d risk becoming an accidental killer of children—seemed freeing and bright. I never had a second lesson.

For years, I counted this inability to drive as one of many personal failures. More recently, I’ve wondered whether I performed an accidental kindness for the world. I am one of those Darth Vader pedestrians who loudly tailgate couples moving slowly up the sidewalk, and I’m sure that I would be a twit behind the wheel. Perhaps I was protected from a bad move by my own incompetence—one of those mercies which the universe often bestows on the young (who rarely appreciate the gift). In America today, there are more cars than drivers. Yet our investment in these vehicles has yielded dubious returns. Since 1899, more than 3.6 million people have died in traffic accidents in the United States, and more than eighty million have been injured; pedestrian fatalities have risen in the past few years. The road has emerged as the setting for our most violent illustrations of systemic racism, combustion engines have helped create a climate crisis, and the quest for oil has led our soldiers into war.

Every technology has costs, but lately we’ve had reason to question even cars’ putative benefits. Free men and women on the open road have turned out to be such disastrous drivers that carmakers are developing computers to replace them. When the people of the future look back at our century of auto life, will they regard it as a useful stage of forward motion or as a wrong turn? Is it possible that, a hundred years from now, the age of gassing up and driving will be seen as just a cul-de-sac in transportation history, a trip we never should have taken?

Among the captivating books to land on my desk recently was Dan Albert’s “Are We There Yet?: The American Automobile Past, Present, and Driverless,” which notes that, in the late nineteenth century, electric cars and gasoline cars developed side by side. One assumes that electrics were only notionally in the running at this stage. Surprisingly, Albert reports, gas cars were the B-fleet for years.

Turn-of-the-century electric cars were more maneuverable than their gasoline-powered counterparts. They had faster acceleration, better braking, and powerful torque, which compensated for the heft of their batteries. They set land-speed records—in 1902, an electric car briefly attained an astonishing hundred and two miles per hour—and, unlike internal-combustion vehicles, didn’t sputter out in traffic and need to be cranked up in the middle of the road. True, they had to be recharged every forty miles or so, about the distance from Mount Vernon to Grand Central Terminal and back, but few early motorists were travelling much farther. Electrical power was the moon shot of its age, quiet, futuristic, and the vanguard of human accomplishment. When Albert A. Pope, the head of the Columbia bicycle company, entered the car business, in 1896, he invested in electrics. “You can’t get people to sit over an explosion,” he explained.

Pope declared bankruptcy in 1907. Why did finicky, explosive gas cars win the field? Albert is a car guy by passion and vocation, a former curator of vehicle collections at the Science Museum in London. Today, he identifies himself as “n+1’s car critic,” an assignment that he clearly prosecutes with seriousness and pride. His book is interesting and idiosyncratic, occasionally at the same time, and tracks cars’ changing social and cultural position with an elegiac tone. “The road was once an open-ended adventure, full of wrong turns and serendipitous discoveries,” Albert writes. “Now the phone knows every mile and every minute before we leave the garage.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/29/was-the-automotive-era-a-terrible-mistake
"['Jonathan Zittrain', 'Jonathan Zittrai', 'Allison J. Pug', 'Kelly Clanc', 'Tad Frien']",2020-05-05,The Hidden Costs of Automated Thinking,"Like many medications, the wakefulness drug modafinil, which is marketed under the trade name Provigil, comes with a small, tightly folded paper pamphlet. For the most part, its contents—lists of instructions and precautions, a diagram of the drug’s molecular structure—make for anodyne reading. The subsection called “Mechanism of Action,” however, contains a sentence that might induce sleeplessness by itself: “The mechanism(s) through which modafinil promotes wakefulness is unknown.”

Provigil isn’t uniquely mysterious. Many drugs receive regulatory approval, and are widely prescribed, even though no one knows exactly how they work. This mystery is built into the process of drug discovery, which often proceeds by trial and error. Each year, any number of new substances are tested in cultured cells or animals; the best and safest of those are tried out in people. In some cases, the success of a drug promptly inspires new research that ends up explaining how it works—but not always. Aspirin was discovered in 1897, and yet no one convincingly explained how it worked until 1995. The same phenomenon exists elsewhere in medicine. Deep-brain stimulation involves the implantation of electrodes in the brains of people who suffer from specific movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease; it’s been in widespread use for more than twenty years, and some think it should be employed for other purposes, including general cognitive enhancement. No one can say how it works.

This approach to discovery—answers first, explanations later—accrues what I call intellectual debt. It’s possible to discover what works without knowing why it works, and then to put that insight to use immediately, assuming that the underlying mechanism will be figured out later. In some cases, we pay off this intellectual debt quickly. But, in others, we let it compound, relying, for decades, on knowledge that’s not fully known.

In the past, intellectual debt has been confined to a few areas amenable to trial-and-error discovery, such as medicine. But that may be changing, as new techniques in artificial intelligence—specifically, machine learning—increase our collective intellectual credit line. Machine-learning systems work by identifying patterns in oceans of data. Using those patterns, they hazard answers to fuzzy, open-ended questions. Provide a neural network with labelled pictures of cats and other, non-feline objects, and it will learn to distinguish cats from everything else; give it access to medical records, and it can attempt to predict a new hospital patient’s likelihood of dying. And yet, most machine-learning systems don’t uncover causal mechanisms. They are statistical-correlation engines. They can’t explain why they think some patients are more likely to die, because they don’t “think” in any colloquial sense of the word—they only answer. As we begin to integrate their insights into our lives, we will, collectively, begin to rack up more and more intellectual debt.

Theory-free advances in pharmaceuticals show us that, in some cases, intellectual debt can be indispensable. Millions of lives have been saved on the basis of interventions that we fundamentally do not understand, and we are the better for it. Few would refuse to take a life-saving drug—or, for that matter, aspirin—simply because no one knows how it works. But the accrual of intellectual debt has downsides. As drugs with unknown mechanisms of action proliferate, the number of tests required to uncover untoward interactions must scale exponentially. (If the principles by which the drugs worked were understood, bad interactions could be predicted in advance.) In practice, therefore, interactions are discovered after new drugs are on the market, contributing to a cycle in which drugs are introduced, then abandoned, with class-action lawsuits in between. In each individual case, accruing the intellectual debt associated with a new drug may be a reasonable idea. But intellectual debts don’t exist in isolation. Answers without theory, found and deployed in different areas, can complicate one another in unpredictable ways.

Intellectual debt accrued through machine learning features risks beyond the ones created through old-style trial and error. Because most machine-learning models cannot offer reasons for their ongoing judgments, there is no way to tell when they’ve misfired if one doesn’t already have an independent judgment about the answers they provide. Misfires can be rare in a well-trained system. But they can also be triggered intentionally by someone who knows just what kind of data to feed into that system.

Consider image recognition. Ten years ago, computers couldn’t easily identify objects in photos. Today, image search engines, like so many of the systems we interact with on a day-to-day basis, are based on extraordinarily capable machine-learning models. Google’s image search relies on a neural network called Inception. In 2017, M.I.T.’s LabSix—a research group of undergraduate and graduate students—succeeded in altering the pixels of a photograph of a cat so that, although it looked like a cat to human eyes, Inception became 99.99-per-cent sure it had been given a photograph of guacamole. (There was, it calculated, a slim chance that the photograph showed broccoli, or mortar.) Inception, of course, can’t explain what features led it to conclude that a cat is a cat; as a result, there’s no easy way to predict how it might fail when presented with specially crafted or corrupted data. Such a system is likely to have unknown gaps in its accuracy that amount to vulnerabilities for a smart and determined attacker.

As knowledge generated by machine-learning systems is put to use, these kinds of gaps may prove consequential. Health-care A.I.s have been successfully trained to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant. And yet—as a team of researchers from Harvard Medical School and M.I.T. showed, in a paper published this year—they can also be tricked into making inaccurate judgments using the same techniques that turn cats into guacamole. (Among other things, attackers might use these vulnerabilities to commit insurance fraud.) Seduced by the predictive power of such systems, we may stand down the human judges whom they promise to replace. But they will remain susceptible to hijacking—and we will have no easy process for validating the answers they continue to produce.

Could we create a balance sheet for intellectual debt—a system for tracking where and how theoryless knowledge is used? Our accounting could reflect the fact that not all intellectual debt is equally problematic. If an A.I. produces new pizza recipes, it may make sense to shut up and enjoy the pizza; by contrast, when we begin using A.I. to make health predictions and recommendations, we’ll want to be fully informed.

Building and maintaining a society-wide intellectual-debt balance sheet would probably require refining our approach to trade secrets and other intellectual property. In cities, building codes ask building owners to publicly disclose their renovation plans. Similarly, we might explore asking libraries or universities to accept, in escrow, otherwise hidden data sets and algorithms that have found a certain measure of public use. That would allow researchers to begin probing the models and underlying data on which we’re coming to depend, and—by building theories—make payments on our intellectual debt before it becomes due in the form of errors and vulnerabilities.

The growing pervasiveness of machine-learning models, and the fact that anyone can create one, promise to make this process of accounting difficult. But it’s vital. Taken in isolation, oracular answers can generate consistently helpful results. But these systems won’t stay in isolation: as A.I.s gather and ingest the world’s data, they’ll produce data of their own—much of which will be taken up by still other systems. Just as drugs with unknown mechanisms of action sometimes interact, so, too, will debt-laden algorithms.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-hidden-costs-of-automated-thinking
"['Sue Halpern', 'Sue Halper']",2020-05-04,How Cyber Weapons Are Changing the Landscape of Modern Warfare,"In the weeks before two Japanese and Norwegian oil tankers were attacked, on June 13th, in the Gulf of Oman—acts which the United States attributes to Iran—American military strategists were planning a cyberattack on critical parts of that country’s digital infrastructure. According to an officer involved, who asked to remain anonymous, as Iran ramped up its attacks on ships carrying oil through the Persian Gulf—four tankers had been mined in May—and the rhetoric of the national-security adviser, John Bolton, became increasingly bellicose, there was a request from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to “spin up cyber teams.” On June 20th, hours after a Global Hawk surveillance drone, costing more than a hundred million dollars, was destroyed over the Strait of Hormuz by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, the United States launched a cyberattack aimed at disabling Iran’s maritime operations. Then, in a notable departure from previous Administrations’ policies, U.S. government officials, through leaks that appear to have been strategic, alerted the world, in broad terms, to what the Americans had done.

During much of the Obama Administration, the United States’s cyber arsenal was strictly classified. As Michael Hayden, a former director of the N.S.A. and the C.I.A., told the filmmaker Alex Gibney in the documentary “Zero Days,” from 2016, “For the longest time, I was in fear that I actually couldn’t say the phrase ‘computer network attack.’ ” This past September, the Department of Defense issued a strategic plan that not only confirmed the existence of cyber weapons but declared its commitment to using them “to advance U.S. interests” and “defend forward.” The cyberattack on Iran in June was a manifestation of this new, more aggressive approach. (A spokesperson from Cyber Command, the military unit that oversees U.S. digital warfare, said, “As a matter of policy and for operational security, we do not discuss cyberspace operations, planning, or intelligence.”)

At Cyber Command, teams are assigned to specific adversaries—Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China, among them—and spend years working alongside the intelligence community to gain access to digital networks. Cyber weapons are stealth ordnance, written in zeros and ones, like all computer code. They can infiltrate whole networks or infect individual computers. They have the capacity to confuse enemy signals, shut down military attacks before they occur, and stymie communication systems, all without the flash and bang of the typical weapons of war. They rely on software vulnerabilities, poor cyber hygiene, and people who inadvertently open attachments infected with malware. According to Eric Rosenbach, the Pentagon’s cyber czar during the Obama Administration, speaking on the Lawfare podcast, offensive cyber activity is “painstaking work” that involves identifying a platform in another country, gaining access, and then remaining undetected, often for years, inside the system. While the cyberattack on Iranian maritime installations appeared to be an immediate response to the destruction of the drone, it was actually a long time in the making. “We didn’t just press a button,” Herbert Lin, a senior research scholar for cyber policy and security at Stanford, explained. “We’d done lots of work in advance to figure out what targets to hit and to maintain access to them. That happened months and years ago.”

Unlike most physical targets, which are stationary, digital targets are wily and dynamic. “A building is not going anywhere,” Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general, told me. “You have its coördinates. If you decide you’re going to take out that building, it’s fairly easy. But say they just upgraded all the computer systems in that building. You’re going to have to go back to the drawing board if you want to launch a cyberattack.” And, of course, an adversary can simply turn off a computer or shut down a network, taking the target with it.

Last year, the Pentagon gave Cyber Command equal status with the nine other combat commands, which include Central Command and Special Operations Command, an indication of the Internet’s growing importance as both a strategic domain and a military asset. Cyber Command, Spalding said, likely keeps a range of options available at any given time, all of which can be “dusted off” as needed. Until then, he said, “it’s all kind of notional.” That appears to be what happened in the weeks before the drone was shot down. “The boat thing happened, and there was a national-security planning meeting, and they wanted specific courses of action,” the cyber official said. “I mean, those things are already on the shelf, so the question was, Did they want the big enchilada that would inflict a lot of damage, or did they want small ones that would just send a little scare?”

As he described it, planning a cyberattack follows strict military protocol, moving up and down the chain of command as the parameters of an attack are determined, and its benefits and costs are assessed. President Obama had to sign off on all cyberattacks, but in August, 2018, Congress passed a military-authorization bill that allowed some cyberattacks to be authorized by the Secretary of Defense. Around the same time, the Trump Administration issued “National Security Presidential Memorandum 13,” a secret directive which reportedly further eased requirements for Presidential approval in certain cyberattacks. According to Brandon Valeriano, the Donald Bren Chair of Armed Politics at the Marine Corps University, under the old policy, there “was too much concern about authorities and legalities, and, by the time everything was signed off on, it was past the time to operate. The idea is that the new policy allows more leeway to rapidly react as situations evolve.” (Because the directive has not been made public, its specific contents are unknown; members of the House Armed Services Committee have repeatedly demanded a copy of the document, but the White House has thus far refused to release it. The spokesperson said that Cyber Command “does not act without Presidential authorization.”)

While the situation was evolving in the narrow shipping lanes between Iran and Oman, in late spring and early summer, private cybersecurity firms reported that Iranian hackers had stepped up their attacks, including what appears to be a sophisticated influence and disinformation campaign, on American institutions. This was to be expected. In 2011, Stuxnet, the joint American-Israeli cyberattack on an Iranian nuclear facility, disabled thousands of centrifuges. In response, the Iranians quickly mobilized their own technical resources to target at least forty-six U.S. financial institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo with cyberattacks carried out over the course of more than five months. They also infiltrated the operating system of a dam in New York State, in 2013; attacked the servers of a casino owned by the prominent Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, in 2014; and held the city of Atlanta hostage with a ransomware attack, in 2018. “Every single day we’re basically under attack at all levels—not just the military but private citizens, businesses, government, academia—everything,” Spalding, the retired Air Force general, told me. “To prevent adversaries from doing this mercilessly, you have to create a deterrent, and the deterrent is the fear of retaliation.” (Stuxnet—which was widely credited with prompting the seven-country Iran nuclear deal of 2015—has never been officially acknowledged by the United States or Israel.)",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/how-cyber-weapons-are-changing-the-landscape-of-modern-warfare
"['Dhruv Khullar', 'Dhruv Khulla']",2020-05-05,The Essential Workers Filling New York’s Coronavirus Wards,"The diversity of New York is on full display in its hospital rooms. Some days, I organize my rounds not by where patients are located but by what language they speak: Spanish, Chinese, English, Creole. That way, I can keep the same interpreter on the phone as I make my way from room to room. One in five Americans speaks a language other than English at home; half of New Yorkers do.

One morning, I gown up and step inside a patient’s room, the interpreter on speakerphone in my scrubs pocket. The patient is a deliveryman I admitted earlier that week; his breathing has worsened each day, requiring escalating doses of oxygen via nasal cannula, and now a face mask. I must tell him that, should his breathing worsen further, the next step will be intubation.

I speak carefully, in short paragraphs, pausing to allow the interpreter to translate. The man stares at me from behind his mask, waiting to learn what his future holds. Thirty seconds after I stop talking, as the interpreter completes her translation, his dark eyes widen, and slow recognition spreads across his face.

He asks what intubation entails, and I explain. Again a delay; again the unwelcome news starts to register. He asks how long he’ll remain on the ventilator. We can’t know for sure, I say, but I hope it’s not long. Tears escape his eyes and his breathing quickens. I worry that the conversation itself will tip him into extremis. During the coronavirus pandemic, I’ve avoided entering rooms more than once a day, but today I vow to return.

Outside, I rub foam sanitizer into my hands and remove my face shield. I forget that the interpreter is still on the line.

“Will that be all, doctor?” she says, a minute later, from my pocket.

“Yeah, thank you,” I reply. “That was pretty rough, right?”

“Yes,” she says. “There have been a lot of those conversations lately.”

In New York City, social distancing is working. The virus has claimed at least twelve thousand lives, but single-day deaths have declined steadily since April 7th, when nearly five hundred and sixty people died of COVID-19. New cases and hospitalizations have also fallen in recent weeks, even though many hospitals remain nearly full.

But, as this wave of the coronavirus starts to slow, I can’t help but notice that many of the people still getting infected are those who don’t have the luxury of distance—those who, by necessity or by trade, expose themselves and their families to the virus every day. We’re now debating whether it’s safe to reopen the economy, but for essential workers it never closed. Each morning, during the apex of the deadliest pandemic in a century, these men and women have been venturing out into the epicenter of disease, to cook and clean, deliver food and carry mail, drive buses and stock shelves, patrol the streets and tend to the ill. Many have paid with their health—some with their lives.

It’s becoming clear that essential workers experience a disproportionate share of death and disease owing to COVID-19. During one week not long ago, I cared for a police officer, a grocery-store clerk, and a bus driver. During another, my clinical service of fifteen patients included three food deliverymen. (The last time I can recall caring for a delivery worker was more than two years ago: his leg was broken after he was hit by an S.U.V. at a busy Manhattan intersection.)

The burden falls unevenly among racial and ethnic groups: in New York City, people of color comprise three-quarters of the city’s essential workers. Three-fifths of cleaning workers are Latino; more than forty per cent of public-transit workers are black. Latinos comprise twenty-nine per cent of the city’s population, but thirty-four per cent of all cases; black people are twenty-two per cent of the population but represent twenty-eight per cent of COVID-19 deaths. Many factors contribute. Communities of color have higher rates of poverty, housing instability, and chronic disease. They’re more likely to consist of dense or multigenerational households, in which the virus spreads more easily. These communities have experienced frequent, sometimes egregious, bias from the health-care system, which has engendered lasting mistrust and leads some people to forgo needed care.

In a pandemic, just going to work is risky. “All one has to do is stand on a platform and you’ll see that the trains are filled with black and brown and low-income people going into communities to service those who are able to telecommute,” Eric Adams, Brooklyn’s borough president, recently said. (About a hundred of the city’s public-transit workers have died of COVID-19 since the first M.T.A. worker death was reported, on March 26th.) And yet many essential workers have little choice but to stay on the job during the pandemic—either because they can’t afford to take time off or because they’re told that they aren’t allowed to. One study found that fifty-five per cent of retail and food-service workers, many of whom have been declared essential, have no paid sick leave, and fewer than ten per cent of them can take two weeks off—the recommended COVID-19 quarantine period.

The basic process by which doctors collect a medical history has not changed in a century. You start with a patient’s “chief complaint”—the primary reason for seeking medical care. You make your way through the “history of present illness,” exploring the onset, pace, character, and severity of symptoms. (When exactly did that cough start? What color is your phlegm? Does your chest hurt more when breathing deeply or walking quickly?) Then you move to preëxisting conditions, medications, and allergies.

Tucked somewhere down below is the social history. At its best, the social history is how we explore who patients are as individuals—how their jobs and hobbies and lives intersect with their current predicaments. It’s meant to illuminate how nonmedical factors may have contributed to illness, but also to give us a more complete understanding of what’s important to the person we’re caring for. For busy doctors, though, it’s often reduced to a few mechanical questions: Do you smoke? Drink alcohol? Do drugs? The entire social history in a doctor’s note might read, “No toxic habits.”

It’s turning out that, in this pandemic, social history is profoundly important. As we learn more about the epidemiology of the virus, I find myself exploring these details with great interest. Where do you live? How many rooms? How many people are in those rooms? Does your work require you to come in close contact with others? The answers reveal how much risk specific households and families are shouldering.

One of the many new faces in my hospital belongs to Khalid Haynes, a softspoken African-American man in his mid-twenties. COVID-19 has created administrative demands in addition to clinical ones; Haynes is one of many new patient coördinators who have arrived to keep the hospital running. (Other new hires have been helping to build new I.C.U.s, or transfer patients between facilities.) He began his career as a personal trainer, before starting work as a patient coördinator at an integrative-health clinic. There, he answered phones, greeted patients, and verified insurance; as the coronavirus began to spread across the city, his clinic turned to telemedicine, and he began working remotely. In late March, he received a call from his manager saying that he was being dispatched to the hospital as an essential worker. In his new role, he’d help troubleshoot and distribute iPads to doctors, so that their patients could see their families.

Haynes has kind eyes, horn-rimmed glasses, and an easygoing charm. During our first encounter, I rushed past in a pre-caffeine daze, and he stopped me to ask about my day, insisting on a genuine answer. Two weeks after he started at the hospital, his grandmother died of COVID-19. “That gave me a really painful perspective on how important this role is,” he told me. “I couldn’t see my grandmother before she died. I don’t want that to happen to anyone else.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/the-essential-workers-filling-new-yorks-coronavirus-wards
"['Clifford Marks', 'Clifford Mark', 'Trevor Pou', 'Robin Wrigh', 'Jiayang Fa', 'Atul Gawand']",2020-04-28,What We Don’t Know About the Coronavirus,"COVID-19 has been shown to damage multiple organ systems, including the lungs, the heart, the kidneys, and the brain.

We think of COVID-19 as a disease of the respiratory tract. When future generations look back on this pandemic, its iconic symbol will probably be the ventilator. But, although respiratory problems are at the core of the disease, COVID-19 has revealed itself to be more than a straightforward viral pneumonia. Doctors around the world—including in the emergency department where we work, at Mount Sinai Hospital, in Manhattan—have learned the hard way that the coronavirus doesn’t confine its ravages to the lungs. COVID-19 can push kidneys into failure, send the body’s immune system into catastrophic overdrive, and cause blood clots that impede circulation to the lungs, heart, or brain. It’s a disease of remarkable complexity, which even the most experienced doctors are struggling to understand.

On blogs, podcasts, and #medtwitter, members of the medical community have been trading stories and theories about COVID-19’s intricacies. Often, their conversation has followed the methodology of critical-care doctors. Physicians who work in I.C.U.s tend to talk not about symptoms or diseases—chest pain, diabetes—but about organ systems, which can malfunction and interact in complex ways. System by system, a picture of COVID-19 is emerging. Clarifying it may mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people in the months to come.

The shortness of breath that’s most characteristic of COVID-19 is reasonably well understood. It originates in the gossamer air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, where blood and air are separated by such thin membranes that oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass into and out of the bloodstream, respectively. Between them, the lungs have somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred million alveoli. Severe COVID-19 causes many of them to either collapse or fill with fluid. The virus attacks the cells lining the alveoli; our overactive immune systems, in trying to fight the virus, may be damaging them as well. The result is that not enough oxygen gets into the blood.

Doctors trying to solve this problem have two basic tools at their disposal: oxygen and pressure. They can give patients concentrated oxygen beyond the usual twenty-one per cent that is found in normal air. Alternatively, using a CPAP machine or ventilator, they can create a kind of sustained air pressure within the lungs—“positive end-expiratory pressure,” or PEEP—which keeps the alveoli open, and thus more receptive to oxygen, at moments when the lungs would ordinarily be emptier of air. (Imagine breathing in and out while leaning through the window of a moving car: that lungs-full-of-air feeling is PEEP.) Doctors have also been improving oxygenation by “proning” patients—that is, periodically turning them onto their stomachs. Such positioning takes advantage of gravity to match areas of air-filled lung with areas of higher blood flow.

All this makes straightforward mechanical sense. Still, mysteries hover around the certainties. Doctors track the “oxygen saturation” of patients with COVID-19—they monitor the percentage of hemoglobin molecules in the bloodstream that are currently carrying oxygen. Ordinarily, in patients with healthy lungs, an oxygen-saturation level below ninety per cent is cause for grave concern: when vital organs such as the heart and brain become starved for oxygen, the risk of death skyrockets. But doctors are finding, bizarrely, that some COVID-19 patients can remain subjectively comfortable even when their saturation levels fall far below these ranges. This “silent hypoxemia” is frightening for physicians, who associate such low numbers with imminent death. And it’s deeply mystifying, since the numbers seem implausible.

Is silent hypoxemia a sign that, even though a patient feels relatively well, the bottom is about to drop out? Or is the virus somehow interfering with the blood’s hemoglobin, or with the parts of the brain that warn us when we need more oxygen? Theories abound. Meanwhile, silent hypoxemia complicates the decision to intubate. In the early days of COVID-19 treatment, low oxygen saturation that failed to improve was generally seen as an indication that intubation was necessary right away. But in early March reports of comfortable patients with discordantly low saturation rates began spreading rapidly among doctors online. One particularly arresting image, posted on Twitter by a New York City emergency-medicine physician, shows a patient calmly reading on her phone while her overhead monitor reveals a saturation rate of just fifty-four per cent. Until we better understand the physiology behind silent hypoxemia, and why some people experience it and others do not, we will have no choice but to live with the mystery, scrutinizing some patients who have oxygen levels in the seventies and eighties, and whom we might have rushed to intubate in the past.

Within hours of a viral invasion, the body’s immune system swings into action. The “innate” immune system, which recognizes protein structures common to many pathogens, reacts first, by releasing a family of chemical distress signals called cytokines. They spread from the site of the infection, instructing the body to raise its temperature and divert blood flow to the affected area; they also activate other immune-system cells, which begin developing antibodies specifically targeting the invaders. Without cytokines, the immune system would slumber while infections wreak havoc. But the cytokine system has a weakness. Some pathogens can provoke it in a perverse way, so that it goads the immune system as a whole into overdrive. In what’s known as a cytokine storm, fever and inflammation spike out of control. It’s unclear why some patients might experience this phenomenon while others do not.

Faced with a cytokine storm in a patient, a doctor can try to modulate the immune system’s response. The problem is striking the right balance. While some patients may benefit from a degree of medically induced immunosuppression, there are others for whom such an intervention could cause great harm. Some hospitals have begun cautiously administering steroids or drugs that inhibit the cytokine IL-6. But high-quality clinical-trial data about such treatments won’t be ready for a long time. Moreover, even if early results are encouraging, we will still have to distinguish between those patients who will benefit from immunosuppression and those who won’t. In the past, physicians have interpreted elevated blood levels of the protein ferritin as a sign that a cytokine storm is in progress. Some are now using that analysis in the treatment of COVID-19. Only time will tell if they’re right.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/what-we-dont-know-about-covid-19
"['Sue Halpern', 'Sue Halper', 'Dhruv Khulla']",2020-04-27,Can We Track COVID-19 and Protect Privacy at the Same Time?,"Caroline Buckee, a top epidemiologist at Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health, has devoted her professional life to studying malaria and other infectious diseases. As news of a novel coronavirus emerged from China, Buckee realized that her area of expertise—how infectious diseases evolve as they move through vulnerable populations—would be valuable to health-care workers and elected officials as the virus spread across the globe. “The methods and the tools are the same, and epidemiological models are easily adapted,” Buckee told me. “But, for many of us, like me, we work with endemic pathogens. COVID-19 is new. There is so much we don’t know.” Since the most urgent imperative was to “flatten the curve” of infections, it was crucial to know where public-health strategies like stay-at-home orders were working and where they were not. Buckee quickly assembled a consortium of infectious-disease researchers to make the data accessible to policymakers—data that they did not yet have.

At just about the same time, Ian Allen, a former marine and C.I.A. paramilitary officer, cold-called Harvard’s School of Public Health and asked if there was anything that his new company, Camber Systems, could do to help with the pandemic. Soon afterward, Allen was connected with Buckee, the associate director of the School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. Buckee had created the COVID-19 Mobility Data Network, a network of epidemiologists from universities around the world, to try to track the efficacy of social-distancing measures. Allen agreed to provide Buckee with the software to query and scrub data collected by tech companies and use it to track the coronavirus’s spread without violating Americans’ privacy. “I wasn’t really expecting ever to hear back, assuming that Harvard, of all places, would have all the resources they’d ever need,” Allen told me, while standing in a field in rural Virginia as his son shot at tin cans with a BB gun. (Like many parents, Allen has been homeschooling his children during the pandemic; this was geometry class.) “Caroline asked me if we could help aggregate location data. Just aggregating the data and anonymizing it in the right way to protect privacy would take some of the burden off of her.” Allen reached out to a handful of data firms, including Unacast, Kochava, and X-Mode. All agreed to provide their data for free.

Camber Systems, of which Allen is the C.E.O., is a year-old startup that, among other things, hopes to offer federal, state, and local government agencies ways to use commercially harvested location data to improve their operations without violating privacy laws. Shortly before the pandemic, Allen and his business partner, Navin Vembar, a mathematician who served as the chief technology officer of the General Services Administration, were searching for potential clients, talking with officials in Madison, Wisconsin, about using location data to shore up tourism and distribute the city’s public resources equitably. Assisting Buckee’s COVID-19 Mobility Data Network was the kind of project they envisioned when they launched their company with Hangar, a venture-capital firm that funds companies that use technology in the public interest.

By presenting aggregated location data in an accessible and searchable format for epidemiologists studying COVID-19, the project would enable researchers and policymakers to see how members of the public move around their communities. When paired with other metrics, such as the number of new infections or mortality rates, the data would guide policymakers as they grappled with when and where to lift stay-at-home orders. Facebook is also supplying the network with data. According to Buckee, correspondence between the various groups gives researchers confidence in the trends they are seeing. “One data set is not going to show what’s going on,” she said.

Location data are the bread and butter of “ad tech.” They let marketers know you recently shopped for running shoes, are trying to lose weight, and have an abiding affection for kettle corn. Apps on cell phones emit a constant trail of longitude and latitude readings, making it possible to follow consumers through time and space. Location data are often triangulated with other, seemingly innocuous slivers of personal information—so many, in fact, that a number of data brokers claim to have around five thousand data points on almost every American. It’s a lucrative business—by at least one estimate, the data-brokerage industry is worth two hundred billion dollars. Though the data are often anonymized, a number of studies have shown that they can be easily unmasked to reveal identities—names, addresses, phone numbers, and any number of intimacies. As Buckee knew, public-health surveillance, which serves the community at large, has always bumped up against privacy, which protects the individual. But, in the past, public-health surveillance was typically conducted by contract tracing, with health-care workers privately interviewing individuals to determine their health status and trace their movements. It was labor-intensive, painstaking, memory-dependent work, and, because of that, it was inherently limited in scope and often incomplete or inefficient. (At the start of the pandemic, there were only twenty-two hundred contact tracers in the country.)

Digital technologies, which work at scale, instantly provide detailed information culled from security cameras, license-plate readers, biometric scans, drones, G.P.S. devices, cell-phone towers, Internet searches, and commercial transactions. They can be useful for public-health surveillance in the same way that they facilitate all kinds of spying by governments, businesses, and malign actors. South Korea, which reported its first COVID-19 case a month after the United States, has achieved dramatically lower rates of infection and mortality by tracking citizens with the virus via their phones, car G.P.S. systems, credit-card transactions, and public cameras, in addition to a robust disease-testing program. Israel enlisted Shin Bet, its secret police, to repurpose its terrorist-tracking protocols. China programmed government-installed cameras to point at infected people’s doorways to monitor their movements.

As unlikely as it may seem that such privacy-compromising measures will be adopted in the United States, the Trump Administration reportedly summoned tech executives to the White House to discuss sharing data with the government. Not much is known about the meeting. The Administration has classified all its discussions about COVID-19, and it later denounced Politico for reporting that the White House was in talks with tech firms to create a national coronavirus surveillance system. Last week, Gizmodo reported that Palantir, a secretive data-analytics firm owned by the conservative billionaire and the Trump backer Peter Thiel, has a contract from the Trump Administration to build a database to track the spread of the virus. Palantir is best known for its work with the N.S.A. and ICE, where its software is used to track undocumented immigrants. (Other private surveillance companies, most notably the Israeli firm NSO, are also pitching COVID-19 tracing to governments around the world.)

“We’re all too familiar with the historical record of crises, where new powers in the hands of governments and corporations lead to them holding on to them indefinitely,” Adam Schwartz, a lawyer with the digital-rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. Schwartz pointed out that most of the sweeping investigative powers given to the intelligence community after the 9/11 terrorist attack are still in place nearly two decades later. As Senator Maria Cantwell wrote, on April 9th, in her opening remarks for a paper hearing by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on the role of Big Tech during the pandemic, “Rights and data surrendered temporarily during an emergency can become very difficult to get back.”

As difficult as it is now to look ahead, lawmakers like Cantwell and privacy advocates like Schwartz are asking us to think about how much privacy we are willing to sacrifice to combat a rampaging virus. If we accept government data tracking, the surveillance necessary to curtail COVID-19 could become a permanent fixture in our lives. It’s an unknowable trade-off. “In this particular case, if we have technology for minimizing harm, we have a moral obligation to use it,” Marcello Ienca, a bioethicist at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, told me. “But we have to merge it with the best available technology in the areas of cybersecurity and privacy.” To do this right, Ienca added, the public-health experts need to work with privacy advocates.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-we-track-covid-19-and-protect-privacy-at-the-same-time
"['Sheelah Kolhatkar', 'Sheelah Kolhatka', 'John Cassid', 'Nick Paumgarte']",2020-04-24,How Will We Reopen the Economy After the Coronavirus Crisis?,"The daily coronavirus briefings of Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky, used to be sedate affairs. That changed on April 15th, when protesters began gathering regularly outside the window of his briefing room, in the Capitol building, in Frankfort, and attempting to interrupt the proceedings. “Open up Kentucky!” they chanted. “We want to work!” There were horns, whistles, and signs, including one that said “Quarantine is when you restrict the movement of sick people! Tyranny is when you restrict the movement of healthy people!” An activist stood on the Capitol steps and shouted, “We’re free citizens, and we can’t be told we can’t support our families. We can’t be told that we can’t work. How unethical is it of our leadership to say, ‘No, you can’t work’? It’s garbage! If you want to open your business, go open your damn business!”

Beshear, a Democrat, won the governorship by a little more than five thousand votes last November. On the first day of the protests, he paused his briefing and addressed the people outside the window, trying to appeal to rationality. “Folks, that would kill people. That would absolutely kill people,” he said. “My job isn’t to make the popular decision but to make the right decision, and the decision that saves people’s lives.” As of April 23rd, Kentucky has 3,481 confirmed cases and a hundred and ninety-one deaths from COVID-19, which puts it relatively low on the list of affected states. But Beshear’s dilemma is the same as the one facing leaders across the country. Many Americans, understandably, want to return to work. But reopening the economy would likely accelerate the spread of the virus, straining the health system, causing more deaths, and causing further economic damage. In the coming months, policymakers will be forced to navigate the complicated relationship between protecting people’s health and protecting their livelihoods.

There is no clear path for reopening the economy, and various groups have been issuing their own, competing plans. Last Friday, the governor of Minnesota announced that outdoor activities such as hunting and fishing could resume soon and that golf courses and driving ranges could reopen right away. In Texas, retail stores will be permitted to open back up for curbside shopping. But the governor of Maryland announced that restrictions there would not be lifted until there was greater access to testing, improved hospital space and equipment, and an effective contact-tracing system. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom suggested that people visiting restaurants in his state might have to have their temperatures taken before being allowed inside. On April 13th, President Trump suggested that he might force states to reopen their economies but more recently said that he would leave the question up to governors. The White House also released its own set of guidelines for how to move forward, called “Opening Up America Again.” “I think it’ll be really chaotic,” Dean Baker, the co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told me.

Most experts, regardless of political orientation, agree on a few principles about the recovery. The first is that the longer the economy stays in its current state of shutdown, the longer it will take to get it going again, and the more protracted the economic depression that will follow. “The longer we’re shut down, the more businesses we’re going to lose, and those businesses are what’s going to create the labor demand that will soak up our unemployed workers,” Michael Strain, an economist with the American Enterprise Institute, told me. Baker added, “Some workers won’t be able to come back. There will be incredibly complicated accounting messes; all these bills haven’t been paid for two or three months. Just getting a place up and running again takes time.” The second is that the rescue programs that Congress passed in March could mitigate the damage, but only if implemented effectively, and they still won’t go far enough. (The first stage of the program, intended to help small businesses, has already run out of funds.) The third is that widespread and accessible virus testing and effective infection tracing will be needed before most people will feel confident returning to their pre-pandemic ways of life. (The guidelines released by the White House mention testing but do not address how it would become more widely available.)

Most likely, the economy will come back online through what Strain described as a “staged reopening,” with different sectors switching on at different times. “What would that look like inside a city?” Strain said. “Continuing to prevent really large crowds, maybe opening up the smaller businesses first, having fewer people inside a store at one time. Then maybe you open up the restaurants, but people are spread out.” Larger establishments, such as department stores, would follow, with the time line ideally being driven by what can be determined about the virus’s spread through aggressive testing. It is hoped that the highest-capacity venues, such as stadiums and concert halls, could reopen in the summer. Many governors have pledged to work in regional groups to insure that the transition is as smooth as possible (such plans are already under way: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Delaware recently joined together to coördinate reopening plans.) Strain also noted that even a staged reopening will work only if local leaders can be nimble in response to contagion levels. “If we’re able to do this well, what you should see is pumping the gas pedal and then hitting the brakes,” he said. Schools may reopen in September, for example, and then, if the virus spreads too quickly, close again for two weeks in October. Social-distancing rules in restaurants may have to be continually adjusted. “I think we’re likely to see the virus respond to the level of economic activity, and, if the response is more than we would like, we’re going to need to slow things down again,” he said. “But I don’t know if our system of government is up to that.”

One proposed plan, published by several of Strain’s colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute, outlines the possible phases of a staged reopening. The first is the one we are currently in, when the focus is on slowing the spread of COVID-19 by shutting down public spaces and ordering residents to shelter at home; Phase II occurs on a state-by-state basis, “when they are able to safely diagnose, treat, and isolate COVID-19 cases and their contacts.” During this phase, Scott Gottlieb, an A.E.I. fellow, and his co-authors write, “schools and businesses can reopen, and much of normal life can begin to resume.” Physical-distancing measures may still be in place; vulnerable individuals may still want to limit their contact with others; and much more stringent public-hygiene measures should be adopted in public places. The third phase suggests that physical distancing and other restrictions can be removed when widespread disease tracing, treatment, and vaccines become available. (Vaccine tests are under way, but nothing is expected for at least a year.) After that, the report suggests, we should focus on preparing for the next pandemic. The authors write, “After we successfully defeat COVID-19, we must ensure that America is never again unprepared to face a new infectious disease threat.”",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/how-will-we-reopen-the-economy-after-the-coronavirus-crisis
"['Dhruv Khullar', 'Dhruv Khulla', 'Alessandra Colaiann']",2020-04-23,The Challenges of Post-COVID-19 Care,"Among the patients I care for at the hospital is a young woman recovering from COVID-19. To keep her blood oxygenated, she needs a device called a non-rebreather mask. The mask is connected by a tube to a one-litre translucent bag, which is in turn connected to an oxygen cannister in the wall; when she exhales, one-way valves shunt expired carbon dioxide into the room and prevent her from rebreathing it. It’s considered an advanced oxygen-delivery device, because it supplies more oxygen than a simple nasal cannula; it is also cumbersome and uncomfortable to wear. But the mask, my patient says, isn’t her biggest problem; neither is her cough or shortness of breath. Her biggest problem is her nightmares. She can’t sleep. When she closes her eyes, she’s scared she won’t wake up. If she does fall asleep, she jolts awake, frenzied and sweating, consumed by a sense of doom. She sees spider-like viruses crawling over her. She sees her friends and family dying. She sees herself intubated in an I.C.U. for the rest of time.

For many people infected with the coronavirus, the disease is mild. Asymptomatic infection is thought to be relatively common; here in New York, most people who need to be hospitalized have been discharged within days. But when the infection is bad, it’s really bad. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, COVID-19 patients who need to go on ventilators generally need them for much longer than people with other respiratory problems. For patients with severe emphysema, the average duration of mechanical ventilation is about three days; for those with other acute respiratory distress syndromes, it’s around eight. At our hospital, most of the COVID-19 patients who have needed ventilators have needed them for weeks. Extubation has been no guarantee of liberation: often, we’ve had to reinsert the tube within days, if not hours.

Prolonged intubation creates all sorts of problems. While patients are intubated, they need powerful sedative medications; many also receive paralyzing drugs to keep their reflexes from fighting the ventilator’s tube. (Some must be physically restrained to prevent them from pulling out catheters and tubes in their delirium.) Patients who survive intubation often find themselves profoundly debilitated. They experience weakness, memory loss, anxiety, depression, and hallucinations, and have difficulty sleeping, walking, and talking. A quarter of them can’t push themselves to a seated position; one-third have symptoms of P.T.S.D. A 2013 study of discharged I.C.U. patients, many of whom had been intubated, found that, three months after leaving the I.C.U., forty per cent of them had cognitive test scores one and a half standard deviations below the mean—roughly equivalent to the effect of a moderate traumatic brain injury. A quarter showed cognitive declines comparable to early Alzheimer’s disease. The longer patients were in the I.C.U., the worse the consequences became.

The joy we all feel when patients at our hospital survive acute COVID-19 is followed, quickly, by the acknowledgment that it could be a long time before they fully recover, if they ever do. Many will suffer through months of rehabilitation in unfamiliar facilities, cared for by masked strangers, unable to receive friends or loved ones. Families who just weeks ago had been happy, healthy, and intact now face the prospect of prolonged separation. Many spouses and children will become caregivers, which comes with its own emotional and physical challenges. Roughly two-thirds of family caregivers show depressive symptoms after a loved one’s stay in the I.C.U. Many continue to struggle years later.

Lindsay Lief, a critical-care physician at my hospital, runs a clinic for patients who have left the I.C.U., including those suffering from what’s known as post-I.C.U. syndrome. Lief got the idea for the clinic years ago, after caring for a forty-year-old woman from New Jersey who developed a serious infection, followed by profound septic shock. In the I.C.U., the woman’s kidneys shut down; she needed dialysis; she couldn’t breathe. She was intubated, extubated, intubated, extubated. When, after weeks of treatment, she was finally in stable condition, Lief began thinking about what it would be like for her to leave the hospital and return home. “This lady had such a traumatic I.C.U. course,” she said. “And I’m going to send her back to Jersey with no support—just a few papers about what we did? That seemed crazy.”

When Lief started the clinic, she saw patients by herself, most several weeks out from discharge. Lief would walk them through what had happened in the hospital—for many, it was a blur. She’d screen them for depression, anxiety, and P.T.S.D., and assess how they were managing at home. Were they gaining back the weight they’d lost in the I.C.U.? Had their sleep improved? She’d run through the medications they were taking and stop the ones that were no longer needed. Over time, she added psychologists, therapists, nutritionists, pharmacists, and social workers to her team.

“We try to offer holistic, whole-person care,” Lief told me. “Sometimes patients have already seen twenty doctors. They’ve had their scars, lungs, and eyeballs examined, but no one has asked, ‘How are you doing with all this?’ ” Patients, she learned, feel frustrated by their dependence on others. They can’t return to work; they’re forced to take taxis because they can’t climb the subway stairs. Others have trouble paying bills and keeping track of medical appointments. “Often, what these patients need is not a doctor,” Lief said. “They need physical therapy, occupational therapy, social interaction, case managers, financial planners. They need people to help them get their lives back.”

To contend with the flood of patients who will be extubated in the coming weeks, we’re planning to create a COVID-19 survivors unit—essentially an in-patient version of Lief’s outpatient clinic. The unit will bring together clinicians from various backgrounds: hospitalists, pulmonologists, rehab specialists, psychiatrists, dieticians, therapists. It will develop COVID-19-specific protocols, which we hope will help patients progress to a fuller recovery. Patients will receive daily “pulmonary rehab”—a stepwise approach to reducing oxygen support and slowly building strength and endurance. They’ll learn breathing techniques and get help with gadgets they can use to clear mucus from the lungs. Some will be shown how to cough better. Physical and occupational therapists will help them recover motor skills that may have diminished during their hospitalizations; psychiatrists and nutritionists will help with mood and food. Many patients, because they are too sick, or need oxygen, or because no rehab facility will accept them, will need to spend days or weeks recovering in the hospital. “The best thing we can do is create a home-like environment,” Lief told me. “The whole point is to help them stop being patients and start feeling human again.”

We tend to think of extubation as the point when a patient begins breathing independently. But, in fact, it’s possible to be extubated while still depending on a ventilator to breathe. If the thick intubation tube—inserted into the mouth, pushed through the vocal cords, and resting in the lungs—is left in too long, it can damage surrounding tissue; when that time comes, doctors make a small hole in the front of the neck, just below the thyroid gland, and insert a thin tracheostomy tube directly into the windpipe. This tube allows for a permanent connection to a ventilator. The patient has been extubated, but is no closer to his pre-coronavirus life.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/the-challenges-of-post-covid-19-care
"['Siddhartha Mukherjee', 'Siddhartha Mukherje', 'Jerome Groopma']",2019-07-22,The Promise and Price of Cellular Therapies,"It matters that the first patients were identical twins. Nancy and Barbara Lowry were six years old, dark-eyed and dark-haired, with eyebrow-skimming bangs. Sometime in the spring of 1960, Nancy fell ill. Her blood counts began to fall; her pediatricians noted that she was anemic. A biopsy revealed that she had a condition called aplastic anemia, a form of bone-marrow failure.

The marrow produces blood cells, which need regular replenishing, and Nancy’s was rapidly shutting down. The origins of this illness are often mysterious, but in its typical form the spaces where young blood cells are supposed to be formed gradually fill up with globules of white fat. Barbara, just as mysteriously, was completely healthy.

The Lowrys lived in Tacoma, a leafy, rain-slicked city near Seattle. At Seattle’s University of Washington hospital, where Nancy was being treated, the doctors had no clue what to do next. So they called a physician-scientist named E. Donnall Thomas, at the hospital in Cooperstown, New York, asking for help.

In the nineteen-fifties, Thomas had attempted a new kind of therapy, in which he infused a leukemia patient with marrow extracted from the patient’s healthy identical twin. There was fleeting evidence that the donated marrow cells had “engrafted” into the patient’s bones, but the patient had swiftly relapsed. Thomas had tried to refine the transplant protocol on dogs, with some marginal success. Now the Seattle doctors persuaded him to try again in humans. Nancy’s marrow was faltering, but no malignant cells were occupying it. Would the blood stem cells from one twin’s marrow “take” in the other twin?

Thomas flew to Seattle. On August 12, 1960, Barbara was sedated, and her hips and legs were punctured fifty times with a large-bore needle to extract the crimson sludge of her bone marrow. The marrow, diluted in saline, was then dripped into Nancy’s bloodstream. The doctors waited. The cells homed their way into her bones and gradually started to produce normal blood. By the time she was discharged, her marrow had been almost completely reconstituted. Nancy emerged as a living chimera: her blood, in a sense, belonged to her twin.

In 1963, Thomas moved to Seattle for good. Setting up his lab first at the Seattle Public Health Service Hospital and then, a dozen years later, at the newly established Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center—the Hutch, as doctors called it—he was determined to use marrow transplantation in the treatment of other diseases, notably leukemia. Nancy and Barbara Lowry were identical twins, and a noncancerous blood disease in one had been curable by cells from the other, a vanishingly rare occurrence. What if a disease involved malignant blood cells, as with leukemia? And what if the donor wasn’t a twin? The promise of transplantation had been hindered by the fact that our immune systems are inclined to reject matter from other bodies as foreign; only identical twins, with perfectly matched tissues, can sidestep the problem.

Thomas saw a way around this. First, he would try to eradicate the malignant blood cells with doses of chemotherapy and radiation so high that the functioning marrow would be destroyed, purged of both cancerous and normal cells. That would usually be fatal, but the donor marrow would then replace it, generating healthy new cells.

The next problems arose from trying an “allogeneic” transplant (allo, from the Greek word for “other”), using marrow from someone who wasn’t an identical twin. The resultant immune response is the consequence of an ancient system for maintaining the sovereignty of organisms. Sponges on the ocean floor use primitive versions of immune systems to reject cells from other sponges that might attempt to colonize them. Good defenses make good neighbors: in nature, chimerism, the fusion of one being with another, is not a new-age fantasy but an age-old threat.

Other pioneers in organ transplantation had learned that these forces of rejection could be blunted if the donor and the host were reasonably well matched. There were now tests to help predict compatibility and to improve the chances that allogeneic marrow cells would engraft. And various immune-suppressing drugs had been developed to further dampen the host’s resistance.

Thomas, who won a Nobel Prize for these studies, later described them as “early clinical successes.” But for the nurses and the technicians in Seattle who cared for the patients—not to mention the patients themselves—the experience could be harrowing. “Of the hundred patients with leukemia who were transplanted in those early years, eighty-three died within the first several months,” Fred Appelbaum, a former student of Thomas’s, told me. Sometimes the transplanted marrow failed to take, and the patient died from anemia caused by a lack of red blood cells, or from infections caused by the paucity of white blood cells; sometimes the cancer came back. He added, “What kind of person, with that rate of failure, would perform the hundred-and-first transplant?”

The final cataclysm, in this Biblical array of plagues, happened when white blood cells produced by the donor’s marrow mounted a vigorous immune response to the patient’s body. This phenomenon—called graft-versus-host disease—was sometimes a passing storm, and sometimes a chronic condition; either way, it turned the logic of immunology upside down. Typically, when foreign tissue is transplanted into a body, the fear is that the patient might reject it. But in these bone-marrow-graft cases it’s the transplant that rejects the patient. The immune cells of the bone-marrow donor—a mutinous crew forced onto an unfamiliar ship—recognize the body around them as foreign. Virtually every major organ system can fall under attack. In some cases, the disease proved fatal; in others, clinicians found ways to manage it with drugs.

In the late nineteen-seventies, Appelbaum and his colleagues analyzed the results of allogeneic transplants for leukemia, and found yet another surprise: the patients who had experienced graft-versus-host disease in its chronic form were also the ones whose cancers were least likely to relapse. The imported immune cells were effectively targeting residual cancer cells in the host. What Thomas had achieved with Lowry was akin to a regular organ transplant. (In 1954, in Boston, Joseph Murray had performed the first successful kidney transplant, also between twins.) But the phenomenon observed by doctors at the Hutch suggested that marrow grafts represented a very different kind of medical intervention.

From the start, those findings mesmerized the world of cell therapy. They showed that the human immune system—in particular, the T cell, a type of white blood cell that is central to what is known as “adaptive immunity”—could recognize and attack cancer. Which led to a question: Could T cells be trained to reject cancerous cells but not turn against the host? Could they be the basis of a new class of drug?

At this point, a larger question arises: What is a drug, anyway? A therapeutic substance, you might say. But does it have to be a molecule in its pure form, like aspirin or penicillin? Can it be a mixture of active ingredients—like cough syrup? A toxicologist might quarrel with the notion that certain substances are inherently therapeutic: water is a drug at one dose and a poison at another. Most chemotherapies are poisons even at the correct dose. Galen, the Greco-Roman physician of the second century, argued that all human pathology could be conceptualized as imbalances of humors—black bile, yellow bile, blood, and phlegm. Could a humor, drawn from a patient’s body, qualify as a drug?",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/22/the-promise-and-price-of-cellular-therapies

The handout says stick to “one small cup” of coffee and stay away from alcohol. But we all know that the coffee thing is B.S., and that it’s perfectly fine to have a glass of wine, because . . . they do it in France, right? What about that trending Times article, “Eating Nuts During Pregnancy Tied to Brain Benefits in Baby”? Or the fact that Kourtney Kardashian avoided microwaves after she had a baby?

Navigating this gantlet, when I was pregnant, I called a friend who had recently given birth. She cut me off, saying, “There’s a book you need to read.” The book was by Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University who studies health care. In her day job, she pores over medical journals and government data sets for insights into how we treat diseases such as Huntington’s, diabetes, and H.I.V./AIDS. In 2010, Oster got pregnant. Confronted with the usual mixed messages—her doctor told her that a glass of wine was “probably O.K.”—she went home, logged in to PubMed, a database of medical literature, and downloaded every study on alcohol and caffeine going back to the nineteen-eighties. She then spent several days performing a personal meta-analysis: evaluating the merits of the studies, throwing out the weak ones, and making an assessment of the risks. (Her conclusion: a glass of wine a day in the second or third trimester wasn’t a problem, and she could keep drinking coffee guilt-free.)

Oster’s research expanded into her 2013 book, “Expecting Better,” which became a hit among pregnant women—at least among the subset of pregnant women with the time and resources to devote to issues like caffeine dosage and sushi intake. In the book, Oster recounts the choices that she faced during her pregnancy and tackles such topics as prohibited foods, weight gain, and C-sections, frequently dismantling the received wisdom. Flatteringly, she addresses her reader as a peer. She doesn’t issue opaque decrees, with the implicit condescension of “Trust me, I’m an expert.” She doesn’t slip into cutesy jargon, like the pun-prone authors of the latest edition of “What to Expect When You’re Expecting,” who call pregnant women “Mama” and suggest that you “start every morning with a bump selfie.” Instead, she takes the reader on a tour of the scientific literature, even describing the methodology of specific studies to show how she made each decision. Lauren Kay, the executive editor of the pregnancy and parenting Web site the Bump, explained Oster’s appeal to me in an e-mail: “The whole tone of the book is very pro-Mom, putting the power back in the hands of the pregnant woman. I read it when I was pregnant with my first child, and it left me feeling empowered to ask my OB why or why not. It also reminded me that I was part of the equation, too.”

Despite the plaudits, the book didn’t go over well with many public-health officials, who disagreed especially vehemently with Oster’s conclusions about alcohol. The president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, on Boston’s NPR station, that Oster’s advice was wrong: “We need to err on the side of caution, and the side of caution says that we have not been able to identify any amount of alcohol that is absolutely safe in pregnancy.” But Oster’s fans were undeterred. Amy Schumer called Oster “the non-judgmental girlfriend holding our hand and guiding us through pregnancy and motherhood.”

Last month, Oster published a sequel, “Cribsheet,” subtitled “A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool.” It takes on subjects like cold season, nap schedules, and potty training. As the mother of a sixteen-month-old, I had a host of burning questions: Will she ever willingly wear clothes? Is it wrong to buy those little kids’ leashes? Why does she put her finger in other babies’ mouths and say, “Bite”?

Parenting experts have been around for as long as there have been anxious parents. They have channelled the fears and the aspirations of their times. Eighteenth-century parents adopted Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s ideas about “natural” parenting—cold air is good for a child!—even though he’d left all five of his children at a foundling hospital. Dr. Spock, who had trained in psychoanalysis, gave parenting advice a Freudian spin, and his mantra—“Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do”—soothed addled Cold War parents.

It makes sense that our parenting expert du jour is a data wonk. In some ways, data are to today’s parents what psychoanalysis was to the postwar generation: a hoped-for savior. We try to make sense of a chaotic world by reading Nate Silver’s political forecasts and wearing devices that count our steps. At the same time, Big Data is increasingly sinister. If you’ve been pregnant lately, you’ve undoubtedly had the eerie experience of seeing baby-related ads popping up online before you’ve shared the news with anyone. The information age has turned out to be a breeding ground for misinformation, with “Moneyball” giving way to Twitter bots, viral pseudoscience, and dubious Facebook news feeds.

Oster is here to help you navigate this glut. As a pop-economist, she follows in the tradition of Steven Levitt, of “Freakonomics” fame. Levitt, who has six children, including two who are younger than three, told me that Oster’s first book “is the bible of my circle.” At a time when pregnancy and child rearing have become polarized and moralized—natural births, water births, orgasmic births?—it can be refreshing to hear from someone who sticks to the numbers. “Economists focus on how the world is,” Levitt told me. “A lot of parenting advice is focussed on how the world should be in someone’s mind.”

What did I want from Oster’s books? Until recently, most of life’s outcomes seemed within my control. If I exercised, I could get in shape. (Not that I ever did.) If I worked hard at school, and then at my job, I could earn good grades and promotions. But becoming a parent was different. No matter how many pregnancy apps I downloaded, I couldn’t control when I would get pregnant, or if it would go well. And, after the baby arrived, I seemed to be stuck in crisis mode. The data seemed like a way to get back, if not power, then at least a sense of mastery.

Oster now has two children, Penelope and Finn, who are eight and four. She spends most of her days in her office at Brown, where she is currently researching methodological problems with data on health trends (vitamins, superfoods). Given the subject matter of her books, I thought it best to see her in the domestic sphere. I arrived at her home, in Providence, Rhode Island, at 6:30 a.m. It was still dark outside. Oster was standing at her kitchen counter in working-mom attire: a black business skirt and stockings, with a zip-up hoodie over her blouse to protect it from grubby hands. The place was neat but minimally furnished—an indication, to me, that she wasn’t especially interested in interior decorating. But I knew from her books that she likes to sew, and there were two plates of attractive muffins on the counter. She’d gotten up at 5 a.m. to bake.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/03/parenting-by-the-numbers
"['Elizabeth Kolbert', 'Elizabeth Kolber', 'Eric Klinenber', 'John Mcphe']",2019-04-01,Louisiana’s Disappearing Coast,"The New Orleans Lakefront Airport was built by the Louisiana governor Huey P. Long on a tongue of fill that sticks out into Lake Pontchartrain. Its terminal was designed by the same architect Long had used to build a new Louisiana state capitol and a new governor’s mansion, and it was originally named for one of Long’s cronies, Abraham Shushan. Within eighteen months of the airport’s opening, in 1934, Shushan had been indicted for money laundering and Long had been murdered. A few years later, the architect, too, went to prison.

Today, Lakefront Airport is used for small planes, which is how I recently found myself there, aboard a four-seat Piper Warrior. The Piper’s pilot and owner was a lawyer who liked having an excuse to fly. The plane took off to the north, over Lake Pontchartrain, and looped back toward New Orleans. We picked up the Mississippi at English Turn, the sharp bend that brings the river almost full circle. Then we continued to follow the water as it wound its way into Plaquemines Parish.

Plaquemines is where the river meets the sea. On maps, it appears as a thick, muscular arm stretching into the Gulf of Mexico, with the Mississippi running, like a ropy blue vein, down the center. At the very end of the arm, the main channel divides into three, an arrangement that calls to mind fingers or claws, hence the area’s name—the Bird’s Foot.

Seen from the air, the parish has a very different look. If it’s an arm, it’s a horribly emaciated one. For most of its length—more than sixty miles—it’s practically all vein. What little solid land there is clings to the river in two skinny strips.

Flying at an altitude of two thousand feet, I could make out the houses and farms and refineries that fill the strips, though not the people who live or work in them. Beyond was open water or patchy marsh. In many spots, the patches were crisscrossed with channels. Presumably, these had been dug when the land was firmer, to get at the oil underneath. In some places, I could see the outlines of what were once fields and are now rectilinear lakes. Great white clouds, billowing above the plane, were mirrored in the black pools below.

Plaquemines has the distinction—a dubious one, at best—of being among the fastest-disappearing places on Earth. Everyone who lives in the parish—and fewer and fewer people do—can point to some stretch of water that used to have a house or a hunting camp on it. This is true even of teen-agers. A few years ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officially retired thirty-one Plaquemines place-names, including Bay Jacquin and Dry Cypress Bayou, because there was no there there anymore.

And what’s happening to Plaquemines is happening all along the coast. Since the days of Huey Long, Louisiana has shrunk by more than two thousand square miles. If Delaware or Rhode Island had lost that much territory, the U.S. would have only forty-nine states. Every hour and a half, Louisiana sheds another football field’s worth of land. Every few minutes, it drops a tennis court’s worth. On maps, the state may still resemble a boot. Really, though, the bottom of the boot is in tatters, missing not just a sole but also its heel and a good part of its instep.

A variety of factors are driving the “land-loss crisis,” as it’s come to be called. But the essential one is a marvel of engineering. Thousands of miles of levees, flood walls, and revetments have been erected to manage the Mississippi. As the Army Corps of Engineers once boasted, “We harnessed it, straightened it, regularized it, shackled it.” This vast system, built to keep southern Louisiana dry, is the very reason the region is disintegrating, coming apart like an old shoe.

But if control is the problem it must also, by the logic of the Anthropocene, be the solution. And so a huge new public-works project is getting under way—this one aimed not at flood control so much as at controlled flooding. Ten pharaonic structures are planned. The furthest along of these is slated for Plaquemines Parish. It will feature enough concrete and riprap to pave Greenwich Village and, when operating at full capacity, will, by flow, be the twelfth-largest river in the country.

In one form or another, the Mississippi has been winding its way to the Gulf for millions of years. All the while, it has been carrying on its broad back vast loads of sediment—at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, some four hundred million tons annually. “I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river is a strong brown god,” T. S. Eliot wrote. Whenever it overtopped its banks—something it used to do virtually every spring—the river cast its sediment across the plain. Season after season, layer after layer, clay and sand and silt built up. In this way, the “strong brown god” assembled the Louisiana Gulf Coast out of bits and pieces of Illinois and Iowa and Minnesota and Missouri and Arkansas and Kentucky.

Because the Mississippi is always dropping sediment, it is always on the move, seeking new and faster routes to the sea. Its most dramatic leaps are called avulsions. In the last seven thousand years, the river has avulsed six times, and each time it has set about laying down a new bulge of land. Lafourche Parish is what’s left of the lobe laid down during the reign of Charlemagne. Western Terrebonne Parish is the remains of a delta lobe built during the time of the Phoenicians. The city of New Orleans sits on a lobe—the St. Bernard—created around the time of the pyramids. Many still more ancient lobes are now submerged.

The Mississippi’s most recent lobe is the Plaquemines-Balize Delta, otherwise known as Plaquemines Parish. It started to build about fifteen hundred years ago, after the river’s last great leap. The next avulsion is now overdue. Only human invention, in the form of steel and concrete, stands in its way.

Meanwhile, as the Mississippi has pushed lobe after lobe into the sea, the sea has pushed back. The delta’s soft, jello-like soils tend to de-water and compact over time, with the newest layers, which are wetter, losing bulk most rapidly. Where the river delivers enough sand and clay to make up for the lost volume, the land holds its own. Where compaction outpaces accretion, the land begins to subside until, eventually, the Gulf reclaims it. In southern Louisiana, to borrow from Bob Dylan, any place that is “not busy being born is busy dying.”

Such a mutable landscape is a hard one to settle. Nevertheless, Native Americans were probably living in the delta even as it was being created. Their strategy for dealing with the river’s vagaries, as far as archeologists have been able to determine, was one of accommodation. If the Mississippi flooded, they sought higher ground. If it shifted quarters, they did, too.

When the French arrived, they consulted with the tribes living there. In the winter of 1700, the colonists erected a wooden fort on what’s now the east bank of Plaquemines. Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville, the fort’s commander, had been assured by a Bayogoula guide that the fort’s site was a dry one. Whether this represented a purposeful misstatement or just a misunderstanding, “dry” in southern Louisiana being a relative term, the place soon flooded out. A priest who visited the following winter found soldiers wading “mid-leg deep” to get to their cabins. In 1707, the fort was abandoned. “I do not see how settlers can be placed on this river,” Iberville’s brother Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville wrote to the authorities in Paris, explaining the retreat.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/louisianas-disappearing-coast
"['Adam Gopnik', 'Adam Gopni', 'Larissa Macfarquha', 'Tad Frien']",2019-05-20,Can We Live Longer but Stay Younger?,"Aging, like bankruptcy in Hemingway’s description, happens two ways, slowly and then all at once. The slow way is the familiar one: decades pass with little sense of internal change, middle age arrives with only a slight slowing down—a name lost, a lumbar ache, a sprinkling of white hairs and eye wrinkles. The fast way happens as a series of lurches: eyes occlude, hearing dwindles, a hand trembles where it hadn’t, a hip breaks—the usually hale and hearty doctor’s murmur in the yearly checkup, There are some signs here that concern me.

To get a sense of what it would be like to have the slow process become the fast process, you can go to the AgeLab, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, and put on agnes (for Age Gain Now Empathy System). agnes, or the “sudden aging” suit, as Joseph Coughlin, the founder and director of the AgeLab describes it, includes yellow glasses, which convey a sense of the yellowing of the ocular lens that comes with age; a boxer’s neck harness, which mimics the diminished mobility of the cervical spine; bands around the elbows, wrists, and knees to simulate stiffness; boots with foam padding to produce a loss of tactile feedback; and special gloves to “reduce tactile acuity while adding resistance to finger movements.”

Slowly pulling on the aging suit and then standing up—it looks a bit like one of the spacesuits that the Russian cosmonauts wore—you’re at first conscious merely of a little extra weight, a little loss of feeling, a small encumbrance or two at the extremities. Soon, though, it’s actively infuriating. The suit bends you. It slows you. You come to realize what makes it a powerful instrument of emotional empathy: every small task becomes effortful. “Reach up to the top shelf and pick up that mug,” Coughlin orders, and doing so requires more attention than you expected. You reach for the mug instead of just getting it. Your emotional cast, as focussed task piles on focussed task, becomes one of annoyance; you acquire the same set-mouthed, unhappy, watchful look you see on certain elderly people on the subway. The concentration that each act requires disrupts the flow of life, which you suddenly become aware is the happiness of life, the ceaseless flow of simple action and responses, choices all made simultaneously and mostly without effort. Happiness is absorption, and absorption is the opposite of willful attention.

The annoyance, after a half hour or so in the suit, tips over into anger: Damn, what’s wrong with the world? (Never: What’s wrong with me?) The suit makes us aware not so much of the physical difficulties of old age, which can be manageable, but of the mental state disconcertingly associated with it—the price of age being perpetual aggravation. The theme and action and motive of King Lear suddenly become perfectly clear. You become enraged at your youngest daughter’s reticence because you have had to struggle to unroll the map of your kingdom.

The AgeLab is designed to alleviate this progression. It exists to encourage and incubate new technologies and products and services for an ever-larger market of aging people. (“Every eight seconds, a baby boomer turns seventy-three,” Coughlin observes.) Coughlin, who is in his late fifties, is the image of an old-fashioned American engineer-entrepreneur; he is bald in the old-fashioned, tonsured, Thurber-husband way, wears a bow tie and heavy red-framed glasses, and, walking a visitor through the lab, suggests a cross between Mr. Peabody and Q, from the Bond films, showing you the latest gadgets. His talk is crisply aphoristic and irrigated with an easy flow of statistics: each proposition has its instantly associated number.

“Where science is ambiguous, politics begins,” he says. “In the designation of some states, an older driver is fifty, in some eighty—we don’t even know what an older driver is. That ambiguity is an itch I wanted to scratch. Over the past century, we’ve created the greatest gift in the history of humanity—thirty extra years of life—and we don’t know what to do with it! Now that we’re living longer, how do we plan for what we’re going to do?”

Having picked the mug up, the suit wearer finds that setting the mug down gently on a nearby table is also a bit of a challenge. So is following Coughlin from room to room as he narrates all that the AgeLab has learned.

“Here’s a useful model for you,” he says. “From zero to twenty-one is about eight thousand days. From twenty-one to midlife crisis is eight thousand days. From mid-forties to sixty-five—eight thousand days. Nowadays, if you make it to sixty-five you have a fifty-per-cent chance you’ll make it to eighty-five. Another eight thousand days! That’s no longer a trip to Disney and wait for the grandchildren to visit and die of the virus you get on a cruise. We’re talking about rethinking, redefining one-third of adult life! The greatest achievement in the history of humankind—and all we can say is that it’s going to make Medicare go broke? Why don’t we take that one-third and create new stories, new rituals, new mythologies for people as they age?”

The agnes suit is one of many instruments and appliances—or “cool toys,” as they are more technically known—that can be found in the AgeLab’s glass-walled halls and cubicled corridors, ready to entertain visiting writers, and to instruct visiting entrepreneurs. There is the driving simulator, specially fitted to track the driver’s eye movements as they flit back and forth from the dashboard to the horizon. (“With its new technologies, like navigation systems, the automotive industry is asking people to change fifty years of driving habits in ten minutes without instruction,” Coughlin says.) There is Paro, a robotic baby seal, from Japan, which bleats and moves its head, and is designed to act as a comfort to aging people, particularly Alzheimer’s patients struggling with the “sundown” moment at day’s end, when confusion and restlessness become acute. (“It’s a seal, rather than a dog or a cat, because people have great experiences with dogs and cats, and even Alzheimer’s patients can spot the eerie non-resemblance,” Coughlin says. “Having no experience of seals, we accept Paro as he is.”) There are mobile robotic nurses made for elderly care, and broad red upholstered chairs made for elderly rears. There are large research displays showing photographs of drivers, their faces embedded with sensors, and the varieties of “Glance Classification” that can, when analyzed, lead to “Crash Avoidance.” (“The ratio between confident decisions and correct confident decisions can be a story of life or death on the highway,” Coughlin explains.) And there are displays of word clouds associated with aging, showing the significant difference between the terms with which women imagine their post-career lives (Freedom, Time, Family) and those which men use (Retirement, Relax, Hobbies).

The work of the AgeLab is shaped by a paradox. Having been established to engineer and promote new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged, the AgeLab swiftly discovered that engineering and promoting new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged is a good way of going out of business. Old people will not buy anything that reminds them that they are old. They are a market that cannot be marketed to. In effect, to accept help in getting out of the suit is to accept that we’re in the suit for life. We would rather suffer because we’re old than accept that we’re old and suffer less.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/can-we-live-longer-but-stay-younger
"['Kerry Elson', 'Kerry Elso', 'Jessica Delfin', 'Sara Lautma', 'Ysabel Yate', 'Ali Kelley']",2020-05-02,How to Relax with a Candle While Thoroughly Following Candle-Safety Protocol,"Are you ready to totally relax with a candle? No? Let’s try it anyway. Cuddle up with a flame-retardant blanket and take a tentative seat because it’s candle relaxation time! Here are steps for getting started:

Write a letter to your niece, just in case she decides to visit and finds only a pile of ash. You could say something like “I was trying to relax with one of my candles. Hope you’re well. Please take care of my gem collection.”

Survey the many candles your friends have given you, spread out on your kitchen table, coated in dust. Rearrange them a little bit. Now you’re one step closer to lighting your first candle, all by yourself!

Pick up a candle and try reading the label. Unfortunately, all it says is “Gardenia and orange blossom. Good luck and try your best. Sincerely, California Candles.”

Get renters’ insurance. This is a good idea in general, actually. Tell everyone you encounter to get renters’ insurance, because you never know what might happen. Send your friends text messages about renters’ insurance. Write a LinkedIn post about it, and then create a Snapchat story about renters’ insurance for the young people. Also, make a TikTok video. Don’t forget to write a book. Great job! You’ve continued to delay lighting your candle.

Think about how you would light a candle, if you were to light one. Snapping your fingers is, unfortunately, not an option. Locate the lighter you bought in high school to look cool. Spend twenty minutes trying to get it to ignite. Acknowledge that it’s a really old lighter and deserves to retire. Visit a hardware store and look for matches. Go ahead and buy the big box of matches! Once you figure out how to light a candle, you will probably be lighting them all the time.

When you get home, clear everything from the kitchen table. Put away all the newspapers, the wooden salt and pepper grinders, the shopping bags, and your gems. Put your chosen candle in the middle of the table and place the matchbox next to it.

Load the candle into the candle holster. If you don’t have a candle holster, you can also use a candle harness. Both of these are simple contraptions that you can make with rubber bands, twist ties, duct tape, and magnets.

Secure the candle holster or harness to the table so that the candle absolutely cannot tip over, even if you were to skip pebbles in the candle’s direction.

Build a brick fortress around the candle. If the candle does tip over somehow, despite your precautions, the bricks will trap the flames, keep you safe, and protect your gems. Make sure to leave an opening at the top of the fortress so that oxygen can reach the candle and the fire can keep burning. Remember, your goal is to light a flame so that you can look at it, think about eternity, and begin your hundred-per-cent, no-holds-barred relaxation experience.

Light the match. No, you have to do it because no one else is here. Do it quickly. Now reach over the fortress walls, hold the flame to the wick, and light that wick. Blow out the match. Done! Wipe your sweaty hands on your shirt.

Ease into your chair, gently place your hands in your lap, and sit.

No, you can’t look at your phone. Just sit there with your feet flat on the floor, preferably away from any part of the table, for extra safety. Imagine you are that tiny flame, gently surging and striving to get out of your seat. Nope, sit back down.

Count to thirty. You lit that candle and you’re sitting across from it. You did it! Feel proud that you conquered your fear of small fires and lit your first candle on your own. Take a photo of your candle and post it on Instagram.

Receive a call from your mom, who saw your Instagram post. Listen to her say, “I see that you are relaxing with a candle. Did you know that a thousand and forty-six people died last year because they lit a candle, the candle fell over, and then they caught on fire? You can make your own decisions. That is all I wanted to say.”

Blow out the candle. Feel your shoulder muscles un-tense. Take a deep breath. At last, you can truly relax.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/how-to-relax-with-a-candle-while-thoroughly-following-candle-safety-protocol
"['Françoise Mouly', 'Françoise Moul']",2020-05-05,Christoph Mueller’s “Shelter in Place”,"The coronavirus has hit different countries in different ways, but billions of people worldwide are now living with some kind of restriction on public life. This week’s cover, by Christoph Mueller, an artist based in Germany, portrays a now common experience: seeing life, and the bloom of spring, through a window. We talked to Mueller recently about the image.

Europe has been in quarantine for more than a month. Have you still been able to enjoy strolls in nature? And, if so, how has the experience shifted?

My wife, Leonie, and I live close to the Dutch border, and our favorite getaway is a small heathland nature reserve in the Netherlands. It’s an incredibly beautiful place that has an almost spiritual effect on me. Unfortunately, nonessential people are not allowed to cross the borders at the moment, so we’ve switched to taking our strolls through small local parks. They’re nice, but I do miss those Dutch pines. Fortunately, we had a chance to collect some seeds during our last visit to the heathlands, and we’re now growing a pine forest in the living room of our apartment.

Has sheltering in place made you more or less aware of what’s going on outside your window?

Much more aware—and I mean that quite literally. I’ve developed a habit of looking out the window right after I get up in the morning: I step into the living room, greet Wembley and Schlomi, our two cockatiels, and stare outside the window for a while, almost like I am searching for some sort of confirmation, for signs of normality, some real-life feedback that lets me know that we’ll be O.K. for another day. After that, I check on our baby pines and make coffee.

Does your approach shift when you set out to tell a story in one image, like this cover, versus a comic strip?

I don’t think I’ve ever thought about that. Usually, I start with the specs of what I’m aiming for, do my research, and keep thinking about it until I arrive at some sort of emotional starting point. Then the image or images just sort of work their way through my hand onto the paper. I try to not overthink the underlying mechanics too much.",newyorker,http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2020-05-11
"['Adam Kirsch', 'Adam Kirsc', 'Judith Thurma', 'Alex Ros']",2020-05-05,Søren Kierkegaard’s Struggle with Himself,"Imagine an educated, affluent European in his late twenties, seemingly one of fortune’s favored, who suffers from crippling feelings of despair and guilt. For no apparent reason, he breaks up with the woman everyone thought he was going to marry—not because he loves someone else but out of a sudden conviction that he is incapable of marriage and can only make her miserable. He abandons the career for which he has been studying for ten years and holes up in his apartment, where a kind of graphomania compels him to stay up all night writing at a frantic pace. His activity is so relentless that, in a few short years, he has accumulated many volumes’ worth of manuscripts.

If this happened today—say, in Denmark, the standard example of a rational modern society—the man would sooner or later end up in a psychiatrist’s office, where he would probably be given a diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder. He would start seeing a therapist and might be prescribed medication. The goal would be to get him back to normal, as the world defines “normal”: able to take pleasure in life, to form relationships, to meet his obligations as a family member, friend, and citizen. The man would seek professional help, because, in the twenty-first century, he would recognize his propensities as symptoms—evidence of a psychological problem.

But when Søren Kierkegaard underwent these experiences in the Denmark of the eighteen-forties they had a different meaning. “At times, there is such a noise in my head that it is as though my cranium were being lifted up, it is exactly like when the hobgoblins lift a mountain up a little and then hold a ball and make merry inside,” he wrote in his journal in February, 1838, when he was twenty-four. But Kierkegaard had learned from Romantic literature that wild emotion was a sign of genius, especially when it was painful. “Real depression, like the ‘vapors,’ is found only in the highest circles, in the former case understood in a spiritual sense,” he wrote two months later. He considered his “melancholy” not a disease but a “close confidant . . . the most faithful mistress I have known.”

Side by side with this fashionable style of feeling, Kierkegaard inherited from his ancestors a rigorously introspective Protestantism. His father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard, had grown up poor in the countryside, moved to Copenhagen to become a merchant, and ended up as one of the city’s richest men. Michael Pedersen raised his seven children, of whom Søren was the youngest, under strict religious discipline, instilling a sense of fear and guilt that never left them. “Oh, how frightful it is when for a moment I think of the dark background of my life, right from the earliest days!” Kierkegaard recalled. “The anxiety with which my father filled my soul, his own frightful melancholy.”

For Kierkegaard, unhappiness became not a condition but a vocation. In a new biography, “Philosopher of the Heart” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), the British scholar Clare Carlisle shows that this calling consumed his life. After leaving school, at the age of seventeen, in 1830, he enrolled as a theology student at the University of Copenhagen, in order to prepare for a career in the church. But it took him ten years to complete his degree, and he never became a pastor or had any other kind of job. He never got married or had children. Other than a few visits to Berlin, then the capital of philosophy, and one trip to Sweden, Kierkegaard never left Denmark. He took no interest in politics. In 1848, the liberal revolutions sweeping Europe reached Denmark, as protests forced the king to promise a new constitution and parliament; but Kierkegaard was indifferent. “So the king flees—and so there is a republic,” he wrote in his journal that year. “Piffle.”

What he did instead was write. Until his death, in 1855, at the age of forty-two, Kierkegaard lived off his inheritance and produced a stream of unclassifiable books—hybrids of philosophy, autobiography, fiction, and sermon. Advancing deeper and deeper into the experience of suffering, he emerged with a profoundly new way of thinking about human existence. The dark exigency of Kierkegaard’s books, which he sometimes published two or even four at a time, is plain from their titles: “Fear and Trembling,” “The Concept of Anxiety,” “The Sickness Unto Death.”

In that last book, which appeared in 1849, Kierkegaard offers an uncompromising diagnosis of the human condition. “There is not a single human being who does not despair at least a little, in whose innermost being there does not dwell an uneasiness, an unquiet, a discordance, an anxiety in the face of an unknown something,” he writes. If you don’t think you are in despair, you are lying to yourself, which is an even worse form of despair. Only by acknowledging our condition, he says, can we begin to understand that the true name of despair is sin, defiance of God. We are freed from it only when we accept that “a human self is under an obligation to obey God—in its every secret desire and thought.”

This understanding of sin and redemption wasn’t Kierkegaard’s invention. Something like it was preached in Denmark’s Lutheran churches every Sunday. What made his work explosive was his insistence that those very churches had become the chief obstacles to genuine Christian belief. Nineteenth-century Europeans took for granted that they were Christians simply because they were living in “Christendom,” in countries where there were “just as many Christians as there are people,” he wrote. But a Christian, for Kierkegaard, isn’t something you are born; it is something you have to become through terrific inner effort. His “authorship,” as he called it, was meant as an alarm bell to wake the modern world from its spiritual slumber.

Kierkegaard published his books at his own expense, and they initially had a tiny readership: the most popular, “Either/Or,” didn’t sell out its first edition of five hundred and twenty-five copies for three years. Nevertheless, he became a local celebrity, thanks mainly to his eccentricities and his penchant for public feuds. The editor of one Copenhagen paper, the Corsair, observed that, in “Kierkegaard’s entire personal appearance and manner, there was something that verged on the comic.” When the Corsair portrayed him in a series of mocking caricatures, in 1846, he became even more notorious. “Every kitchen boy feels justified in almost insulting me . . . young students titter and grin and are happy to see a prominent person trampled on,” he complained.

When he died—probably of tuberculosis, though the diagnosis remains unclear—Kierkegaard had few if any readers outside Denmark. That didn’t begin to change until he found an influential champion in the Danish literary critic Georg Brandes, who, in 1877, wrote the first book about Kierkegaard and brought him to the attention of a wider European audience. (Later, Brandes did the same for Nietzsche.) The first English translations of Kierkegaard appeared in the nineteen-thirties, and it wasn’t until the sixties, more than a century after his death, that the translators Howard and Edna Hong began to produce a complete English edition of his works.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/soren-kierkegaards-struggle-with-himself
"['Anthony Lane', 'Anthony Lan']",2020-05-05,Streaming Releases Test the Waters of a Changed Industry,"In the olden days, which, according to historians, ended a few months ago, people used to do the strangest things. They exchanged what were known as “hugs,” presumably a unit of currency, or else “handshakes,” which, judging by the name, may well have been a strain of palsy. “Going out for a drink” entailed gathering at some form of communal well, an obvious source of infection. There was also something called “making out.” Ethnological research has identified this as ritualistic playacting, often terminating in humiliation. No activity from that far-off period, however, seems as inexplicable as this: humans went to the movies.

Details are scarce, and memories are hazy, including my own. But I seem to recall that we sat in a blacked-out room, in rows, and frequently in discomfort. We did so of our own volition, and paid for the privilege, even though screenings began at an appointed hour and—imagine this!—the content had been determined, in advance, on our behalf. Interactivity stood at zero. We could neither quicken nor freeze the action, and those wishing to follow a narrative in its entirety were forced to develop ferocious bladder control. Drinks and foodstuffs were allowed, but only if purchased on the premises and guaranteed to promote active dental decay. Why we tolerated these outrageous restrictions on our personal liberty, and why some of us persisted in venturing out to the cinema rather than staying at home to view a product of our choosing, while snacking on crap from our own fridge, is a puzzle that may never be solved. Perhaps our minds were unsound.

Now, of course, that option no longer exists. Movie theatres are closed across America, especially in the larger and denser cities. Even if you stumble upon a venue that has remained open, stop and think. In all honesty, you should no more watch a new release in the company of coughing strangers than you should visit your grandma and give her a birthday hug. And, anyway, what is there to watch?

One of the first signs that COVID-19 would play havoc with our moviegoing habits came with the news that 007 was running scared. The world première of the new James Bond film, bearing the deeply unfortunate title “No Time to Die,” was meant to take place at the Royal Albert Hall, in London, on March 31st. Oh, to be in England, now that Bond was there! The plan was for the movie to open in the United States on April 10th, and the publicity machine had been pumping away for months. The trailers were out; the talk shows were booked; the Aston Martin was having a final wax. Then the blow fell. “No Time to Die” will now be released in November—a relief for Daniel Craig, who can throw his tux back in the wardrobe, put on a sweater, and get out the Scrabble board, but a wrenching loss for the rest of us. The chance to revel gaily in the latest Bond production, and then to lament that it wasn’t as good as the last one, or the one before that, or the one with the Japanese volcano, comes along every four or five years, and is connected to the great circle of life. Without 007, how shall we endure the spring?

As with Bond, so with “Mulan.” Disney and other studios have delayed the explosion of their major films. Marvel has shunted “Black Widow” to November 6th, and another of its offerings, “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” all the way to May, 2021. I’m not sure I can wait that long. “A Quiet Place Part II” has tiptoed softly to September, and other follow-ups have taken to their heels; somehow, we must get through this year without fresh installments of “Peter Rabbit” and “Fast & Furious.” Maybe those two should cut their losses and merge into one mega-sequel, with Vin Diesel as Mr. McGregor.

Procrastination, though, is not the only game in town. There has also been brinkmanship, with the studios eying each other and wondering: Who will be the first to blink? Who will think, Screw it—let’s forget about a motion-picture event, scrap the launch, and switch to a streamed release? Prophets of a gloomy bent believe that history is curving in this direction anyway: that cinemas are fated to fall into disuse, with tumbleweed rolling in the aisles, and that the future of film belongs online, where the new Spielberg, say, or the new Bong Joon-ho, will have to hold its own against outtakes from “Friends” and videos of cats wearing hats. If this argument is correct, the coronavirus has merely hastened the inevitable, and we should honor, not pity, the movie that has paid the ultimate price, forgoing the majesty of the large screen for the sake of a digital download. Such a sacrifice will never be forgotten. That movie is “Trolls World Tour.”

The first “Trolls” movie came out in 2016. It made three hundred and forty-seven million dollars. If, owing to some tragic oversight, you failed to see it, you should know that it was a candy-colored, song-stuffed, sparkle-strewn, computer-animated film that hymned the virtues of dancing, hugging, and finding your happy place. For those of us who assumed that a troll was some gnarly bastard from Norse legend, or a costive hermit harassing celebrities on his laptop, these rebooted Trolls, inexorably genial, came as a surprise. They made the Cabbage Patch Kids look like the Trojan Women.

The new film repeats the prescription, with a spoonful of scares to help the sugar go down. The dainty-hearted Queen Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) learns that Barb (Rachel Bloom), who rules the Rock Trolls, wants to eradicate all other kinds of music, not least the meaningless pop that lends both value and depth to Poppy’s existence. With the aid of her pal Branch (Justin Timberlake), Poppy embarks on a mission to save Trollkind, and to slather us with a message of creamy togetherness. All yours to rent, for just under twenty dollars.

But will you rent it? The rationale is clear enough. With families trapped inside by COVID-19, and children out of school and starting to climb the walls, a hyperactive new movie ought to be just the ticket. Also, twenty bucks is less than you’d pay at the cinema for yourself, your kids, and your silo-size Cokes. Yet the sum feels extortionate when you’re shelling out at home, perhaps because it carries a sweaty whiff of boxing bouts on pay-per-view. You half expect Tyson Fury, and you get Queen Poppy. In short, “Trolls World Tour” is a test case. To date, having earned almost a hundred million dollars online, this proud herald of the streaming age is well on the way to finding its happy place.

Thus far, of all the films that were made with meaty budgets and destined for a wide release, “Trolls World Tour” alone has traded the multiplex for a slot on your TV, or your annoyingly cracked phone. Smaller independent movies, though, are already making the jump, as if more confident of recouping their costs. Take “True History of the Kelly Gang,” adapted from Peter Carey’s novel of the same title and directed by Justin Kurzel. Set and shot in Australia, it stars George MacKay (who played the lone hero in “1917”) as Ned Kelly and features Russell Crowe, impenetrably bearded, in a minor role. The total budget, I reckon, might just about have covered the special effects in “Black Widow,” not counting Scarlett Johansson’s boots.",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/streaming-releases-test-the-waters-of-a-changed-industry
"['Zach Helfand', 'Zach Helfan', 'John Cassid', 'Charles Bethe']",2020-05-05,The New York Renters Who Can’t Pay May,"Two rent payments ago, Donald Trump announced what he termed some “really positive things” for millions of people who were nervous about evictions during the economic shutdown. “Landlords are going to take it easy!” he said. This was not rhetoric: Trump International Hotel, in Washington, D.C., soon asked for rent relief from its own landlord, the federal government, which has yet to announce a decision on whether to grant it. (Evictions continued apace at the real-estate firm owned by Jared Kushner.) Despite the news, rent was still due on April 1st for most American renters, and nearly a third of them couldn’t pay. More were expected to fall off the books for May.

“I have seven hundred and seventy-three dollars in my bank account,” Winsome Pendergrass, a Jamaican-born domestic worker, said at the end of last month. “My rent is nine hundred and fifty-eight dollars and sixty-five cents. I paid in April, but now I can’t. I call it Can’t-Pay May.”

Pendergrass, who is sixty-two, sat on a sofa in the two-and-a-half-bedroom apartment in Brownsville that she shares with her daughter, her granddaughter, and a lot of plants. She is trying to turn missed rent payments into a movement. She belongs to New York Communities for Change, a group that has organized a rent strike among its five thousand members. “We try to encourage our members: Have a conversation with your landlord,” she said. “But many landlords are pushing papers under their doors saying, ‘Your responsibility is to pay.’ ”

New York State has banned evictions until mid-June, and a bill proposed in the City Council seeks to extend the grace period to April, 2021, in the five boroughs, but renters will have to make up missed payments. Pendergrass and her group have called on Trump and Governor Andrew Cuomo to cancel rents and mortgages permanently for the duration of the stay-at-home order.

Pendergrass was getting ready for a rent-strike meeting, held on Zoom, for renters across the city. She wore red lipstick and earrings in the shape of leaves. Around dinnertime, video feeds started popping up on her screen. Fifty-eight people attended the last meeting. This time, there were a hundred and eighty-eight.

People shared their stories. Peggy Perkins (1 BR, $1,336, Hempstead, mold problems) said she’d been homeless, with three children, before finally finding financial stability. She’d just registered a name for a beauty parlor she planned to open: Luxurious LaBelle Hair and Spa. She was applying for a loan when the coronavirus hit. No more haircuts, no more income. She tried talking to her landlord, but he wouldn’t negotiate. (He said he needs the money to pay his employees, such as the building’s superintendent.)

Another woman, Donnette (1½ BR, $1,700, Canarsie), had been working as a home health aide but lost her job on April 12th, when her client, who was ninety-eight, died from the virus. Donnette stayed with the woman at her nursing home, because her family wasn’t allowed in. “I refused to leave her,” she said. “It was a choice. It was no longer employment, but it was duty.” Donnette said she could get by for a few months, if she zeroed out her savings. She didn’t expect to receive a stimulus check, because she is an undocumented immigrant, from Jamaica. “I’m trying to do the math, and I can’t make sense of it,” she said.

“She’s not a lazy person,” Pendergrass said of Donnette, after the meeting. “As they say, a Jamaican’s always got three jobs. And is going to school. But the hammer is over her head.” Pendergrass is now a U.S. citizen. She thought her own three-job days were over, but she figures that, without assistance, she’ll have to start working extended hours, seven days a week, to keep her apartment. Recently, she called her life-insurance company to ask about taking money out.

A man in an oversized gray shirt began to speak. He was nervous about the strike. “All the people I know are very scared,” he said, in Spanish. “We’re not going to pay rent for two or three months? O.K., that’s fine, but what about after? We’re going to be in debt.”

Pendergrass jumped in. If they couldn’t pay, she said, they were better off not paying together. “We are just forcing Albany to address renters,” she said. “We are the sufferers.”

People kept talking and listening, and, inside their little Zoom squares, they went about their evening routines. A woman fried tortillas. A man wearing a gold chain hugged a Teddy bear. A woman brushed a girl’s hair. On the walls were portraits of Jesus, graduation photos, and finger paintings. The sun went down and lamps turned on. The apartments were neat and messy and nice and dingy, but they were all, for the moment, home. ♦

"['The Editors', 'The Editor']",2020-05-05,"Pam McCarthy, Champion of Change","Of the many things that we’ve missed in these bewildering weeks of homebound distancing, one is the ability to mark properly the joyful passages of life: births, graduations, weddings, anniversaries. A FaceTime toast or a Zoom-ed congratulations hardly feels sufficient, but, for now, in-person festivities must be deferred for safer, sunnier days. Here at The New Yorker, we had plans to celebrate the astonishing career of our dear friend and colleague Pamela Maffei McCarthy, who has been the magazine’s deputy editor since 1995, and who decided not long ago that the time had come to spend her days doing something new. It wasn’t easy for any of us to accept this news—no one is more respected or adored at One World Trade Center. And yet no one is more deserving of a next chapter. This is Pam’s last issue, and, while we’re keeping the champagne on ice for a little longer, we want to thank and celebrate her here.

In the earliest years of The New Yorker, Harold Ross, its founding editor, always said he was looking for a “Jesus”—someone who could keep his venture calm and steady, fending off crisis, bringing the good news. He never quite found that savior. In Pam McCarthy, The New Yorker finally got what Ross was searching for: here was someone who would find, shepherd, and protect every variety of talent, a diplomat who could quiet troubled waters, a businessperson who could multiply loaves and fishes. In no small measure, today’s New Yorker would not exist without her and the extraordinary people she found, put into place, and promoted. The building started the moment she arrived; now she leaves the magazine transformed, expanded, and healthy. She did it not only with editorial acuity and business savvy but with immense depth of character, kindness, and generosity.

Pam McCarthy started her career at Esquire, where, first as a proofreader and later as executive editor, she learned every skill that magazines demand, on and off the page. She learned how to make things sing and how to make things run. As Tina Brown’s managing editor at Vanity Fair, she became an essential figure in that title’s rebirth and flourishing. In “The Vanity Fair Diaries: 1983-1992,” Brown describes her as “miraculous,” arriving on the scene and, in no time at all, taking everything in hand: editorial debates, fact-checking disputes, restive egos, production snarls, budgetary headaches, legal quandaries.

When Brown succeeded Robert Gottlieb as the editor of The New Yorker, she brought Pam with her to help revitalize its pages with new writers and artists. The New Yorker entered the modern age gradually––and then, it seemed, all at once, adding a Web site, then a fuller Web site, podcasts, video, newsletters, a radio show. At each step, Pam championed change while making sure that our editorial soul remained true and our business prospects solid. And, even as she shouldered the countless details required to make The New Yorker sail straight, Pam, often on weekends, provided other editors with editorial counsel. Invariably, her suggestions were about fairness, discipline, and tone. She has deep confidence in the power of facts, and she is wary of the cheap shot, the flash of hyperbole, the rickety insinuation. “She protected our business—and that was a huge thing,” as one of us put it. “But her editorial protection was the thing I valued the most.”

Pam McCarthy made sure that we could achieve our greatest ambitions while managing to be a fair-minded, decent, and financially sustainable workplace. Filling a role that once seemed impossible, she has proved one of the most important and influential people to walk through the doors of The New Yorker since the place opened, in midtown, ninety-five years ago. We’ve long ceased to marvel at her ability to create calm from the stuff of crisis. Working miracles, as Ross knew, was always part of the job description. ♦",newyorker,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/11/pam-mccarthy-champion-of-change

"['Helen Rosner', 'Helen Rosne']",2020-05-05,The Chefs Behind Contra and Wildair Reincarnate,"The other day, at around 6:45 p.m., an iPad lit up at Contrair, perhaps New York’s only brand-new restaurant. On it was takeout order 63627: one jerk chicken, one crab congee, one lamb birria. Contrair is run by Jeremiah Stone and Fabián von Hauske Valtierra, the chefs behind the Lower East Side tasting-menu spot Contra and Wildair, a natural-wine bar next door—well-loved restaurants that nail that rare hat trick of being impeccably cool, winningly laid-back, and culinarily thrilling. But at the beginning of April, with their dining rooms closed because of the coronavirus, and artful small plates far from people’s minds, Stone and von Hauske Valtierra decided that their gastronomic future lay, at least temporarily, in stews, grills, and braises, packaged to go. (Contrair’s portmanteau name doubles as a punning bit of gallows humor: “You might ask ‘Are you guys closed?’ ” Stone said, “and we can be, like, ‘Au Contrair! ’ ”)

Countless restaurants in New York have shifted, of late, to takeout and delivery, and many have changed their menus—but few have taken on entirely new identities. To Stone and von Hauske Valtierra, reincarnating as Contrair was an aesthetic decision as much as a practical one. “I ordered some takeout from a place that’s quite expensive, and it just looked sad,” Stone said. Rustic cooking travels better, he found. He ran a quality-control experiment, sending deliveries to friends (and to von Hauske Valtierra, who had spent the early weeks of the social-distancing era housebound with bronchitis); he’d take a “before” photo, and ask them to send him an “after.”

The worldly menu includes, from left to right, jerk chicken, azimuth tabouli, miso kale salad with grilled beets, golden-crab congee, and rice pudding. Photograph by Haruka Sakaguchi for The New Yorker

In the morning, four days a week, Stone and von Hauske Valtierra prep lunches for medical workers; in the afternoon, they turn their attention to Contrair. For order 63627, Stone placed a chicken leg—which had cured in salt for a day, then marinated in jerk spices for another—on the grill, where its skin would become crisp and dark around the sweet, smoky meat; it would be plated in a compostable clamshell with collards, squash, and pigeon peas. Another cook filled a paper bowl with rice, purple cabbage, chickpeas, cilantro, and thin slices of red onion, an eventual home for the velvet-tender lamb birria (which arrives separately, in its dark, savory broth), then filled a quart container with golden ladlefuls of congee, packed alongside fried wonton wrappers tossed with Old Bay seasoning.

Even in the best of times, restaurants run on razor-thin margins; right now, between revenue from Contrair and income from their hospital contract (paid for, philanthropically, by Verizon), Stone and von Hauske Valtierra barely break even. “We’re not squandering any resources,” Stone said. “André Soltner told me that if you crack twelve eggs, the amount you leave behind is basically an extra egg, so you should do this”—he swiped his thumb inside each cracked shell, scooping out any lingering whites. Rice left over from the previous day’s birria is repurposed for the congee; scallion ends, scraps from making congee, are charred and added to the marinade for the next day’s birria.

By 7:10, order 63627 was neatly bundled, the food packaged up with a rum cocktail of Stone’s invention, made with beet syrup and orange bitters; two bottles of wine (like many desperate restaurants, they’re selling off their cellar at near-cost prices); and two of von Hauske Valtierra’s marvellous dirt cups, cloudlike hazelnut pudding layered with praline and chocolate, garnished jauntily with Haribo gummies purchased from the still open bodega down the block.

At 7:15, a customer arrived to pick up her order. She stepped just inside the front door of the erstwhile Contra dining room, where three tables had been repurposed as a makeshift barricade. A wireless doorbell cued a staffer to slide the bagged order across the polished wood. Outside, Orchard Street was gloomy with evening shadows; the sidewalks, usually crowded with bons vivants waiting for tables, were empty. As she left, the customer sent brief arcs of light and snippets of sound onto the street. Then everything was quiet and dark again. (Entrées $14-$19.) ♦

Percent infected by 25 50 75% No control measures Some control measures Severe control measures Three scenarios for how the outbreak could spread. Percent infected by 25 50 75%

The coronavirus has infected far more people in the United States than testing has shown so far, and stringent measures to limit social contact in parts of the country not yet seeing many cases are needed to significantly stem the tide of illness and death in the coming months.

Those are the conclusions of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve based on what is known about the virus. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as America adopts unprecedented measures to control the outbreak.

But they offer a stark warning: Even if the country cut its rate of transmission in half — a tall order — some 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.

The growth is driven by Americans with mild symptoms who are carrying and spreading the virus without being aware that they have it, the researchers say. The number of undetected cases — 11 times more than has been officially reported, they estimate — reflects how far behind the United States has fallen in testing for the virus.

New York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary measures over the past week, the researchers say. New York City’s outbreak, the nation’s largest, grew to more than 4,000 known cases on Friday and is likely to increase many times over even in a favorable scenario.

On the other hand, parts of the country without large clusters of cases could still avoid the worst of the outbreak — if they impose measures like closing schools, banning mass gatherings and testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts. The epidemic would then spread inland at a much slower pace and strike with less severity, the estimates say.

But controls would need to be put in place immediately, and everywhere.

“We’re looking at something that’s catastrophic on a level that we have not seen for an infectious disease since 1918,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and the leader of the research team, referring to the Spanish flu. “And it’s requiring sacrifices we haven’t seen since World War II. There are going to be enormous disruptions. There’s no easy way out.”

Controls in many places have already changed the fabric of American life. Restaurants and schools have closed, people are working from home and travelers have put off trips — all changes that should reduce the rate of infection. In California, New York and Illinois, officials have announced more stringent directives aimed at stopping the spread. That means that at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home in the coming days, and more states are expected to follow suit.

But other places have resisted. Bars and restaurants remain open in Wichita, Kan., in a county that reported its first case on Thursday night, and in Knoxville, Tenn., where reports of the virus have been scarce. Some malls remain open in Chicago, recreational marijuana shops in Oregon, and some retail chains nationwide. Many businesses are still requiring workers to come into the office.

“I’m not really supportive yet of restricting things further or closing down,” said Pete Meitzner, head of the Board of County Commissioners in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, a city of about 400,000. Mr. Meitzner said he was growing increasingly anxious at the possibility that people who do not know they are ill might spread the virus, but that he also needed to consider the fate of workers as the community decided whether to close buildings.

“Some of our public offices and buildings are, but I do feel horrible for our restaurant workers and our hospitality workers at our hotels,” he said. “They are really suffering.”

Of the area’s relative dearth of cases, Mr. Meitzner added, “We don’t know for sure if we’re lucky or what.”

The scenarios do not estimate what effect individual local actions will have on the outbreak. But if the country as a whole does not take collective action, they suggest that Sedgwick County could see a significant proportion of its population — hundreds of thousands of people — infected with the virus in the next two months. If the country, as a whole, can reduce rates of transmission by 50 percent, Sedgwick County could instead see fewer than 1,000 cases in that time.

The rate of new infections varies by state New cases per capita by day, sorted by peak time By The New York Times · Source: Sen Pei and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University

Several researchers not involved in the Columbia University analysis who reviewed the findings said they made sense and broadly agreed with their own thinking. Even in places that now appear to have few cases, they said, officials should act sooner rather than later.

“You have to think of this as an insurance for the future: The earlier you do it, the greater effect you have on the virus,” said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, who said the estimates were in line with his own projections. “It’s better to take excessive precautions than not.”

The economic challenges of that loom.

“We’re staying open until someone forces us to shut down,” Beau McKee, the general manager at Not Watson’s Kitchen and Bar in Knoxville, said in a telephone interview, as dishes clattered in the background. “I feel like those people that are vulnerable know who they are and they should be careful, and we should continue testing. But small businesses are getting crushed.”

Mr. McKee said he has grown increasingly worried about how the virus could affect his own father, in his 70s, but that there were other worries too. “At least we can offer a handful of people good-paying jobs and when we get out of this and we’re on the other side, we’ll hopefully have gained more clientele by doing so because we kind of stuck it out and didn’t wave the white flag,” he said.

The Columbia researchers’ model works by observing the behavior of the outbreak in the United States up until March 13, based on case records compiled by The New York Times, commuting patterns and other data.

The researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2. Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found.

Those factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread.

The estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with the available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise impact of unprecedented measures that America has already put in place to control the outbreak.

But the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.

A worst-case scenario is unlikely to play out. A handful of countries, including China and South Korea, have managed to slow down their own fast-moving outbreaks through tracking and isolating sick people and reducing social contact. It is not known if measures imposed in the last week have started slowing the outbreak in the United States.

But the researchers’ estimates show the enormity of the task. As in China, most of those who have been infected but not tested are likely to have mild symptoms, or none at all, the researchers say. That means they can spread the virus without being aware they are infected.

Several researchers said that the slow pace of testing in the United States is one major reason the proportion of unreported infections is so high here. Despite a ramping up of testing in recent days, the United States still lags both Italy and South Korea in the total number of people tested and in testing per-capita, figures show.

This map shows how many people the model estimates could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now.

One scenario — which is unlikely — simulates what could happen without any intervention. A second scenario envisions what would happen with some control measures, such as partial adherance to social distancing guidlines and a patchwork of government-imposed restrictions on work, travel, and dining out. A third envisions severe control measures: strict adherance across the country to social distancing, working remotely, closing schools and restaurants and banning large gatherings.

Three scenarios for each county These are rough estimates of how the virus could spread, but they are inherently uncertain, especially many months in the future.

New York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Dr. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates.

“This is serious and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive,” Dr. Vespignani said. “We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them.”

In the days since New York’s first recorded case, on March 1, the state has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to New Rochelle, an early focal point of the outbreak; New York City has closed schools and barred dining in at restaurants and watching Broadway shows.

But in places like Wichita, some parts of life have yet to change. In that city, bars and restaurants are allowed to operate freely as long as they keep crowds to fewer than 50 people.

Still, Beverly Salas, an owner of Egg Cetera, a downtown restaurant that serves brunch and late-night bites for the bar crowd, said she chose to close the restaurant anyway. “It was a hard decision, honestly, because we have no more income coming in,” Ms. Salas, 24, said. But her customers include nurses from a nearby hospital and many people who are in their 60s or older, she said, and the thought that someone might somehow contract the illness at her small restaurant was too much for her to bear.

“I’m looking at other places like Italy and trying to avoid going through that,” she said. “Why are we not taking it as seriously as New York, Chicago, or even Kansas City?

It’s not about smiling when you don’t feel like it. Optimism is simply being hopeful about the future, even when the present feels wholly negative. Cognitively, this is a challenge, because it requires you to acknowledge your positive and negative emotions at once and to allow them to exist simultaneously. As hard as it may be to make the case for optimism during a time of crisis, that’s when it happens to be the most useful.",nytimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/smarter-living/coronavirus-how-to-stay-optimistic-.html

While there, I kept hearing about a young doctor with Covid who was fighting for his life in the ICU. Things just were not getting better. The amount of anger and frustration and sadness that I felt. Just the idea of losing my son was unbearable. But ultimately, he survived. I’m Andres Maldonado, and I’m an ER doctor here in the Bronx. I’m a healthy 27-year-old guy. No medical problems. But I got Covid-19. I was so sick that, at one point, I thought I was going to die. This is my story, which should be a warning to everyone. I was working mostly in the two weeks where it was really starting to ramp up. It was quite dire. Stretchers lined two or three deep. You were just being called from one patient to the next. “I need a vent.” “I need a vent.” How many vents do we have? All these questions that we had never considered, ever. They’re starting to ration out these N95s. We’re in a spot where we’re wearing stuff a day at a time, multiple days at a time. A lot of these patients that I’ve met are scared. I want to be able to help people when they need you the most. There was a patient, and she coughed right on my face. And that’s when I got scared. What if she does have coronavirus? Day one, March 23rd. It was the middle of the night. I started to feel just really horrible chills. But I thought to myself, oh, you know, I’ve been sick like this before. You know, I’ve had a virus. I’m young. I’m 27. I’m invincible. Like, you know, nothing can touch me. Day two. When I would take a really deep breath, it would hurt. Day three. Fevers that would come up to 102. But I would take Tylenol, and I’d be OK. Day four. I spoke to my mom. Through the whole week, it was like, what’s going to happen, what’s going to happen? Day five was actually when I went to go get tested. Day six, and my coronavirus is positive. Our worst fears were coming true. Day seven. I was pacing my room, and I was just thinking, come on, Tylenol, just start working already. It worked a little bit, but then the fever would come back two hours later. Day eight. Couldn’t finish my sentences without taking a breath. That’s when it clicked, I can’t continue to stay home. Day nine, March 31st. Andres calls me, and he tells me, the first thing is, ‘Mommy, don’t panic.’ And when he says don’t panic, what do you think I’m going to do? And he goes, ‘I’m going to the ER right now. I don’t feel good.’ And I said, ‘what’s wrong?’ And he said, ‘I’m short of breath.’ I met Mike Jones, our leader in residency, inside of a tent in front of the ER. He came to the hospital where I was that day. Every patient with COVID reaches a critical time period where you can see that they’re heading in the wrong direction. They’re kind of going over that tilt of that cliff, heading in the direction where they may need intubation. At least 70% to 80% of patients who were placed on ventilators were dying. So we tried very hard to avoid intubation. Everyone who was there knew me. All the nurses, Mike Jones. I know Dr. Romo personally. They were alarmed. Just looking at him through the window, it just felt like I got kicked in the stomach. I ended up writing ‘we love you’ and taping it on the window so he could see it. I went in the room and I cried. I cried. I wanted to remain strong and support Andres, and not let him see that I was worried. I was terrified. When I walk into the room, I realize that he was breathing at a faster rate than he was before. That was a significant moment for me because I have been in that position where you see a patient, they were critically ill. I knew that sense of urgency meant that they were considering more invasive options. We decided that he was getting sicker, and that maybe he was going to need to be intubated. We made the decision to admit him to the intensive care unit. I said, ‘call the ICU right now. Let them know he’s coming.’ I heard Dr. Romo say he needs to be placed on a high-flow nasal cannula. A device that provides a large volume and high velocity of oxygen to a patient. So we brought him right up and started the high-flow nasal cannula. The only thought in my head was, just please get better on this. Please, please work. I woke up in the middle of the night. I heard a lot of commotion outside, and people turned on all the lights. I looked at the monitor to check my vital signs, and overhead, you hear— “Rapid response. Rapid response.” They’re calling for extra doctors to report two rooms down from me. She was a 25-year-old. She just kept saying, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.’ Then she had this cardiac arrest. Her heart stopped. And I was terrified. You know, I was thinking, that’s two doors down, and that could have been me. Sometimes, you think about what would happen if you would die. And then you think about your parents if you died, the permanent distress they’d probably feel. And I haven’t really seen my husband cry, and he did break down. I have never seen him like that. He went on his knees, and he was asking God to please save Andres and take him instead of Andres. My dad doesn’t get like that. You know, he’s serious. He’s like a military guy. Just let me get over this. Just the idea of losing my son was unbearable. Despite thinking I can die, I still felt determined to somehow get better. And the way that translated to me and my medical mind was focus on your breathing. One breath at a time. Think about the air going in, out. Try and take deep breaths. Makes you cough? OK., take a break. Try again. And then at some magical point, we turned the corner. What’s up, Andres? Welcome back. Hey, thank you. Wow. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] (CHANTING) Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! Andres! I’m completely overwhelmed right now. It’s a victory. Every victory helps us try to help the next patient get through this. It was an amazing feeling of triumph. It was like, yes, we did this, we beat it. They saved my life. 24 of our 84 emergency medicine residents have been out sick during this crisis. The number of health care workers that have died is horrible. All health care worker infections are preventable. I really, truly believe that. I believe the government failed everybody. Oh, only 400 died today, not 700 like last week. It’s like, for goodness sake, we’re talking about human lives. It’s a virus. It will infect you. It doesn’t care who you are, where you’re from, what you do, who you support politically. It just doesn’t care.

['David Smith'],2020-05-05,"Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000","Pence says federal agencies could take over response in coming weeks as Trump acknowledges ‘some people will be affected badly’

Donald Trump is preparing to wind down the White House coronavirus taskforce even as the US death toll has topped 70,000 and experts warn that the worst is yet to come.

Mike Pence, the vice-president and taskforce chair, said on Tuesday that coordination of the pandemic response could be transferred back to federal agencies in late May or early June.

But in the wake of a leaked internal White House report suggesting that the daily US death toll will climb to 3,000 per day by June, the move is likely to fuel concerns that Trump has all but abandoned a public health strategy in favour of economic imperatives.

“I’m not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,” Trump said during a trip to Arizona – a battleground state in the 2020 presidential election – on Tuesday. “But we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.”

In an interview with David Muir of ABC News on Tuesday evening, Trump was asked directly: “Do you believe it’s the reality we’re facing, that lives will be lost to reopen the country?”

The president said: “It’s possible there will be some because you won’t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is, but at the same time we’re going to practise social distancing, we’re going to be washing hands, we’re going to be doing a lot of the things that we’ve learned to do over the last period of time. And we have to get our country back.”

A prolonged shutdown, Trump added, came with its own costs in terms of increased drug use and suicide.

Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate, tweeted: “It appears the plan is, shamefully, to have no plan. Americans will suffer. We must replace this administration in November.”

David Axelrod, former chief strategist for Barack Obama, added on Twitter: “If you can’t shut down the virus, shut down the taskforce.”

Pence was responding on Tuesday to questions about a New York Times report that said officials in the Trump administration were telling the 22 taskforce members and their staff to expect the group to be phased out within weeks.

“I think we’re starting to look at the Memorial Day [25 May] window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner,” the vice-president said, according to a pool report.

Pence insisted that “it really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country” and promised to keep the response coordinator, Deborah Birx, “around every bit as long as we need to”.

Birx herself said: “We’ll still keep a close eye on the data because we have very good data now. It took us a while to build that capacity. And we’ll make sure that, you know, we’re watching that at a federal level.”

But there was also immediate confusion. Even as Pence spoke, Anthony Fauci, a leading taskforce member, was denying the Times’s report. “That’s not true,” the infectious disease expert told CBS News. “I’ve been in every taskforce meeting, and that’s not what they are doing.”

The taskforce was created in late January and Pence was named as chairman in late February. It met frequently to address the rapidly spreading pandemic and then explained its work in nightly press briefings dominated by Trump that sometimes lasted more than two hours.

But the president was accused of using the platform to score political points, with Republican allies eventually warning that the briefings were damaging him at the polls.

After a briefing in which Trump floated the idea of treating the virus with disinfectant injections, the events were soon killed off. There has now been no briefing for more than a week and the taskforce is meeting less frequently.

Its demise would be the latest sign that the White House is pivoting towards the first phase of Trump’s plan to reopen the country after many states ordered people to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus. The president has urged supporters to “liberate” states from pandemic restrictions and signalled approval for armed protesters who have defied his own social distancing guidelines.

On Sunday, Trump held a Fox News virtual town hall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and was joined by Pence and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, putting an emphasis on the economy.

Laura Ingraham, a Fox News host whom Trump follows closely, applauded the winding up of the taskforce. “For too long it seemed like unelected doctors were making policy,” she tweeted. “Economic toll was disastrous.”

Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, denied that health concerns were being neglected: “Reporting on the task force is being misconstrued to suggest the White House is no longer involving medical experts,” she tweeted. “This is totally false. President Trump will continue his data-driven approach towards safely re-opening.”

But to critics, the timing is awry. On Monday, researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation almost doubled its previous US mortality model to more than 134,000 from 72,400 on 29 April. The change reflected “rising mobility in most US states” with an easing of business closures and stay-at-home orders expected in 31 states by 11 May, the institute said.

Fauci warned in a CNN interview on Monday that there would be a “rebound” of new coronavirus cases in the US if the country rushes towards a “premature” reopening of society and business. “How many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be some form of normality sooner rather than later?” he asked.

Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said any attempt to sideline Birx and Fauci was doomed. “He might try to marginalise them but the press isn’t going to try to marginalise them.

“They are the people with the data and with the expertise and nobody with data and expertise is going to be marginalised. It’s going to be the politicians who don’t listen to the scientists who are going to get marginalised.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/trump-coronavirus-taskforce-pence-us-death-toll

Donald Trump used his first cross-country trip since the pandemic began to visit an Arizona plant manufacturing medical masks, seeking to demonstrate America’s readiness to reopen the economy even as public health experts warned it was too soon.

His visit to the battleground state on Tuesday came as the White House signalled a desire to wind down the coronavirus taskforce in the coming weeks despite a continued threat from the virus.

“I’m not saying anything is perfect,” Trump told reporters in Arizona. “Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.”

During a tour of the Honeywell facility in Phoenix, which shifted from manufacturing aircraft engines to producing N95 respirator masks in response to the pandemic, Trump wore safety glasses but no mask. A sign at the entrance urged visitors to wear masks at all times, but a White House official said the company had informed them in advance that a mask was not required.

The visit is meant to underscore the administration’s efforts to nudge a cautious nation, still grappling with economic and public health disasters inflicted by the virus, to return to a more normal way of life. Trump has cheered moves by some governors to reopen their economies, despite a failure to meet guidelines for lifting safety restrictions issued by the White House and concern from public health officials that states are acting too quickly.

Despite Trump’s optimism, wide majorities of Americans oppose the reopening of businesses and restaurants. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll published on Tuesday found that 74% of Americans said they were opposed to reopening dine-in restaurants and nail salons in their states, while more than eight in 10 Americans said movie theaters should not be allowed to reopen in their states.

In Arizona, Trump praised the “phenomenal” work of the coronavirus taskforce, led by the vice-president, Mike Pence, but said it was time to focus on the next “phase”.

Trump was greeted on the tarmac in Phoenix by Arizona’s governor, Doug Ducey, a Republican who has been more cautious than some fellow GOP governors about reopening the state. This week he extended the state’s stay-at-home-order until 15 May with exceptions allowing salons, barbershops, businesses and restaurants to open in the coming days if they meet certain safety conditions.

While the number of infections in Arizona is declining, the Navajo Nation that crosses the northern part of the state remains one of the worst-affected areas in the country. As of Monday, 2,474 residents of the Navajo Nation have tested positive and 73 have died.

Before Trump’s visit, the treasury department announced that it would begin distributing $4.8bn in coronavirus relief allocated for Native American tribes, aid the tribal governments had to sue to obtain. Trump pledged $600m to help the Navajo Nation fight the pandemic during a roundtable with tribal leaders.

Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, said Trump had worsened the public health crisis by refusing to reopen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act amid the pandemic, which Ducey recommended.

“President Trump will try to paper over his administration’s failed response to the Covid-19 pandemic when he travels today to Arizona,” he said in a statement, “but nothing can cover up how he failed to prepare our country for this pandemic and his slow response.”

A political battleground in Arizona

Some of Trump’s most raucous rallies have been in Arizona, where he has a devoted base. But he has also alienated the state’s independent and moderate voters, while a growing Hispanic electorate and newcomers from states like California and Washington have also accelerated the state’s political diversity.

In 2016, he won the state by 3.5 percentage points, a much smaller margin than past Republican presidential candidates. Two years later, the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema beat Martha McSally in a Senate race to succeed the retiring Arizona senator Jeff Flake. McSally was then appointed to fill the seat of the late Arizona senator John McCain, and she is now locked in a fierce contest with the Democrat Mark Kelly to retain it.

The seat has been held by a Republican since Barry Goldwater was first elected to the Senate in 1968. But the race is now considered a “toss-up” by the non-partisan Cook Political report and recent polling shows McSally trailing Kelly.

“This year really could be a tipping point for Arizona politics,” said Chip Scutari, a political consultant in Phoenix. “And I’m sure President Trump and his team want to solidify Arizona in the win column but it’s really up for grabs.”

Scutari called Trump’s visit a “pseudo-campaign rally”; indeed, when the president finished speaking at the Honeywell facility the Rolling Stones’s You Can’t Always Get What You Want – a Trump rally staple – began to play.

Democrats are increasingly bullish on their prospects, buoyed by polls that show Biden leading in the state.

Felecia Rotellini, the chair of the Arizona Democratic party, called Trump’s visit to the state a “sign of desperation”.

“The Covid-19 crisis and the complete lack of empathy and competence that the president has shown in his handling of this has created even a greater sinking ship that is now called his re-election campaign,” Rotellini said.

The brief trip to Phoenix marks the beginning of what Trump hopes will be more frequent outings after being locked down in Washington for weeks, and as polling numbers show his support eroding in battleground states. The president has said he plans to travel soon to Ohio, New York and North Dakota for a Fourth of July fireworks display at Mount Rushmore. Though eager to get back on the campaign trail, Trump acknowledged in a town hall with Fox News on Sunday that his signature rallies were unlikely to return for several more months, at least.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-arizona-coronavirus-reopening

The Trump administration is poised to break up the White House coronavirus taskforce, the public face of the US response to the virus, even as experts warn that the worst is yet to come.

Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000 Read more

Here is what we know so far about the taskforce and where the US stands in its response to Covid-19.

What is the coronavirus taskforce?

Days after public health officials announced the first confirmed case of Covid-19 on US soil on 21 January, the White House announced that it had formed a taskforce that would lead the federal government’s response to the pandemic. The group, it said, would work together to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus in the US and keep the public informed about important public health and travel guidance.

By March, as the US reported thousands of new cases of Covid-19 every day, the taskforce gave daily press briefings, ostensibly to update Americans about the public health emergency.

But at the end of April, the briefings stopped. The last press conference was held on 24 April. According to reports, Trump’s advisers said his daily appearances were hurting his chance of re-election in November, especially after he suggested – with no evidence – that disinfectant could fight the virus in human bodies.

Who is on the taskforce?

Headed by Mike Pence, the taskforce is made up of members of Trump’s cabinet, including Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, and Steve Mnuchin, secretary of the treasury. There are also representatives from different departments, such as transportation and defense, and various advisers to the president.

Trump appointed two well-respected epidemiologists, Drs Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, to the taskforce. Both, though especially Fauci, have been widely regarded as the sober voices centered on public health, in contrast with the political figures on the taskforce.

What effect is Covid-19 having on public health in the US?

Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and released on Tuesday showed that the number of coronavirus deaths in the US had passed 70,000 – far more than any other country, and over a quarter of all coronavirus deaths in the world. As of Tuesday afternoon, the US had nearly 1.2m confirmed cases, one-third of the worldwide total.

The virus has had a devastating effect in communities across the US as hospital systems have become overwhelmed and struggled to get proper protective equipment and ventilators to help patients with the most serious cases.

A report thought to be from the White House (though the White House has denied ownership) said daily coronavirus deaths could reach 3,000 in the US by 1 June. The US is currently seeing between 1,000 and 2,000 deaths and between 20,000 and 30,000 new cases a day.

What effect has Covid-19 had on the US economy?

A majority of states issued stay-at-home orders, allowing only essential workers to go to work and keep their businesses open. This has resulted in a wave of unemployment throughout the US: more than 22 million people have filed for unemployment since the crisis began, a number likely to rise as states work through the backlog of applications.

Industries such as restaurants and travel have been decimated by shutdown orders with uncertainty over when, if ever, business will return to normal. Congress has passed a series of spending bills, the main one being a $2.2tn stimulus package in March, to try to mitigate the harm the virus has had on industries, hospitals and local governments.

As the economic fallout worsened, Trump has encouraged states to reopen, insisting that it is safe while also acknowledging the death toll is set to rise. Twenty-three states are beginning to reopen despite the warnings of the risks to public safety.

Meanwhile critics have accused Trump of effectively abandoning a public health strategy for the pandemic and showing “clear willingness to trade lives for the Dow Jones”.

Why is the White House ending the coronavirus taskforce?

Pence insisted that “it really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country”, despite data on the continuing public health risk.

Recently there has been some tension in messaging about the virus from key members of the group.

Fauci has cautioned that the US needs to have enough testing capacity to reopen safely, and is not yet at that stage. Fauci said the US will need to double its current level of testing within several weeks.

“I don’t think there’s a chance that this virus is just going to disappear,” he told National Geographic. “It’s going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge.”

But acknowledging that the US is still behind on testing does not chime with Trump’s messaging.

A leaked internal White House report predicts the daily death toll from the virus will reach about 3,000 on 1 June, almost double the current tally of about 1,750, the New York Times revealed on Monday.

Yet at the same time, Trump has scrapped daily coronavirus task force briefings and marginalized his medical experts in favour of economic officials flooding the airwaves to urge states to reopen for business – even amid rising infection rates.

On Tuesday morning, before boarding Air Force One to visit a medical mask-making facility in Arizona for his first long trip since late March when the outbreak escalated in the US, Trump weighed a predicted surge in deaths against economic revival.

“There is no great win, one way or the other, but I will tell you where there is a win, we are going to build a country, I did it once, two months ago we had the best economy in the history of the world, but we are going to do it again and that’s what we’re starting … it’s going to happen pretty fast.”

The top US public health expert on the White House coronavirus task force, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in a CNN interview the previous evening that there will be a “rebound” of new coronavirus cases in the US if the country rushes towards a “premature” reopening of society and business.

“How many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be some form of normality sooner rather than later?” he asked.

And on Tuesday morning New York governor Andrew Cuomo warned against what he called a life or death “trade-off” when planning how and when to lift restrictions.

“The faster we reopen the lower the economic costs, but the higher the human costs because the more lives lost. That, my friends, is the decision we are really making,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing.

Critics are now sharply questioning the Trump administration approach to what Fauci called “a very difficult choice” that weighs a death toll against economic catastrophe.

“They’ve decided in a very utilitarian kind of way that the political damage from a collapsed economy is greater than the political damage from losing as many as 90,000 more Americans just in June,” said Rick Wilson, a former Republican strategist. “We’re witnessing the full-scale application of a kind of grisly realpolitik that is a clear willingness to trade lives for the Dow Jones.”

In a sign of the shift, the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie told CNN that increased deaths could be worth it if the economy reopens. “Of course, everybody wants to save every life they can – but the question is, towards what end, ultimately?” said Christie, a Republican who led Donald Trump’s presidential transition team in 2016. He added: “Are there ways that we can … thread the needle here to allow that there are going to be deaths, and there are going to be deaths no matter what?”

When Trump declared a national emergency on 13 March, hopes rose that, for all the early downplaying and missed testing opportunities, the federal government was finally ready to attack the crisis with full force.

Trump quickly branded himself a “wartime president” and, on 31 March, somberly braced Americans for a “very, very painful two weeks” ahead. His daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefings earned comparisons with campaign rallies, sometimes running for more than two hours, but also featured respected experts, Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, armed with graphics and science.

On 23 April, however, Trump pontificated about injecting disinfectant into coronavirus patients, prompting worldwide disbelief and derision. The briefings would never be the same again and over the past week have been replaced by set-piece events touting an economic comeback.

On Sunday, tellingly, when Trump held a Fox News virtual town hall entitled “America Together: Returning to Work” at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, he was accompanied not by Birx and Fauci but Vice-President Mike Pence and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.

The president has been egged on by Fox News hosts who question whether the virus is any worse than the common flu, doubt the value of physical distancing and contend that the economic shutdown, which has cost at least 30m jobs, shows the cure is worse than the problem.

On Saturday, a Washington Post report suggested Trump had been encouraged to pivot from the health crisis to the economic fightback by an internal White House analysis that suggested the daily death toll would peak in mid-April then fall away significantly. His “decision-making has been guided largely by his re-election prospects”, the Post added.

But death toll predictions from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a model favored by the White House, were raised on Monday from 72,000 to 134,000 by the start of August because, it said, states are relaxing physical distancing too soon.

Now, critics say, Trump seems ready to shrug at the losses as collateral damage, paying greater heed to his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, than Birx or Fauci.

Wilson, author of Everything Trump Touches Dies, warned: “They may end up making the situation so bad with a second wave in the summer and a third wave in the fall that we end up with a much worse set of economic challenges than if we’d taken our bitter medicine and stayed shut down until we were through the early part of this crisis.”

The grim news remains inescapable but the administration hopes its economic message will offer at least some counter-programming.

Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, said: “Almost by necessity, they are changing their strategy. They are pinning all of their hopes on getting the economy reopened, using their economic spokespeople and hoping that the American public has a high toleration for the death count moving up. It sounds terrible to say and even worse to do.

“I think you won’t be seeing much from the scientists any more – the news is that bad – and they’re just going to turn a blind eye to the fact that what they’re doing is going to kill more people, because ultimately the way the president makes decisions is what’s good for his re-election.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-economic-recovery

Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, a thinktank warns.

['Michael Sainato'],2020-05-05,"Amazon is cracking down on protesters and organizing, workers say","Amazon’s revenues topped $33m an hour in the first three months of the year as the coronavirus pandemic locked down large parts of the world. The sales boost has handed Amazon the biggest dilemma of its 25-year life: how to deal with a growing chorus of critics within the company. So far its reaction has only made matters worse.

Last week an Amazon vice-president, Tim Bray, resigned in protest at what he called the company’s “chickenshit” decision to fire colleagues in the company’s warehouse division who had highlighted safety issues. “Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” wrote Bray.

Bray is just the latest, most highly paid, Amazon employee to speak out. Other critics have not had the luxury of resigning and some of those who remain say the company is actively trying to silence them.

The pushback on critics comes as both Democrats and Republicans are calling for investigations into Amazon’s dominance. The company may be winning the sales war during the pandemic but the aftermath looks set to be a different story.

John Hopkins has worked at Amazon DSF4 distribution center in San Leandro, California, for about six months. During the pandemic, Hopkins started distributing pamphlets with information about union organizing to co-workers and posting them on bulletin boards in the warehouse in response to safety concerns he has had about how Amazon has protected workers from coronavirus.

“No matter where I put them in the building they turn up missing shortly thereafter,” said Hopkins. “This is 100% about stifling the seeds of a union before it can grow roots.”

On 1 May, the same day Bray resigned, Hopkins filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Amazon over the consistent removal of the pamphlets, while other flyers, such as postings for third-party contractor Amazon delivery jobs are permitted. Hopkins said his inquiries about posting the flyers to human resources have received no response.

Hopkins clocked out of his shift at midnight on 1 May in solidarity with the sick-out protest held by Amazon workers around the US, but stayed in the break room after his shift to hand out pamphlets and talk to co-workers about organizing. When management asked him to leave, he did so after arguing it was within his rights to speak to workers about advocating for better working conditions.

“I explained that since I hadn’t yet received a response from HR regarding my pamphlets, I felt that this was the only way that I had left to coordinate with my colleagues. I asked if they would set a time to meet with me about my concerns, or let me know when I could expect a response from HR and they refused to engage but just told me that I had to leave,” said Hopkins.

When he returned to work on 2 May, he found out he was suspended “for violating a new policy that says we can only be on site for 15 minutes before or after our shift ends”, he said.

At least six Amazon workers who have participated in protests or vocally advocated for improvements to worker safety and conditions have been fired during the pandemic, and several other workers have reported facing disciplinary write-ups from Amazon after protesting.

On 10 April, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa were fired from their corporate roles at Amazon after their group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, organized a virtual event for warehouse workers to speak with tech workers about working conditions and Amazon’s response to the pandemic.

“Amazon has been trying for quite some time to get rid of Maren and I. We felt very strongly about continuing to speak up because of how high the stakes are,” said Cunningham, a user experience designer who worked at Amazon since 2013. “This is a time where we have to deeply care about one another. We’re both in the climate crisis and a global pandemic and if we can’t stand with each other now, then when do we?”

Cunningham and Costa, a principal user experience designer who worked at Amazon since 2002, have been among the most visible workers pushing Amazon to take action and enact meaningful policies to combat the climate crisis. They have previously faced threats of termination for speaking to the media.

“There seems to be a pattern of censoring, silencing and firing, across the nation, around the world, with Amazon choosing to silence workers who are standing up for safety, basic human rights instead of taking criticism as an opportunity to do better,” said Costa.

At Amazon warehouses, Chris Smalls and Gerald Bryson at JFK8 in Staten Island, New York, were terminated shortly after participating in protests outside the warehouse over working conditions and lack of safety protections as coronavirus cases continued to rise at Amazon warehouses around the US. Bashir Mohamed, an employee for three years at Amazon’s MSP1 warehouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was also fired after he was advocating for better protections and cleaning during the pandemic.

In leaked memos Amazon’s general counsel, David Zapolsky, called Smalls “not smart, or articulate” and argued the media’s focus on him would leave Amazon “in a much stronger PR position than simply explaining for the umpteenth time how we’re trying to protect workers”. The company later apologized for the comments about Zapolsky, saying they were “personal and emotional” and born of frustration.

It is not only Amazon’s management who are frustrated. Courtney Bowden, 30, worked at an Amazon warehouse in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, for over two years before she was terminated on 30 March after being suspended for trying to provide a co-worker with a 24-hour dispatch hotline to report concerns with the shuttle service to the warehouse. She was previously vocal with management in asking for better safety protections for workers, such as adding more time clocks to promote social distancing, and paid time off for part-time workers.

“I had to file a charge with the NLRB because this whole incident stems from me trying to give somebody a telephone number for the shuttle bus company,” said Bowden. “Anybody who is outspoken about labor or safety issues, Amazon is retaliating against a lot of people at the moment. I was recently outspoken on two different occasions during the coronavirus and they chose to retaliate against me.”

An Amazon spokesperson told the Guardian in an email: “We respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so, but these rights do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, wellbeing or safety of their colleagues.” They added: “With over 1,000 sites around the world, and so many measures and precautions rapidly rolled out over the past several weeks across safety, pay, benefits and operational processes, there may be instances where we don’t get it perfect, but can assure you that’s just what they’ll be – exceptions.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/05/amazon-protests-union-organizing-cracking-down-workers
['John Mulholland'],2020-05-05,"On Giving Tuesday, stand with journalism that stands with science | John Mulholland","Relaying accurate information, in the normal course of events, is vital. Scrutinising government, in the normal course of events, is also vital. But these are not normal times. And our ability to carry out the functions of a news organisation is reliant on the financial resources that evidence-based reporting requires.

However, the Guardian, alongside many businesses, has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. Like many other news organisations, we are facing an unprecedented collapse in advertising revenues that further imperil the industry’s sustainability.

We rely to an ever-greater extent on our readers both for the moral force to continue doing journalism at a time like this and for the financial strength to facilitate that reporting.

And there has never been a greater need for that reporting. At a time when science and reason should be steering public policy, we see conjecture and instinct driving the US’s response. From touting untested hydroxychloroquine to suggesting ingesting bleach, the White House has ventilated anti-science. Drs Birx and Fauci have been all but silenced. Meanwhile, anti-vaxxers are storming state capitols and infiltrating the lockdown protests.

Science is fighting hard to be heard but the drumbeat of economic interests is drowning it out. The Guardian, however, will continue to give science a voice so that the US public can make informed decisions based on data, not dogma. Even as coronavirus cases rise across much of the country, the president has become the cheerleader-in-chief for reopening the states. Logic dictates we do otherwise but logic and reason are in short supply. And these decisions matter. It is critical that news organisations properly invigilate government policy and show how it shapes peoples’ lives – and their deaths. Without reader support, our ability to do so will be limited.

At a time like this, an independent news organisation that fights for data over dogma, and fact over fake, is essential

In our coverage to date, we have highlighted how this pandemic is disproportionately impacting people of color – both their health and economic wellbeing. African Americans have been dying in record numbers because they often live in polluted environments, have less access to healthcare and have more underlying conditions due to toxic stress. In economic terms, black and Hispanic Americans have been the hardest hit. This gives the lie to the so-called “booming economy”, which was already under-serving millions and millions of Americans. Race is never far from the surface of the country’s inequalities. With this pandemic, it is front and center.

And in our special project Lost on the Frontline, we have been determined to record the lives and deaths of frontline workers. Many of these workers are immigrants – even as this administration uses the pandemic to further its war on legal and illegal immigration.

As an outside news organisation headquartered in the UK, we can bring a different perspective to some of the more bizarre behaviors evident throughout the pandemic. In any other country, men armed with semi-automatic weapons storming government buildings would be referred to as “armed militias” or “extremists”. But here they are encouraged by the president. As Rashida Tlaib, the congresswoman from Michigan, said at the weekend: “Black people get executed by police for just existing, while white people dressed like militia members carrying assault weapons are allowed to threaten state legislators and staff.”

As we said, these are not normal times. And at a time like this, an independent news organisation that fights for data over dogma, and fact over fake, is not just optional. It is essential.

On this special edition of Giving Tuesday, and as our business model comes under even greater pressure, we’d love for you to consider supporting us so that we can carry on that essential work.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/giving-tuesday-journalism-science-coronavirus
['Jonathan Watts'],2020-05-05,One billion people will live in insufferable heat within 50 years – study,"The human cost of the climate crisis will hit harder, wider and sooner than previously believed, according to a study that shows a billion people will either be displaced or forced to endure insufferable heat for every additional 1C rise in the global temperature.

In a worst-case scenario of accelerating emissions, areas currently home to a third of the world’s population will be as hot as the hottest parts of the Sahara within 50 years, the paper warns. Even in the most optimistic outlook, 1.2 billion people will fall outside the comfortable “climate niche” in which humans have thrived for at least 6,000 years.

The authors of the study said they were “floored” and “blown away” by the findings because they had not expected our species to be so vulnerable.

“The numbers are flabbergasting. I literally did a double take when I first saw them, ” Tim Lenton, of Exeter University, said. “I’ve previously studied climate tipping points, which are usually considered apocalyptic. But this hit home harder. This puts the threat in very human terms.”

There will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6,000 years

Instead of looking at climate change as a problem of physics or economics, the paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examines how it affects the human habitat.

The vast majority of humanity has always lived in regions where the average annual temperatures are around 6C (43F) to 28C (82F), which is ideal for human health and food production. But this sweet spot is shifting and shrinking as a result of manmade global heating, which drops more people into what the authors describe as “near unliveable” extremes.

Humanity is particularly sensitive because we are concentrated on land – which is warming faster than the oceans – and because most future population growth will be in already hot regions of Africa and Asia. As a result of these demographic factors, the average human will experience a temperature increase of 7.5C when global temperatures reach 3C, which is forecast towards the end of this century.

At that level, about 30% of the world’s population would live in extreme heat – defined as an average temperature of 29C (84F). These conditions are extremely rare outside the most scorched parts of the Sahara, but with global heating of 3C they are projected to envelop 1.2 billion people in India, 485 million in Nigeria and more than 100 million in each of Pakistan, Indonesia and Sudan.

This would add enormously to migration pressures and pose challenges to food production systems.

“I think it is fair to say that average temperatures over 29C are unliveable. You’d have to move or adapt. But there are limits to adaptation. If you have enough money and energy, you can use air conditioning and fly in food and then you might be OK. But that is not the case for most people,” said one of the lead authors of the study, Prof Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University.

An ecologist by training, Scheffer said the study started as a thought-experiment. He had previously studied the climate distribution of rainforests and savanna and wondered what the result would be if he applied the same methodology to humans. “We know that most creatures’ habitats are limited by temperature. For example, penguins are only found in cold water and corals only in warm water. But we did not expect humans to be so sensitive. We think of ourselves as very adaptable because we use clothes, heating and air conditioning. But, in fact, the vast majority of people live – and have always lived – inside a climate niche that is now moving as never before.”

We were blown away by the magnitude,” he said. “There will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6,000 years.”

The authors said their findings should spur policymakers to accelerate emission cuts and work together to cope with migration because each degree of warming that can be avoided will save a billion people from falling out of humanity’s climate niche.

“Clearly we will need a global approach to safeguard our children against the potentially enormous social tensions the projected change could invoke,” another of the authors, Xu Chi of Nanjing University, said.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/one-billion-people-will-live-in-insufferable-heat-within-50-years-study
['Patrick Greenfield'],2020-05-05,Conservation in crisis: ecotourism collapse threatens communities and wildlife,"From Kenya to the Seychelles, coronavirus has dealt a devastating blow to efforts to protect endangered wildlife

From the vast plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya to the delicate corals of the Aldabra atoll in the Seychelles, conservation work to protect some of the world’s most important ecosystems is facing crisis following a collapse in ecotourism during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Organisations that depend on visitors to fund projects for critically endangered species and rare habitats could be forced to close, according to wildlife NGOs, after border closures and worldwide travel restrictions abruptly halted millions of pounds of income from tourism.

Throughout the pandemic, scientists have repeatedly urged humanity to reset its relationship with nature or suffer worse outbreaks. But the economic consequences of the Covid-19 lockdown have raised fears of a surge in poaching, illegal fishing and deforestation in life-sustaining ecosystems, with tens of thousands of jobs in the ecotourism sector at risk around the world.

“It’s right that the global focus now is on protecting human lives in this devastating pandemic. However, in the places we work, we are already witnessing its economic impact, particularly in areas where communities rely heavily on ecotourism for their livelihoods,” said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF UK.

In Cambodia, three critically endangered giant ibis were killed for meat in early April following the collapse of the local tourism industry, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. In central Africa, measures to shield mountain gorillas from the virus have resulted in a slump in vital visitor revenue. Twelve rangers who guarded Virunga national park, where the gorillas live, were killed in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo last month.

“It could be years before these places can fully recover, increasing the risk that people come to rely on other activities to make a living, putting unsustainable pressure on natural resources,” Bartlett said. “Additionally it is currently much harder to monitor land grabbing and illegal poaching.”

While the poaching of rhinos, big cats and critically endangered species has continued during lockdown, a recent Wildlife Justice Commission report found the illegal wildlife trade had been severely disrupted by movement and travel restrictions.

But conservationists fear an explosion of illegal hunting if organisations are forced to lay off wildlife rangers and suspend surveillance programmes. Black rhinos in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, have been evacuated after at least six were killed by poachers in March.

Dickson Kaelo, chief executive officer at Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, said all bookings for this year’s key activities such as the wildebeest migration in the Masai Mara had been cancelled, prompting difficult choices about staff in Kenya’s conservancies.

“While elephant poaching may not escalate owing to the current suppression of international travel and negative sentiments against animal products in south-east Asia, demand for bushmeat will go up if there is nobody to monitor activities within the conservancies,” he said.

“Poaching for bushmeat already existed on a small scale even before the coronavirus outbreak. With more Kenyans out of work, bushmeat will be more appealing than meat sold by the licensed butcher. If the rangers have no salaries, how will they effectively monitor human activities in and out of the conservancies?”

Wildlife conservation in Kenya had already suffered a series of setbacks following a devastating locust invasion and a viral outbreak among livestock in the the Greater Mara conservation area. Kaelo said coronavirus will compound the effects on community-led wildlife conservation.

“Members of these communities may lose faith in wildlife conservation if there is no money forthcoming. In addition, people who live around these wildlife havens and looked forward to selling artefacts to tourists may resort to other income-generating activities such as farming, fuelling the never-ending human-wildlife conflicts as animals invade and destroy their new farms,” he said.

In Colombia, the big cat conservation organisation Panthera has recorded a spike in big cat poaching, with two jaguars, an ocelot and a puma killed in recent weeks. The organisation has experienced delays in funding during the pandemic.

While rangers are forced to stay at home, Dr Esteban Payán, director of the jaguar programme in the region, said he was concerned about illegal land grabbing and intentional wildfires.

“My worst fear post-pandemic is that once we go out, we’re going to find hectares and hectares of fenced-out new farmland where you don’t know who they are or what is happening. There’s rampant deforestation in Colombia right now in the Amazon.

“That worries me more than increased poaching. Why? Because of the scale, size and speed of deforestation and fires. That just destroys the habitat. And with the habitat, there go the jaguars. You might not see a bloody animal on the ground with a bullet in it but it’s worse because they’re either homeless and burned, burned alive or they don’t have any prey.”

Global Fishing Watch has recorded a substantial drop in fishing around the world, with fishing hours down nearly 10% from 11 March to the end of April compared with the past two years. But the drop in ecotourism has affected conservation of the world’s most precious marine ecosystems.

Dr Fanny Douvere, Unesco’s marine programme coordinator for 50 world heritage sites, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Galápagos Islands and the West Norwegian Fjords, warned of the consequences of the downturn.

“We need to be particularly worried about those sites that are heavily dependent on tourism revenues to finance some of their operations. In the Seychelles, for example, Aldabra atoll is not sure how it’s going to continue with its monitoring because it’s entirely financed by revenues from tourism,” she said.

“As soon as tourism revenues fall apart, a lot of sites cannot continue their conservation, or at least part of it.”

['Jack Losh'],2020-05-05,Conservation in crisis: why Covid-19 could push mountain gorillas back to the brink,"Once a step away from extinction, their survival was a rare success story. But groundbreaking gorilla conservation is now in peril

As he clambers down the forested ravine, soil slipping beneath his boots, Dr Fred Nizeyimana knows they are close. “I can smell them,” he says, just before the mountain gorillas come into view high in the canopy, plucking leaves and chomping on the vegetation. An adult female slides down a tree, a flash of black fur and elongated limb. More follow, with infants and juveniles in tow. A grunting silverback descends to join its family, the branches buckling beneath approximately 180kg (400lb) of iconic primate.

Then Nizeyimana, a specialist vet offering hands-on care in the wild, spots a remarkable scene. Ambling up the steep, wooded slope, another gorilla family has emerged from the valley floor. The first group look on, then head deeper into the primeval jungle of Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable national park – one of Africa’s most ancient habitats and home to almost half of the world’s mountain gorillas.

Such a close and well-populated encounter with one of humankind’s nearest relatives (witnessed before the Covid-19 pandemic) would have been inconceivable during the dark days of the early 1980s, when it was estimated that there were only 250 mountain gorillas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) Virunga national park, and around 100 thought to be in Bwindi. That all-time low prompted fears they would vanish by the end of the 20th century. Even in early 2018, the conservation status of these gorillas put them one step away from extinction.

Now, thanks to a far-reaching initiative, a recent census has revealed the number of known mountain gorillas has increased to 1,063 – taking them off the red list of critically endangered species. Amid climate chaos and unbridled habitat destruction, this is a momentous achievement, albeit one that could now be reversed by the coronavirus pandemic.

Coronavirus poses lethal threat to great apes, experts warn Read more

Experts who led the revival put their success down to engaging local communities, securing government support and promoting transnational collaboration, a three-pronged strategy that could offer beleaguered areas worldwide a roadmap to recovery.

Not any one country could have, on its own, been responsible for the recovery Anna Behm Masozera, IGCP

“When done well, this can be a phenomenal success,” says Dr Timothy Tear, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Africa programme, which has been involved in the decades-long campaign to save the mountain gorilla. “We need to be recognising there are many more opportunities to do things like this in other countries.”

Environmentalists stress the importance of giving local communities a stake in the survival of the local area, ensuring they profit from ecotourism and other money-making activities that provide alternatives to hunting and resource exploitation. These income streams can fuel a country’s economic vitality, winning state support by helping to assert the animals’ worth to policymakers in capitals far from wilderness areas.

“The revenue that mountain gorillas produce is a major reason why governments are valuing this resource,” says Tear.

Permits to visit gorillas for one hour start at $600 (£479) per person in Uganda, rising to $1,500 in Rwanda. These sums are eye-watering, but crucial. Worldwide, up to $400bn a year is needed to conserve healthy ecosystems, a Credit Suisse report estimates, a long way from the $52bn actually raised.

Mountain gorilla habitats span Rwanda, Uganda and the war-wracked DRC, so partnerships unconstrained by political frontiers are essential. Such “conservation diplomacy” played out in 2015 when the three countries signed a treaty committing to coordinate the conservation of the region.

“Not any one country could have, on its own, been responsible for the recovery,” says Anna Behm Masozera, director of the IGCP, a regional coalition of environmental groups.

If this continues, it’s definitely going to reverse the achievements. There’s no doubt about it Bashir Hangi, Uganda Wildlife Authority

But serious threats remain, from irresponsible development to climate change – and now Covid-19.

Our simian ancestors share about 98% of human DNA and can catch respiratory diseases from people, with deadly consequences. Leading scientists warned last month that Covid-19 poses an “existential threat” to primates and that, for mountain gorillas in particular, the introduction of a new, highly-infectious disease could be a “potential extinction-level event”. In response, rangers in Bwindi are now required to wear face masks, use hand sanitiser and keep their distance from the apes.

The suspension of ecotourism during the coronavirus pandemic has also meant the main source of revenue for gorilla conservation has been lost and there are fears some of those in surrounding communities who depend on tourists could turn to poaching out of desperation. “We are worried,” says Bashir Hangi, a spokesman for the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the state body that manages Bwindi and nine other national parks. “If this continues, it’s definitely going to reverse the achievements. There’s no doubt about it.”

Back from the brink

Ever since a young military officer named Oscar von Beringe discovered mountain gorillas (then promptly shot two of them) in 1902, these magnificent mammals have endured persecution. Disease, hunting and habitat destruction have blighted their two populations, split between Bwindi in Uganda and the Virunga range of extinct volcanoes that straddle DRC, Rwanda and Uganda.

It was in 1979 that conservation groups first started collaborating to protect the dwindling population, founding the Mountain Gorilla Project to run tourism and education initiatives to change local attitudes. But gorilla numbers continued to drop, whether they were dying in traps intended for antelope, or being killed in retaliation for raiding crops. Grisly trinkets made from their hands and heads were sold in tourist markets.

The legendary primatologist Dian Fossey began using uncompromising methods to pull these critically-endangered creatures back from the brink, from repelling herders by spray-painting cattle to directly confronting poachers, many of whom were impoverished locals with few options.

In 1985, a few weeks before her 54th birthday, Fossey was murdered in Rwanda. Her killers were never found. Shortly before her murder, Fossey had said she feared there would be no mountain gorillas left within 15 years.

But a census one year after her death revealed the opposite; numbers were increasing. “There was a glimmer of success,” says Behm Masozera, the IGCP’s director. “In order to sustain that success, a more cohesive programme was built around it.”

This resulted in the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) – a coalition of nonprofits comprising Conservation International, Fauna & Flora International and WWF that was more formalised than the Mountain Gorilla Project, with a remit across DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. This long-term alliance, argues one member, should be replicated elsewhere. “This is entirely the way we need to be working,” says Cath Lawson, regional conservation manager for Africa at WWF-UK, “to have that transformational change for wildlife like mountain gorillas to thrive.”

In 2003, despite DRC’s protracted conflict and the earlier horrors of the Rwandan genocide, sustained efforts had increased Virunga’s population to 380. An additional 320 in the cloud forests of Bwindi brought the total population to 700 individuals. The upward trajectory continued, propelled by 2015’s intergovernmental treaty. Snares, fashioned from ropes or wires that cut deep into gorilla flesh, began to disappear.

By November 2018 the number of known mountain gorillas reached 1,063. But there is no room for complacency. “Yes, this demonstrates what we can achieve,” says Lawson. “But it’s not a done deal.”

Ecotourism has played a central role in this conservation triumph, alongside a scheme that splits the revenue with nearby communities, adapting earlier divisive models of “fortress conservation” into something more inclusive and equitable.

Undeniably, though, coercive methods to protect wildlife have devastated traditional life for Batwa “pygmies”, a forest-dependent indigenous minority who were evicted in their thousands from Bwindi and other Ugandan parks as protection activities ramped up in the early 1990s and continue to suffer today.

Yet other local communities hail the Bwindi project – and its pragmatic fusion of wealth creation with environmentalism – as a genuine gain.

The Change A Life Bwindi charity trains former poachers in beekeeping, mothers in basket weaving, and teenage girls unable to afford school in tailoring. These income-generating activities emphasise the advantages of living near a thriving gorilla population to which cash-rich westerners are drawn daily.

“We see Bwindi as a good thing,” says Hilda Ariho, a 30-year-old community leader. “It brings tourists here and without it we’d be poorer. It’s helping a lot of women.”

Back inside the park, after Nizeyimana spots the two gorilla families, a group of tourists have one hour to absorb the scene, whether by taking a slew of selfies or observing in quiet contemplation.

The tourists depart and the silverback reclines, watching over his relatives in a mountainous landscape that for approximately 25,000 years has woven itself into an awe-inspiring tangle of vines, trunks and creepers across the Albertine Rift valley.

Conservationists are hoping that these mountain gorillas continue to thrive and that the latest threat, Covid-19, can be beaten.

"['Alastair Gee', 'Dani Anguiano']",2020-05-05,"We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back | Alastair Gee, Dani Anguiano","About 12,000 years ago, human domestication of the natural world began in earnest with the intentional cultivation of wild plants and animals. Fast forward to today and our dominion over the planet appears complete, as 7.8 billion of us multiply across its surface and our reach extends from the deep-sea beds, which are being mined, to the heavens, where we are, according to Donald Trump, dispatching a space force.

Yet as has been made clear by a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticated. Indeed, our interference with the natural world is making them more liable to flare up into tragedy. We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back.

'It sounded evil': inside the eerie moment California’s deadliest wildfire began Read more

Covid-19 appears to have emerged in a Wuhan seafood and wild animal market, yet some scientists argue that its true origin story lies in the disruption of ecosystems. Genetic testing indicates that the virus probably came from bats, and at some point may have been transmitted via an intermediate species such as the pangolin, the most trafficked animal in the world. Although pangolins were not – officially – listed as traded at the market, it was certainly host to other wild animals such as wolf pups, crocodiles and civets.

“Wild animals carry their own unique viruses,” David Quammen, the author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, told Yale Environment 360. “When we go into a tropical forest with its great diversity, and we start cutting down trees, and capturing animals, or killing animals for food” – or sending them to markets where they can mix with farm animals and humans – “then we offer those viruses the opportunity to become our viruses, to jump into us and find a new host, a much more abundant host”.

The risk of diseases spreading from animals to humans is in fact greatest when the animals concerned are endangered and in decline owing to trafficking and habitat destruction, a recent study found. The climate crisis and human population growth are “disease amplifiers”, according to the World Health Organization.

We know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, biodiversity destruction, political instability

Wildfires similarly show how our remaking of the natural world has had disastrous consequences. In our new book Fire in Paradise, which is based on our extensive reporting for the Guardian and published today, we document the destruction of an entire California city in 2018 by a fire of unprecedented severity in modern times. Claiming 85 lives, it is the deadliest ever wildfire in the state.

Wildfires are native to the western US in the same way that monsoons or hurricanes are native to other places. Yet a century of efforts to stamp them out and protect human lives and property in California has left the state’s forests and grasslands unnaturally dense with flammable vegetation that would otherwise have burned off in semi-regular but low-intensity burns. To make matters worse, global heating is rendering California’s wild places ever drier.

Paradise’s residents knew of the sword that hung over their heads. The town had an evacuation plan and an emergency robocall system. In the summer of 2018, a horrifying and awe-inspiring fire tornado 1,000ft wide had laid waste to an area just 80 miles away. “It’s not a matter of if,” one longtime resident, Iris Natividad, told us. “It’s a matter of when.”

Even so, no one imagined how bad it would be on that morning in early November, when a spark from a PG&E transmission tower ignited the brush that surrounded it, at one point consuming nearly 400 American football fields’ worth of vegetation a minute on its sprint into Paradise. Flames that burned as hot as a crematorium melted cars and blowtorched thousands of homes. The fire trapped people in town and caught many unaware.

Paradise suffered total devastation, and the images of neighborhoods reduced to nothing but piles of ash shocked the world.

We’d say this was the new normal – except that actually “it would be a mistake to assume that the region has reached any semblance of a stable plateau”, three wildfire scientists wrote for the Guardian only a few months before the Paradise fire. We know there will continue to be huge fires. We also know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, biodiversity destruction, political instability, and expanded ranges for mosquitoes and ticks.

Yet one optimistic lesson from the Covid-19 tragedy is that we can act. We will heed the calls to stay home, and we will condemn the economy in the process, if it means saving lives. And we will do it overnight.

On our part-domesticated, still-wild planet, in the geologic era that bears our name, we’ve learned that we do indeed possess the willpower to prevent another pandemic, and another Paradise.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/we-created-the-anthropocene-and-the-anthropocene-is-biting-back

Trump rails at 'loser types' as dissident Republican ad gets under his skin

A political ad criticizing Donald Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has prompted a string of name-calling, angry tweets from the president, in which he derided his critics as “loser types”.

Trump gives up on virus fight to focus on economic recovery – and re-election Read more

While Twitter rants are common for the president, this series has the flavor of personal grudge. The ad, called Mourning in America, was produced by a group of anti-Trump Republicans, prominently co-founded by the husband of one of Trump’s senior advisers.

The ad riffs on former president Ronald Reagan’s classic 1984 re-election ad, Morning in America, a one-minute commercial where young Americans get married, buy a home and raise the flag.

In contrast, Mourning in America show a decrepit factory, a body wheeled away on a gurney, and Americans lining up in the rain in masks, presumably to get coronavirus tests.

Bioluminescent waves dazzle surfers in California: 'Never seen anything like it'

Mother nature has provided a radical gift to nighttime beach-goers in southern California, in the form of bioluminescent waves that crash and froth with an otherworldly light.

California eases Covid-19 restrictions, allowing some businesses to reopen Read more

The event occurs every few years along the coast of southern California, though locals say this year’s sea sparkle is especially vibrant, possibly related to historic rains that soaked the region and generated algal bloom.

For some, this year’s light show was especially meaningful, coming just as beaches began to reopen after an almost month-long closure due to coronavirus.

Dale Huntington, a 37-year-old pastor at a church in south-eastern San Diego, got up at 3am after beaches reopened to surf the iridescent waves.

“I’ve been surfing for 20 years now, and I’ve never seen anything like it”, Huntington said.

The neon waves owe their color to blooming microscopic plants called phytoplankton. By day, the organisms collect on the water’s surface to give the water a reddish-brown hue, known as the red tide. By night, the algae put on a light show, dazzling most brightly in turbulent waters.

One photographer off the coast of Newport Beach, where crowds in recent weeks have protested against closures, recorded a dolphin jetting through bioluminescence like a sea spectre.

The phosphorescent display has captured the attention of locals in southern California, with many emerging from shelter-in-place restrictions to catch a glimpse of the surreal scenery.

One San Diegan, who lives in a neighborhood along the coast, implored local officials to restrict access to the beach, complaining that the red tide has drawn large crowds comparable to a “Fourth of July on steroids”.

For surfers like Huntington, the spectacle has provided joy and relief amid the challenges of the pandemic. “My favorite part was paddling out – it was almost like there was a glow stick around your hand,” he described. “My board left a bioluminescent wake. There were a few of us out there and we were giggling, grown men shouting ‘this is so cool’ and splashing around like kids in the bathtub.”

Swimming, surfing, kayaking and paddleboarding are allowed under San Diego’s recently amended shelter-in-place restrictions.

Red tides, which stretch from Baja California up the coast to Los Angeles, have been observed since the early 1900s and can last from a few days to a couple of months. Scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, who study the phenomenon, say the glow shows are most lively at least two hours after sunset.

Scientists don’t know exactly how long this year’s red tide will last, but for Huntington, this year’s light show was doubly welcome.

“I think we’re all looking for light in a dark time” he said. “And this sweet moment was an opportunity to find joy amidst struggle.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/california-beaches-bioluminescent-waves-algae-bloom
['Sam Levine'],2020-05-05,Judge reinstates New York's presidential primary after state cancelled it,"Critics had said decision to call off presidential primary amounted to voter suppression, and could alienate Sanders supporters

A federal judge has reinstated New York’s June Democratic presidential primary, siding with Andrew Yang, the former candidate, who sued the state in federal court and called the recent decision to cancel the contest “authoritarian and illegal”.

The judge ruled Tuesday that the state had wrongfully removed the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Yang and eight other former presidential candidates from the ballot.

The decision came after two Democrats on the state’s election commission cancelled the presidential primary last week, relying on a new budget provision allowing them to remove presidential candidates who suspended their campaigns. The move outraged Sanders supporters and other progressives who said New York, a Democratic bastion, was actively disenfranchising voters.

“It goes against what the party stands for,” said Heather Key, who volunteered for the Sanders campaign. “They’re always on the case about gerrymandering and cheating with the GOP. And yet here they are controlling whether we can vote for the president for our choosing.”

The US district judge Analisa Torres wrote that the state had deprived voters of their constitutional guarantee of freedom of association. New York voters, she said, weren’t just voting for a presidential candidate, but also for delegates who could influence the direction of the Democratic National Convention in August. (Sanders and Biden announced an agreement last month to let Sanders keep hundreds of delegates, and make sure the senator is represented at the Democratic national convention.)

“The removal of presidential contenders from the primary ballot not only deprived those candidates of the chance to garner votes for the Democratic party’s nomination…it deprived Democratic voters of the opportunity to elect delegates who could push their point of view in that forum.”

Election officials had argued that holding a largely symbolic presidential primary would be costly and put people’s health at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. In Wisconsin and Florida, poll workers and voters tested positive for Covid-19 after election day. “[T]he holding of a presidential primary could strain the system to the point of buckling,” Robert Brehm, the co-executive director of the New York State Board of Elections, wrote in a court filing.

But Torres noted that the state was encouraging voters to vote by mail and doubted that cancelling the presidential primary entirely would significantly stop the spread of Covid-19. (A spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections declined to comment on the ruling, saying lawyers were reviewing it.)

Michael Bloomberg expands influence network within Democratic party Read more

Before Tuesday’s decision, Sanders supporters said the cancellation amounted to a stunning episode of voter suppression from Democrats at a time when the party is making expanding voting rights a core part of its platform. “It’s an insult to us,” said Habiba Choudhary, who had been canvassing for the senator.

But New York has long placed severe restrictions on voting, despite its reputation as one of the most progressive states in the US. The state had one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the 2016 election.

Biden is unlikely to lose New York and its 29 electoral college votes in November. But not giving Sanders supporters the chance to cast even a symbolic vote for him would have left his supporters unmotivated to commit to organizing for Biden, said Melanie D’Arrigo, who is running in a Democratic congressional primary in June.

“Will those voters knock doors, will those voters make calls, will those voters advocate on behalf of Joe Biden? I don’t know,” she said.

Some voters, such as Key, had also considered not voting in the general election at all.

It’s possible the back and forth of the election commission could still cause confusion. The cancellation would have meant that 35 of New York’s 62 counties will have a reduction in the number of voters who have primaries, and seven counties wouldn’t have had a primary at all. Campaigns have been relying on text messaging and email campaigns to keep people informed.

“It’s uncanny how many people think the next election is in November now,” said Jabari Brisport, a Democrat who is running in a primary for a state senate seat in Brooklyn.

There’s more at stake than the presidential primary in New York. New York has become home to a wave of progressive politicians, most notable Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Brisport said botching the primary would make it harder to replicate that success.

“A lot of progressive challengers like myself see this a direct attempt to protect incumbents,” he said of the previously cancelled presidential primary.

With just a few months until the Democratic conventions, Rachel Himes, an organizer with the Democratic Socialists of America who canvassed for Sanders, said New York voters deserve to have their voices heard.

“The principle of democracy is such that even when it seems like the election is a foregone conclusion, everyone should be able to vote,” said Himes. “People don’t have investment in the process, and why would they?”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/new-york-presidential-primary-cancelled-judge
[],2020-05-05,Trump administration drafts pact for mining on the moon,"The Trump administration is drafting a legal blueprint for mining on the moon under a new US-sponsored international agreement called the Artemis Accords, according to people familiar with the proposed pact.

The agreement would be the latest effort to cultivate allies around Nasa’s plan to put humans and space stations on the moon within the next decade, and comes as the civilian space agency plays a growing role in implementing American foreign policy. The draft pact has not been formally shared with US allies yet.

The Trump administration and other spacefaring countries see the moon as a key strategic asset in outer space. The moon also has value for long-term scientific research that could enable future missions to Mars – activities that fall under a regime of international space law widely viewed as outdated.

The Artemis Accords, named after the Nasa’s new Artemis moon program, propose “safety zones” that would surround future moon bases to prevent damage or interference from rival countries or companies operating in close proximity.

The pact also aims to provide a framework under international law for companies to own the resources they mine, the sources said.

In the coming weeks, US officials plan to formally negotiate the accords with space partners such as Canada, Japan, and European countries, as well as the United Arab Emirates, opening talks with countries the Trump administration sees as having “like-minded” interests in lunar mining.

Russia, a major partner with Nasa on the International Space Station, will not be an early partner in these accords, the sources said, as the Pentagon increasingly views Moscow as hostile for making “threatening” satellite maneuvers toward US spy satellites in Earth orbit.

The United States is a member of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and sees the “safety zones” as an implementation of one of its highly debated articles. It states that celestial bodies and the moon are “not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”

“This isn’t some territorial claim,” said one source, who requested anonymity to discuss the agreement. The safety zones, whose size would vary depending on the operation, would allow for coordination between space actors without technically claiming territory as sovereign, he said.

“The idea is if you are going to be coming near someone’s operations, and they’ve declared safety zones around it, then you need to reach out to them in advance, consult and figure out how you can do that safely for everyone.”

The Artemis Accords are part of the Trump administration’s plan to forgo the treaty process at the United Nations and instead reach agreement with “like-minded nations”, partly because a treaty process would take too long and working with non-spacefaring states would be unproductive, a senior administration official told Reuters.

As countries increasingly treat space as a new military domain, the US-led agreement is also emblematic of Nasa’s growing role as a tool of American diplomacy and is expected to stoke controversy among Washington’s space rivals such as China.

“Nasa’s all about science and technology and discovery, which are critically important, but I think less salient is the idea that Nasa is a tool of diplomacy,” Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said Tuesday.

Nasa is investing tens of billions of dollars into the Artemis program, which calls for putting humans on the moon by 2024 and building up a “sustainable presence” on the lunar south pole thereafter, with private companies mining lunar rocks and subsurface water that can be converted to rocket fuel.

The United States enacted a law in 2015 granting companies the property rights to resources they mine in outer space, but no such laws exist in the international community.

Joanne Gabrynowicz, editor-in-chief emerita of the Journal of Space Law, said an international agreement must come before staking out “some kind of exclusive area for science or for whatever reason”.

“It is not anything any nation can do unilaterally and still have it be legal,” she said.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/05/trump-mining-moon-us-artemis-accords

The coronavirus pandemic has cost Walt Disney $1.4bn in the last three months as the virus shut down its theme parks around the world and halted film and TV productions, the company announced on Tuesday.

The world’s largest media company said its operating income for the three months ending 28 March had fallen 37% to $2.4bn after it was forced to close parks, cancel cruises and delay future productions.

Disney felt the impact of the pandemic earlier than many US companies. It closed its parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong in January and its outpost in Japan in February before closing resorts in the US and Europe a month later.

The company estimates it lost $1bn over the three months in its parks, experiences and products segment, mostly due to revenue lost because of closures.

Disney+, the company’s new streaming service, however, has benefitted from the global quarantines imposed to slow the virus. Disney+ had 33.5 million paid subscribers by the end of March and passed the 50 million mark in April as more people stayed home and signed up.

On a call with financial analysts, the chief executive, Bob Chapek, said the company is “seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some sense of normalcy in China” and would reopen its Shanghai Disneyland park on 11 May with a phased approach.

Chapek said Disney would put new procedures in place at its parks once they reopen, including limiting guest capacity, temperature checks and masks.

Disney’s stock hit at an all-time high before the pandemic. In 2019, a record seven Disney movies brought in more than $1bn each including Avengers: Endgame, Frozen II and The Lion King.

['Robert Tait'],2020-05-05,Prague revamp reveals Jewish gravestones used to pave streets,"Dozens of paving stones made from Jewish headstones have been found during redevelopment work in Prague’s tourist district, confirming speculation that the former communist regime raided synagogues and graveyards for building materials.

Tuesday’s discovery came in the opening phase of a £10.6m facelift project in the city’s landmark Wenceslas Square, scene of the some of the Czech Republic’s most dramatic historic events and a frequent site of political protest.

Rabbi Chaim Kočí, a senior official with the Prague rabbinate, witnessed workers unearthing cobblestones whose undersides revealed Hebrew lettering, the star of David and deceased dates. Other stones were blank but had polished surfaces that indicated they had also been taken from cemeteries.

Jewish leaders hailed the unearthing as proof of long-held suspicions that the communist authorities – who ruled the former Czechoslovakia for more than four decades during the cold war – had taken stonework from Jewish burial sites for a much-vaunted pedestrianisation of Wenceslas Square during the 1980s.

The flagship project was showcased during a walkabout tour by the-then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987.

Suspicions that some of its stonework may have been from a cemetery were first raised by the director of Prague’s Jewish museum, Leo Pavlat, who recalled finding two paving stones with headstone markings when work on the original scheme was taking place. His comments prompted Prague city council to agree to allow the Jewish community to inspect the site once the latest redevelopment started.

“We feel this is a victory for us because until now this was just a rumour. Maybe there were Jewish stones here, but nobody knew,” said Kočí, who had been at Wenceslas Square since early morning to witness the stones being dug up. “It’s important because it’s a matter of truth.

“We are making something right for the historical record. These are stones from the graves of people who were dead for maybe 100 years and now they are lying here. It’s not nice.”

The names of the dead are unidentifiable because the headstones have been broken to form cobblestones. One person appears to have died in 1877, when Prague was part of the Habsburg empire, while the most recent death is shown to have happened in the 1970s, during the height of communism.

The stones appear to have been taken from different cemeteries.

Community leaders plan to gather them to form a memorial at Prague’s old Jewish cemetery in the city’s Žižkov district, part of which was desecrated during the communist era to build a public park and subsequently to construct a massive television tower.

Synagogues and cemeteries were allowed to fall into disrepair under an officially sanctioned hostile policy towards religious institutions in general and Judaism in particular, making them vulnerable to looting.

František Bányai, the chairman of Prague’s Jewish community, said the discovery made him angry at the communist regime.

“More Jewish synagogues were destroyed in the area of the current Czech Republic during communist times than under the Nazis,” he said. “It was because of their special approach to religion. Anti-Judaism was official policy and all the Jewish committees were supervised and managed by control of the secret police. To be Jewish was negative from any point of view – but it was the same for the Christian church.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/prague-revamp-reveals-jewish-gravestones-used-to-pave-streets
['Julia Carrie Wong'],2020-05-05,California sues Uber and Lyft for misclassifying drivers as contractors,"California is suing Uber and Lyft, alleging they misclassified their drivers as independent contractors under the state’s new labor law, in the most significant challenge to the ride-hailing companies’ employment model to date.

Xavier Becerra, the state’s attorney general, announced the lawsuit Tuesday during a news conference. The labor law, known as AB5 and considered the nation’s strictest test, took effect on 1 January and makes it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors instead of employees who are entitled to minimum wage and benefits such as workers compensation and unemployment benefits – a key exclusion that has come to the fore during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Uber and Lyft claim their drivers aren’t engaged in the companies’ core mission and cannot qualify for benefits,” said Becerra. “These companies will take the workers’ labor, but they won’t accept the worker protections. California has ground rules with rights and protections for workers and their employers. We intend to make sure that Uber and Lyft play by the rules.”

The dispute over the employment status of Uber and Lyft drivers is as old as the companies themselves. Over the years, gig economy companies have attracted – and largely fought off or settled – a host of class-action lawsuits over employee classification. But an enforcement lawsuit by the state, which will not have the same incentive to settle as a private plaintiff’s attorney, represents an “unprecedented” escalation that is much more likely to bring about meaningful change, said Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California Hastings who researches the gig economy.

“These companies should have never been allowed to proliferate using the business model they were using, and it was the state of California that first legalized and allowed this, so that it’s the state of California that is finally stepping in and saying that these are employees is so gratifying,” Dubal said in an interview.

California represents Uber and Lyft’s largest source of revenue. The companies, as well as Doordash, have invested $30m apiece in a ballot initiative campaign to exclude their drivers from the law while giving new benefits such as health care coverage. The initiative is likely to qualify for the November ballot.

The ballot initiative campaign was the subject of a scathing reference in the legal complaint filed by the state, which lambasted the companies for launching “an aggressive public relations campaign in the hopes of enshrining their ability to mistreat their workers” in the middle of “a once-in-a-century pandemic”.

A federal judge in February denied Uber and Postmates’ request for a preliminary injunction that would have exempted them from the law. But separately, a federal judge in January indefinitely blocked the law from applying to more than 70,000 independent truckers, deciding that it is preempted by federal rules on interstate commerce.

The state legislature is also considering amending the law, though lawmakers are split whether to broaden or narrow it as other groups – such as freelance writers and photographers – contend they have been hurt by it through unintended consequences.

The state’s lawsuit alleges that Uber and Lyft haven’t paid enough payroll taxes as a result of the misclassification. The suit seeks restitution for unpaid wages owed to drivers, civil penalties and a permanent ruling that would prohibit the companies from misclassifying drivers in the future.

“We are looking forward to working with the attorney general and mayors across the state to bring all the benefits of California’s innovation economy to as many workers as possible, especially during this time when the creation of good jobs with access to affordable healthcare and other benefits is more important than ever,” Lyft said in a statement.

“At a time when California’s economy is in crisis with four million people out of work, we need to make it easier, not harder, for people to quickly start earning,” a spokesman for Uber said in a statement. “We will contest this action in court, while at the same time pushing to raise the standard of independent work for drivers in California, including with guaranteed minimum earnings and new benefits.”

A US government scientist has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was ousted from his position after raising concerns that the Trump administration wanted to “flood” coronavirus hotspots like New York and New Jersey with a malaria drug that Donald Trump was pushing despite scant scientific evidence it helped.

Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, filed the complaint on Tuesday with the Office of Special Counsel, a government agency responsible for whistleblower complaints. He alleges he was reassigned to a lesser role because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug favored by the president.

Bright also said the Trump administration rejected his warnings on Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Bright said he “acted with urgency” to address the growing spread of Covid-19 after the World Health Organization issued a warning in January.

Hydroxychloroquine: how an unproven drug became Trump’s coronavirus 'miracle cure' Read more

He said he “encountered resistance from HHS leadership, including health and human services secretary [Alex] Azar, who appeared intent on downplaying this catastrophic event”.

Bright alleges in the complaint that political appointees at the Department of Health and Human Services had tried to promote hydroxychloroquine “as a panacea”. The officials also “demanded that New York and New Jersey be ‘flooded’ with these drugs, which were imported from factories in Pakistan and India that had not been inspected by the FDA”, the complaint says.

But Bright opposed broad use of the drug. He felt an urgent need to tell the public that there wasn’t enough scientific evidence to support using the drugs for Covid-19 patients, the complaint states.

In a statement issued late last month, Bright said: “While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.”

Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration warned doctors against prescribing the drug except in hospitals and research studies. In an alert, regulators flagged reports of sometimes fatal heart-related side-effects among coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine or the related drug chloroquine.

The decades-old drugs, also prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause a number of side-effects, including heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.

['Julian Borger'],2020-05-05,Trump loyalist set to become national intelligence director on second attempt,"A Trump loyalist nominated as director of national intelligence (DNI) looked set to sail through Senate confirmation hearings on Tuesday, only nine months after being forced to withdraw for having exaggerated his security experience.

John Ratcliffe, a Republican congressman who fiercely defended the president in last year’s impeachment hearings, told the Senate intelligence committee that he would speak truth to power if confirmed as DNI.

Ratcliffe was reminded by Democratic senators that his two predecessors had been forced from their posts because the findings of the intelligence community irritated Donald Trump, and that the spy agencies were currently under pressure to provide evidence for Trump’s claim that the coronavirus outbreak started in a Chinese laboratory.

“Regardless of what anyone wants our intelligence to reflect, the intelligence I will provide, if confirmed, will not be impacted or altered as a result of outside influence,” Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks at his confirmation hearing, held under social distancing rules, with most of the senators and staff wearing masks. “Above all, my fidelity and loyalty will always be to the constitution and rule of law, and my actions as DNI will reflect that commitment.”

However Ratcliffe, a fiercely partisan congressman, dodged questions on which Trump has broken with his own intelligence briefers, such as whether there has been any progress towards North Korean disarmament (there has not) and whether Iran was in compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal when Trump pulled the US out of the agreement (it was).

Ratcliffe said that if confirmed, he would focus on the impact of coronavirus, questions about its origins in China and US competition with Beijing.

“I view China as the greatest threat actor right now,” he said. “Look with respect to Covid-19 and the role China plays; the race to 5G; cybersecurity issues: all roads lead to China,” he told the panel.

Ratcliffe withdrew his first nomination five days after Trump first named him as a candidate – to widespread surprise – last July, after it was found he had grossly overstated his national security experience.

He had falsely claimed on his website to have “arrested over 300 illegal immigrants in a single day” and had “put terrorists in prison” although he had not tried a terrorism case in his time as a US attorney.

“I don’t see what has changed since last summer … when the president decided not to proceed with your nomination over concerns about your inexperience, partisanship and past statements that seemed to embellish your record,” the ranking Democrat on committee, Senator Mark Warner, said on Tuesday.

However the committee chair, Senator Richard Burr, and the other Republicans on the panel, indicated they would back Ratcliffe’s nomination and quickly put it to a vote in the full Senate, despite a legal requirement that the DNI “shall have extensive national security expertise”.

“The Democrats in the committee and the Senate seem strongly opposed, but Ratcliffe seems likely to secure confirmation, probably on a party-line vote,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor.

Tobias suggested that Ratcliffe’s promises to be objective may have assuaged doubters on the committee, or that Burr’s standing and independence may have been weakened after he was found to have sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks in mid-February, a few days after publishing a commentary for Fox News claiming that the US was “better prepared than ever before” to confront the virus.

Katrina Mulligan, a former official who worked for more than 10 years in the office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI), suggested another factor that has changed since last summer could be that the Senate is eager to replace the current acting DNI, Richard Grenell, another partisan with even less experience than Ratcliffe and who is not answerable to Congress because he is not confirmed in the role.

Mulligan added that US intelligence officials may be resigned to Ratcliffe getting the top job for similar reasons.

Time is humanity’s ultimate organizing principle, and many, myself included, have longed for a neat finale during this pandemic – a day we can patiently wait for, when this will all be over.

At first, political authorities in many countries spoke of societal lockdown in terms of weeks – a challenge, yes, but a manageable one; there are even those who treated it as a rather novel adventure. More recently, as understanding of the pandemic develops, that metric is shifting, discouragingly, to months – even years.

Last week, Chris Whitty, the UK chief medical adviser, said that social distancing would have to continue at least all year, while Canadians have been told to expect limits on travel and gatherings for likely around a year and a half. Donald Trump recently admitted that America’s pandemic guidelines – which he initially claimed would be null by Easter – would likely remain into summer and, enigmatically, “beyond that”. Some regions are considering how to gradually reopen their economies, yet the experiences of Asian countries where infections surged as restrictions eased serve as cautionary tales. Dozens of experts have attested there will be no quick return to our previous lives.

Now that we are no longer at the beginning of this pandemic but in the seemingly interminable middle, the more relevant question to ask is not “when will this end?” but “how can we cope with this dragging on?”

One healthy thing you can do is to pre-emptively curb disappointment by readjusting your horizons, says Dr Amelia Aldao, a psychologist specializing in anxiety. Some of us may still have our hopes fixed to an event in the future – a July wedding we half-expect to attend, or a September getaway we think might just work out - and that can be problematic, says Aldao. “The way things are shaping up, there’s a lot of uncertainty – what’s going to be open? Is there going to be a second wave [of outbreaks]?” We just don’t know.

Looking forward to plans can be psychologically beneficial, keeping us engaged in life. But given the current circumstances, “Either focus on the right here, right now, the immediate days and weeks – we all have a lot of control over the next week,” says Aldao, “Or try focusing on the more distant future – maybe a year or more from now.”

Aldao’s advice dovetails with the wisdom of the US navy vice admiral James Stockdale. Stockdale, who spent seven years as a prisoner of the Vietnam war, is renowned for his articulation of what is now called “Stockdale’s paradox,” a “hope for the best, prepare for the worst” ethos captured by his quote: “You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end … with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.”

An advocate of steely pragmatism in the face of adversity, Stockdale observed that his cellmates – “the optimists” who believed they would be free by Christmas, then, when that didn’t happen, by Easter, and so on – became demoralized and “died of a broken heart”.

While our circumstances are distinctly unlike Stockdale’s, his wisdom regarding how to cope with uncertainty still resonates: we cannot afford to spend the entirety of this pandemic expecting normalcy to manifest just around the bend – doing so only compounds our pain.

So, aside from cancelling our plans and relinquishing faith in a clear-cut end date, how do we really confront the most brutal facts of our current reality, without getting bogged down by the sheer glumness of it all? It may sound counter-intuitive, but according to the psychologist and self-awareness researcher Dr Tasha Eurich, we can start by planning ahead for worst-case scenarios.

“We’re not going to be able to control the uncontrollable, but we can make a contingency plan,” says Eurich. “For example: if we’re all locked up in our houses until there’s a vaccine, the question should be, ‘Using everything I can control, how can I create a livable new reality, knowing that it won’t last forever, but knowing that my plan for a four-week isolation is going to be a lot different than for one that’s 12 months long?’”

We’re not going to be able to control the uncontrollable, but we can make a contingency plan Dr Tasha Eurich

You don’t want to get stuck ruminating on your fears, “but you have to figure out what could happen so you can control what you can, without it becoming a source of constant sadness,” she says. Make a plan for tangible circumstances, like what you will do if you or someone you live with gets sick, if your business cannot reopen, if a natural disaster occurs while you’re in lockdown – then put it aside and try not to worry about it.

You can also shift your focus inward. “Imagine you’re sitting with your grandkids in 50 years and they ask you, ‘What was it like during the pandemic?’” says Eurich. “Ask yourself, ‘What are the things in my life I want to use this as an opportunity to get clearer on, and how can I reframe my situation with that longer lens to figure out what I should be focused on right now?’”

If you find yourself worrying, Eurich suggests assessing your wellbeing in the moment – and appreciating what you do have. “To me, hope for the future can be replaced by hope for the present – gratitude,” she says.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/coronavirus-uncertainty-how-to-prepare
['Kevin Rawlinson'],2020-05-06,Coronavirus latest: at a glance,"Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:

Global confirmed death toll exceeds 255,000

At least 256,239 people are known to have died since the outbreak began, while there have been at least 3,651,010 confirmed infections, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The figures are likely to vastly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic because they are reliant on official and media reports and do not include, for example, the many people presumed to have been infected but not tested.

Top UK adviser resigns over lockdown breach

The epidemiologist credited with convincing the UK government to abandon thoughts of pursuing herd immunity in favour of physical distancing resigns amid alleged breaches of lockdown rules.

Prof Neil Ferguson steps down from his government advisory position as the Daily Telegraph reveals that a woman with whom he is in a romantic relationship, but who lives elsewhere, visited him at his home during the lockdown.

Trump to wind down pandemic taskforce

Despite the US death toll passing 70,000, the president, Donald Trump, says he is keen to move towards a reopening of the economy and will dismantle the White House taskforce.

“[They] have done a great job. But we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening and we’ll have a different group probably set up for that.”

‘Will some people be affected badly? Yes.’

Trump suggests the deaths that would inevitably follow a premature easing of lockdown conditions are a price worth paying to protect the US economy.

“Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon. I’m viewing our great citizens of this country to a certain extent and to a large extent as warriors.”

Mexico ‘winning the battle’, minister claims

The country’s deputy health minister, Hugo López-Gatell, who has spearheaded Mexico’s response to the outbreak, says it is containing the virus, even as he cautions that a second wave of seasonal illness could strike in October.

“We’re winning. The numbers are encouraging. We still have a very broad response capacity.”

Brazil sees first total lockdown

São Luís, capital of the north-eastern state of Maranhão, becomes the country’s first city to declare such restrictions – in direct opposition to the president Jair Bolsonaro, who has railed against social isolation and dismissed a soaring death toll.

The lockdown in the city and three neighbouring towns was ordered by a judge after intensive care beds in state government hospitals filled up.

UK misses testing target again

The country’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, says 84,806 tests were carried out on Monday. Ministers promised the UK would be carrying out 100,000 tests per day by the end of last month.

It claimed to have met that target on two days after including tests that had been posted but not carried out. But testing numbers have quickly fallen away again and the UK has now missed the target on three consecutive days.

Italy records smallest increase in cases for two months

Deaths in Italy climb by 236 on Tuesday, against 195 the day before, while the daily tally of new infections stands at 1,075, against 1,221 on Monday. It is the smallest number of new cases for two months.

WHO urges investigation of possible early cases

The recent discovery that a man in France was possibly infected before the virus was even reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by Chinese authorities has prompted the body to investigate other suspicious cases.

['Ian Sample'],2020-05-05,Genetics in focus after coronavirus deaths of siblings and twins,"Amid the steady stream of stories on the lives lost to coronavirus are cases that stand out as remarkable. In the past month, at least two pairs of twins have died in Britain and two pairs of brothers, all within hours or days of each other. But do the deaths point to genetic factors that make some more likely than others to succumb to the disease?

Most scientists believe that genes play a role in how people respond to infections. A person’s genetic makeup may influence the receptors that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells. How resilient the person is to the infection, their general health, and how the immune system reacts will also have some genetic component.

A team led by Prof Tim Spector, head of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, has reported that Covid-19 symptoms appear to be 50% genetic. But Spector said more work is needed to understand which genes are involved and what difference they make to the course of the disease. “We don’t know if there are genes linked to the receptors or genes linked to how the infection presents,” he said.

Identical twins Katy and Emma Davis, aged 37, died at Southampton general hospital last month. The sisters, who lived together, had underlying health problems and had been ill for some time before they contracted the virus. Another pair of twins, Eleanor Andrews and her sister Eileen, aged 66, died earlier this month. They too lived together and had underlying health conditions.

Two brothers from Newport, Ghulam Abbas, 59, and Raza Abbas, 54, died within hours of each other at Royal Gwent hospital. Another pair of brothers from Luton, Olume Ivowi, 46, and Isi Ivowi, 38, died within days of each other.

“These deaths alert people to the fact that this could be genetic, but when people live together they share an environment as well,” Spector said. The upshot is that twins who live together are more likely to have similar lifestyles and behaviours, from diet and exercise habits to how quickly they seek medical care. Twins are not generally less healthy than the wider population.

Twin deaths made headlines long before the coronavirus struck. When Julian and Adrian Riester died on the same day in Florida in 2011, a cousin of the twin Franciscan monks said it was “confirmation that God favoured them”. But Spector sees the hand of cold statistics at work. “When you look formally at this, you see that twins rarely die at the same time,” he said. “There are billions of people on the planet. One in 70 is a twin and one in 200 is an identical twin.”

Marcus Munafo, professor of biological psychiatry at Bristol University, said reports of twin deaths must be interpreted with caution. Twin deaths are unusual, which makes them newsworthy, but coverage can distort our perceptions. “Salience bias refers to the fact that we tend to focus on information that stands out more, even if it’s not particularly relevant. So we need to be careful not to read too much into events that might stand out for reasons that are not actually related to the issue we’re interested in,” he said.

“When twins or siblings tragically die with Covid-19 that captures our attention, but that doesn’t mean there’s any particular reason to think twins or siblings are at greater risk.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/genetics-in-focus-after-coronavirus-deaths-of-siblings-and-twins
['Hannah Devlin'],2020-05-03,'Happy hypoxia': unusual coronavirus effect baffles doctors,"It is a mystery that has left doctors questioning the basic tenets of biology: Covid-19 patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death.

The phenomenon, known by some as “happy hypoxia” (some prefer the term “silent”) is raising questions about exactly how the virus attacks the lungs and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients.

A healthy person would be expected to have an oxygen saturation of at least 95%. But doctors are reporting patients attending A&E with oxygen percentage levels in the 80s or 70s, with some drastic cases below 50%.

“It’s intriguing to see so many people coming in, quite how hypoxic they are,” said Dr Jonathan Bannard-Smith, a consultant in critical care and anaesthesia at Manchester Royal Infirmary. “We’re seeing oxygen saturations that are very low and they’re unaware of that. We wouldn’t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It’s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.”

Dr Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that while other lung conditions could cause severe hypoxia, these patients would normally appear extremely ill. “With pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn’t be sat up in bed talking to you,” he said. “We just don’t understand it. We don’t know if it’s causing organ damage that we’re not able to detect. We don’t understand if the body’s compensating.”

Charlesworth had a personal experience of the issue while suffering from Covid-19 in March. After becoming unwell with a cough and fever, he spent 48 hours in bed, during which there were signs he was hypoxic, he said. “I was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious. Looking back I probably should’ve come into hospital. I’m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky. But I was probably hypoxic and my brain probably wasn’t working very well.”

He recovered after a few days in bed, but he and others are conscious that not all cases have positive outcomes.

An anaesthetist at a London hospital, who spoke anonymously, recalled one patient who attended A&E saying she felt cold. “When we put the stats probe on her, her saturation was 30% on air,” he said. “We obviously thought that was wrong, as usually patients are likely to have hypoxic cardiac arrests.” But when a blood sample was taken, her blood was very dark and had oxygen levels equivalent to those seen in people acclimatised to high altitudes. The patient was placed on a ventilator and survived for about a week before dying. “I have had a few patients like this,” the doctor said. “Sadly, their outcomes tend to be bad in my experience.”

Conventional medical wisdom is that as oxygen supplies fall, the heart, brain and other vital organs are placed at risk – and the effect is thought to be cumulative. Typically patients would lose consciousness below an oxygen saturation of 75%.

However, it is not the fall in oxygen levels itself that leaves people feeling breathless. Instead, the body senses the rising levels of carbon dioxide that typically occur simultaneously as the lungs are unable to clear gas as efficiently. But in some Covid-19 patients, this response does not appear to be kicking in.

“I don’t think any of us expect that what we’re seeing can be explained by one process,” said Bannard-Smith.

Swelling and inflammation in the lungs is likely to make it difficult for oxygen to enter the bloodstream. There is also emerging evidence that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting. The vessels in the lungs that collect oxygen and transfer it into the wider bloodstream are so tiny they can become blocked with the smallest of clots.

Several clinical trials are looking at whether blood thinners could prevent or treat complications of Covid-19, including respiratory problems and low blood oxygen.

Some have suggested that, since people are often oblivious to falling oxygen levels, those with Covid-19 symptoms or a positive test result should be given pulse oximeters, a simple device that clips on to the finger and can be used to detect oxygen levels at home. However, as yet there is no evidence that early detection of hypoxia would help avoid severe outcomes and Charlesworth said the practicalities would be difficult.

“Transportation of the devices would put more people on the road,” he said. “Then there are issues around people buying them on the internet and whether they [have proper safety certificates] … If you’re at the point of needing your oxygen levels monitored that’s the time to go to hospital.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/happy-hypoxia-unusual-coronavirus-effect-baffles-doctors

An air force vet turned nurse, a 'fireball' prankster: the US health workers who died from Covid-19

America’s healthcare workers are dying. In some states, medical staff account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. From doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics, those most at risk have already helped save thousands of lives.

Not all these medical professionals survive their encounters with patients. Hospitals are overwhelmed, workers lack protective equipment and some staff suffer from underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to this pernicious virus.

Health authorities in the US have no consistent way of tallying the deaths of healthcare workers. As of 14 April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 deaths among health workers – but our reporting shows that is likely a vast undercount.

Lost on the frontline is a collaboration between the Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to document the lives of healthcare workers in the US who die from Covid-19, and to understand why so many are falling victim to the pandemic.

These are some of the first tragic cases. We are creating a database and will investigate and record new cases as this project unfolds.

Place of work: Henry Ford hospital in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 1 April 2020

Lisa Ewald was a nurse to many living things, human and otherwise.

When her neighbor Alexis Fernandez’s border collie had a stomach blockage, Ewald hooked the dog up to an IV four times a day. “She was this dedicated nurse who nursed my dog back to health,” said Fernandez.

Ewald also loved gardening, aerospace and comic book conventions.

Ewald told Fernandez that a patient she had treated later tested positive for Covid-19, and that she was not wearing a mask at the time. Two days after seeing the patient, she got sick. After delays in accessing a test, she learned on 30 March that she was infected with the coronavirus.

A hospital spokesperson acknowledged that staff who treat coronavirus patients have a higher risk of exposure, but said there was “no way to confirm” how a staff person contracted the virus.

On 31 March, Ewald didn’t answer when Fernandez texted her. The next day, Fernandez and a hospital nurse went to her home to check on her and found her unresponsive on the couch.

“I said: ‘Aren’t you going to go take her pulse or anything?’” Fernandez said. “The nurse just said: ‘She’s gone.’”

Scott Geiger wasn’t always enthusiastic about school, but at 16 he brought home a tome the size of two phone books. It was a manual for emergency medical technicians, and he devoured it, said his younger brother, Ben.

Scott was certified as an EMT at 17. He never married or had kids, but did not seem to miss those things.

“He was so focused on being an EMT and helping people in their most vulnerable and desperate moments,” Ben said. “That’s really what made him feel good.”

Geiger loved playing pool each week with friends. He was a loyal New York Jets football fan, content to joke about their follies and watch them lose. He was quiet. And he seemed to have nine lives, his brother said, surviving hospitalizations for epilepsy as a child and blood cancer as an adult.

When the coronavirus began to tear a path through northern New Jersey, he faced his work with resolve. He downplayed his symptoms when he first fell ill, in late March, but wound up spending 17 days on a ventilator before he died. The family has had to mourn separately, with the brothers’ father, who lived with Scott, in quarantine, and their mother confined to her room in a nursing home that has Covid-19 cases.

Her son Josh said she showed her love through practical jokes. “You knew she loved you if she was yelling at you or if she was pranking you,” he said.

“She was very outspoken,” said Charlene Carter, a fellow nurse. “But I later learned that’s a really good quality to have, as a nurse, so you can advocate for your patients and advocate for yourself.”

In March, Yap-Banago treated a patient who later tested positive for Covid-19. Carter said Yap-Banago was not given personal protective equipment because she was not working in an area designed for coronavirus patients. She spent her final days in isolation to protect others.

A spokesperson for HCA Midwest Health said that medical staff received adequate personal protective equipment in line with CDC guidelines.

Josh said she spoke with reverence of her patients and their families. “She was always focused on the family as a whole, and that the family was taken care of, not just the patient in the bed,” he said.

Israel Tolentino Jr, 33

He was an unflappable first responder with an ever-ready smile

Occupation: Emergency medical technician and firefighter

Places of work: Saint Clare’s Health and the Passaic fire department, Passaic, New Jersey

Date of death: 31 March 2020

When Israel Tolentino Jr arrived for his EMT shift one morning in March, he seemed fine. Then he got a headache, and then a fever. He was sent home, said Vito Cicchetti, a director at Saint Clare’s Health.

Izzy, as he was called, was an EMT who fulfilled his dream to become a firefighter. In 2018, the former marine took a job with the Passaic fire department but continued to take shifts at Saint Clare’s.

He was husband to Maria Vazquez, whom he’d met at church, according to nj.com. They had two young children.

Tolentino and his partner worked brutal, 12-hour shifts during the pandemic. They were dispatched to one emergency after another, each typically lasting under an hour but requiring nearly as long to decontaminate their gear and truck.

Izzy died in hospital care. The coronavirus tore through his EMT team. Most eventually recovered. But his friend and co-worker Kevin Leiva also died.

Cicchetti said he missed Izzy’s unflappable, cheerful presence. “No matter how mad you were, he’d come up with a smile and you’d be chuckling to yourself,” he said.

Cicchetti hasn’t replaced either man. “I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet,” he said.

A former bus driver, she became a nurse at age 38

Occupation: Registered nurse

Place of work: New England Baptist hospital, Boston, Massachusetts

Date of death: 12 April 2020

Rose Taldon was just 5ft tall. But when she bellowed their names out the window, her kids ran right home.

“She didn’t take any crap,” said her daughter, Teadris Pope.

Taldon and her husband raised three children on the same street where she grew up, in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood. Strong-willed and commanding respect, she earned a nursing degree while working in public transit for 23 years. Though she could be stern, she was quick to play-fight and tickle her eight grandkids, Pope said.

Taldon was generous: even as she lay in a hospital in April, exhausted from the coronavirus, she arranged to pay bills for an out-of-work friend, her daughter said.

It’s unclear whether Taldon caught the virus at her hospital, which was designated for non-Covid patients. Hospital officials said three patients and 22 staff had tested positive.

At 2am on Easter morning, a doctor offered to go into Taldon’s hospital room and connect Pope to her mother on a video call, since she couldn’t visit in person.

“I just talked until I had no words,” Pope said. “I was just telling her, ‘We’re so proud of you. You worked so hard raising us … You’ve gone through a hell of a fight.’”

An hour later, her mother was gone.

He was the second of his EMT crew to die of Covid-19

Occupation: Emergency medical technician

Place of work: Saint Clare’s Health in Passaic, New Jersey

Date of death: 7 April 2020

When Kevin Leiva died of Covid-19 in early April, it was a second crushing loss to his close-knit team of EMT workers. Their colleague, Israel Tolentino Jr, had died one week before.

“People were scared that everyone was going to die from it,” said Vito Cicchetti, a director at Saint Clare’s Health, where the men worked. “After Izzy died, we all started getting scared for Kevin.”

Leiva, according to an obituary, “was always worried about his crew”. He was proud of his work and said: “Becoming an EMT was an act of God.”

He met his wife, Marina, online while they were in high school. He loved spending time at their home, playing guitar and tending to his tegu lizards, AJ and Blue.

As Covid-19 spread, the station’s three ambulances each handled up to 15 dispatches a shift, roughly twice as many as usual. EMTs often responded to calls continuously, stopping only to clean their personal protective equipment and disinfect the ambulance.

Leiva “always had a joke” that helped to defuse stressful situations and bring his co-workers together, Cicchetti said.

In ministry and rescue missions, ‘he put his all into it’

Occupation: Emergency medical technician

Place of work: Kansas City, Missouri, fire department

Date of death: 13 April 2020

Bill Birmingham Jr remembers the year his father took on a new career. The whole family studied, even acting out scenes to ensure Billy Birmingham Sr, a minister, was ready for his emergency medical technician exam.

“He put his all into it,” the son recalled.

Billy Birmingham passed the test. And from the late 1990s on, he served as an EMT and a minister.

His family rallied again when he pursued a doctorate in pastoral theology, which he earned in 2005. During nearly four decades as a minister, he opened two churches.

“He had a heart for other people,” his son said. “Whatever he could do for other people, he would do it.”

As a fire department EMT, he was exposed to the coronavirus. The cough came in March.

“‘I’m just tired.’ That’s what he kept saying,” his son said. His dad went to the hospital twice. The first time he told the staff about his symptoms and underlying health conditions, then they sent him home.

The second time he arrived in an ambulance. Just over two weeks later, as he lay dying, hospital staff set up a video chat so his family could see him one last time.

Firefighting and ‘helping people’ were in his blood

Occupation: Paramedic and firefighter

Place of work: Terre Haute fire department in Terre Haute, Indiana

Date of death: 12 April 2020

John Schoffstall grew up around firehouses, and it was at his own firehouse in Terre Haute, Indiana, that he was exposed to the coronavirus.

A paramedic and firefighter with the Terre Haute fire department for almost 12 years, Schoffstall died on 12 April at age 41. Glen Hall, the deputy chief, said the department has been responding every day to calls from patients showing symptoms of Covid-19, although investigations by the county health department and his own department determined Schoffstall contracted the virus from another firefighter. Four other firefighters became mildly ill.

Jennifer Schoffstall, his wife of 18 years, said her husband went to the hospital on 28 March.

“His breathing was so bad in the ER, they just decided to keep him,” she said. “He regressed from there.”

Hall said Schoffstall loved spending time with his family; the couple had a 17-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter.

Schoffstall’s father had been a volunteer firefighter, Jennifer said, and her husband signed up for the New Goshen volunteer fire department when he turned 18.

“He loved the fire service and everything about it,” she said. “He loved helping people.”

Date of death: 8 April 2020

“Somos felices.” That was Dr Luis Caldera-Nieves’ signature sign-off after a cesarean section or at the end of a difficult shift. “We’re happy,” he meant, and often, when he was around, it was true.

Caldera-Nieves, a popular OB-GYN, trained scores of doctors and helped bring thousands of babies into the world in his 25 years at the University of Miami and Jackson health systems.

Born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, he worked at an air force base before joining UM, said Dr Jaime Santiago, a longtime co-worker. Caldera-Nieves was so devoted to his patients that he often gave them his private phone number – and his wife’s, Santiago said.

Because he was so jovial, he earned the nickname “the Puerto Rican Santa Claus”, Santiago said.

“He was truly loved and admired by everyone who worked with him, and will be remembered for his humor and never-ending positive energy,” said Dr Jean-Marie Stephan, who trained under Caldera-Nieves.

In a statement, UM and Jackson confirmed Caldera-Nieves died from complications of Covid-19 and said they “grieve the loss of our esteemed and beloved colleague.” He is survived by his wife and six adult children.

‘It’s a nightmare’

Occupation: Firefighter and medical first responder

Place of work: Detroit fire department in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 8 April 2020

Capt Franklin Williams stood at the altar on his wedding day and pretended to hunt for the ring. He patted his chest, then his pockets and looked up at his soon-to-be wife with a “million-dollar smile”.

He was always clowning and “so silly”, said Shanita Williams, his wife, recalling how he always tried to make her laugh. Williams died from complications of the novel coronavirus on 8 April – one month before the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary.

Williams had been on an emergency call with a verified Covid-19 patient before falling ill, according to the Detroit fire department chief, Robert Distelrath. Crews are equipped with personal protective equipment including a gown, N95 mask and gloves, he said.

But it’s easy for a mask to slip – “when you’re giving [chest] compressions, your mask isn’t staying in place all the time,” said Thomas Gehart, president of the Detroit Fire Fighters Association.

When Williams fell sick on 24 March, he moved to his home’s guest bedroom to avoid infecting his wife. He never returned to work.

“I’m thankful and thank God for having him in my life,” Shanita said, adding that she keeps thinking, “it’s a nightmare and I’m going to wake up. But it’s not.”

‘We’re failing miserably without her’

Occupation: Registered nurse

Place of work: Queens hospital center in Queens, New York

Date of death: 5 April 2020

Aleyamma John’s family wanted her to retire. Her husband, John, an MTA transit worker, had stopped working a few years earlier. He and their son Ginu urged her to follow suit. “We told her, ‘I’m sure dad wants to see the world with you – you need to give him that opportunity,’” Ginu said.

She demurred. “I think she found fulfillment in being able to serve,” Ginu said. “She was able to hold people’s hands, you know, even when they were deteriorating and be there for them.” She began her career as a nurse in India 45 years ago; she and her husband emigrated to the United Arab Emirates, where their two sons were born, and moved to New York in 2002.

Ginu said his mother, a devout Christian, found joy in tending to her vegetable garden and doting on her two grandchildren. She cooked dishes from her native India and filled the Long Island home she shared with John, Ginu and Ginu’s family with flowers.

In March, as Queens hospital center began to swell with Covid-19 patients, Aleyamma sent her family of a photo of herself and colleagues wearing surgical hats and masks, but not enough personal protective equipment. Days later she developed a fever and tested positive for the virus. Johnny, Ginu and Ginu’s wife, Elsa, a nurse practitioner, also became ill.

When Aleyamma’s breathing became labored, her family made the difficult decision to call 911. It would be the last time they saw her. “We’re 17 days in, and I feel like we’re failing miserably without her,” Ginu said.

A 9/11 first responder, he answered the call during the pandemic

Occupation: Volunteer emergency medical technician

Place of work: Village of Valley Stream, New York

Date of death: 8 April 2020

Mike Field had a strong sense of civic duty. An emergency medical technician, he was a first responder with the New York fire department (FDNY) on 9/11. He was also a member of his community’s all-volunteer fire department since 1987.

After he retired from FDNY in 2002, he took a job making and posting street signs with his local public works department. He continued to volunteer with Valley Stream’s fire department and mentored the junior fire department. When he wasn’t responding to emergencies or training future emergency technicians he led a Boy Scout troop and volunteered for animal causes.

“Here’s somebody who cares about the community and cares about its people,” said Valley Stream’s mayor, Ed Fare, who had known Mike since the seventh grade.

Stacey Field, his wife, said he found his calling early, after his own father experienced a heart attack. “When the fire department EMTs came and helped his dad, he decided that’s what he wanted to do,” she said.

Their three sons – Steven, 26; Richie, 22; and Jason, 19 – have followed in their father’s footsteps. Steven and Richie are EMTs in New York; Jason plans on training to become one as well. All three volunteer at the same fire station their father did.

In late March, Mike and fellow volunteer responders were called to an emergency involving a patient showing symptoms of Covid-19. Field died on 8 April.

She was just starting on a path to becoming a nurse

Occupation: Nursing assistant

Place of Work: Extended Care hospital of Riverside, California

Date of Death: 5 April 2020

Valeria Viveros was “barely blooming”, developing the skills and ambition to pursue a nursing career, said Gustavo Urrea, her uncle. Working at Extended Care hospital of Riverside was her first job.

Viveros, born in California to Mexican immigrants, grew attached to her patients at the nursing home, bringing them homemade ceviche, Urrea said. About a month ago, as he watched her cook, play and joke with her grandmother, he noticed how much her social skills had grown.

When she would say “Hi, tío,” in her playful, sweet, high-pitched voice, “it was like the best therapy you could have,” Urrea recalled. Viveros, who lived with her parents and two siblings, was enrolled in classes at a community college.

Viveros began to feel sick on 30 March, went to a nearby hospital and was sent home with Tylenol, Urrea said. By 4 April, she was too weak to get out of bed on her own. She left in an ambulance and never came back.

“We’re all destroyed,” he said. “I can’t even believe it.”

On 5 April, county health officials reported a coronavirus outbreak had sickened 30 patients and some staff at the nursing home where she worked. Trent Evans, general counsel for Extended Care, said staffers were heartbroken by her death.

Viveros was “head over heels in love with the residents that she served”, he said. “She was always there for them.”

Place of Work: Signature HealthCARE at Summit Manor, Columbia, Kentucky

Date of Death: 13 April 2020

Pamela Hughes lived her entire life in rural Columbia, Kentucky, but longed for wide, sandy beaches. For vacation, Hughes and her daughter, Brie, 26, eagerly drove 14 hours to Daytona Beach, Florida, or Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

Hughes worked at Summit Manor, a nursing home in Columbia, for 32 years. She knew which residents preferred chocolate milk or applesauce with their medication; she remembered their favorite outfits and colors. Hughes’s usually shy demeanor vanished each December when she and co-worker Angie McAllister built a float for the town’s Christmas parade competition.

“We built 10 floats over 10 years,” McAllister said. “We got second place every year.”

Even after several residents tested positive for the coronavirus, Hughes dismissed her worsening cough as allergies or bronchitis. The nursing home was short on help and she wanted to serve her patients, Brie said.

Days later, the public health department suggested her mother get tested. She tested positive, and her health worsened – food tasted bitter, her fever soared, her hearing dulled. On 10 April, Hughes was taken by ambulance to a hospital, then by helicopter to Jewish hospital in Louisville. Barred from visiting, Brie said goodbye over FaceTime.

Occupation: Registered nurse

Place of work: Omni Continuing Care in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 31 March 2020

James House had a voracious appetite for learning about and a fascination with the human body.

His sister, Catrisha House-Phelps, traces it back to childhood visits to a dialysis center where their father received treatments. “That was what tugged at his heart,” she said. “He just always wanted to know ‘why’.”

House-Phelps said her brother adored his five children, treasured his anatomy and physiology books, and got a kick out of the residents he cared for at Omni Continuing Care. “He thought they were family; he just said they were funny people,” she said. He had hoped to go back to school to become a physician assistant.

House came down with what he thought was the flu in mid-March. His sister said he tried to get tested for Covid-19 but was turned away because he was not showing textbook symptoms and had no underlying health issues. On 31 March, after resting at home for over a week, House returned to work. Hours later, he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.

He texted his sister with updates on his condition. “I’m about to be intubated now,” he wrote. It was the last message he sent her.

Date of death: 7 April 2020

After more than 30 years at one of New York City’s busy public hospitals, Thomas Soto loved his job but was looking forward to retiring, said his son, Jesse Soto, who lived with him. Thomas looked forward to visits with his four-year-old grandson.

“They did everything together,” said Jesse. He often shared meals with the little boy and took him to a local toy store.

At Thomas’s busy station near the emergency room, he greeted patients and took down their information.

“Everybody saw him before their X-rays,” Jesse, 29, said. “He smiled all day, made jokes. He was a kind man.”

As Covid-19 patients began to overwhelm Woodhull and other emergency rooms across the city, Jesse said that at first, his father didn’t have any protective gear. (The hospital did not respond to requests for comment.)

He eventually got a mask. But he soon grew sick, developing a high fever, body aches and a cough. After a week, Soto said, “he couldn’t take it any more”.

He was admitted at Woodhull and died two days later.

Date of death: 7 April 2020

In 2004, Ali Dennis Guillermo, his wife, Romielyn, and their daughter uprooted their lives in the Philippines and moved to New York.

Everything fell into place. The former nursing instructor landed a job at Long Island community hospital, often working in intensive care or the emergency room. He enjoyed the intensity of ER work, his wife said.

As years passed, the couple had two sons and settled into a close-knit Filipino community on Long Island.

He was devoted to his three children.

“He was such a lovely and good father,” Romielyn said.

As Covid-19 emerged, he was assigned to patients who were transitioning out of intensive care. Many of the nurses on his floor had gotten sick, and “everybody was scared,” Romielyn said.

In late March, he began to feel achy, with a fever that soared to 102F (38.9C). Within days, his blood oxygen level plummeted.

His nails turned blue, an effect of low blood oxygen levels, and he asked his wife to take him to the ER. That was the last time they spoke. Guillermo was intubated in the ICU unit where he had worked. Nearly two weeks later, he died.

Gary Sclar was a whip-smart neurologist who loved comic books, Game of Thrones and Star Wars, said his daughter, Jennifer Sclar. He was deeply compassionate with a blunt bedside manner.

“My dad was fascinated with the brain and with science,” Jennifer Sclar said. “His work was his passion, and it’s what made him the happiest, besides my brother and me.” Set to retire in June, he was looking forward to writing about politics and neurology.

Gary Sclar saw patients who were showing Covid-19 symptoms and knew his age and underlying health conditions – he had diabetes – put him at risk for developing complications from the illness. His daughter pleaded with him to stop going in to the hospital.

In early April, he mentioned having lost his sense of smell, and on 8 April, he collapsed in his home. He was hospitalized a few days later and agreed to be intubated. “I don’t think he realized like that this was the end,” Sclar said. “He brought his keys. He brought his wallet.”

Rose Harrison lived to serve others – her husband, three daughters, grandchildren and the residents of the nursing home where she worked. Though the Alabama nurse was selfless, she also had a sassy edge to her personality and was given to fits of pique behind the wheel, her daughter, Amanda Williams said.

“Her personality was so funny, you automatically loved her,” Williams said. “She was so outspoken. If she didn’t agree with you, she’d tell you in a respectful way.”

Williams was not wearing a mask when she cared for a patient who later tested positive for Covid-19 at Marion Regional nursing home in Hamilton, Alabama, her daughter said. She later developed a cough, fatigue and a low-grade fever, but kept reporting to duty all week. Officials from the nursing home did not return calls for comment.

On 3 April, Williams drove her mother to a hospital. The following evening, Harrison discussed the option of going on a ventilator with loved ones on a video call, agreeing it was the best course. Williams believed that her mother fully expected to recover.

Monica Echeverri Casarez was in constant motion, said her husband, Jorge Casarez. The daughter of Colombian immigrants, she worked as a Spanish-English interpreter in clinical settings. She was the kind of person whose arrival at a mom-and-pop restaurant would elicit hugs from the owners. She also co-founded Southwest Detroit Restaurant Week, a not-for-profit that supports local businesses.

Twice a month, she scrubbed in as a surgical technician at Harper University hospital. “She liked discovering the beauty of how the body works and how science is clear and orderly,” Casarez said. She was organized and intuitive, qualities that are assets in the operating room.

On 21 March, she posted a photo of herself in protective gear with the caption: “I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t at least a bit nervous to be there now.” Since many elective surgeries had been canceled, Echeverri Casarez was tasked with taking the temperatures of people who walked into the hospital and making sure their hands were sterilized.

Soon after, Echeverri Casarez and Casarez began feeling ill. Quarantined together, Echeverri Casarez tried to make the best of the situation. She baked her husband a cake – chocolate with white frosting. She died a few days later.

Date of death: 31 March 2020

Kim King-Smith was a natural caregiver. An only child, she grew up close to her extended family, including her cousins Hassana Salaam-Rivers and Sharonda Salaam. After Salaam developed multiple sclerosis, King-Smith visited her every day.

“She’d bring her sweets that she wasn’t supposed to have and share them with her,” Salaam-Rivers said. King-Smith’s desire to care for others was the reason she became an electrocardiogram technician, her cousin added. “If a friend of a friend or family member went to the hospital, she would always go and visit them as soon as her shift was over,” she said.

In March, King-Smith cared for a patient she said had symptoms of Covid-19; she soon fell ill herself and tested positive for the virus. It seemed like a mild case at first, and she stayed in touch with family via FaceTime while trying to isolate from her husband, Lenny.

On 29 March, Salaam-Rivers checked in on her cousin and noticed she was struggling to breathe. She urged her to call an ambulance. After King-Smith was hospitalized, she exchanged text messages with her mother and cousin. As the day progressed, her messages carried increasingly grave news, Salaam-Rivers said.

Date of death: 23 March 2020

At a shelter for adults recovering from addiction, residents looked forward to the days when Marion “Curtis” Hunt would take the stage, emceeing talent shows and belting out Broadway and gospel tunes.

It wasn’t part of his job description as a social worker. It was just one of the ways he went “above and beyond”, said Daena Murphy, his supervisor at Cornell Scott-Hill health center. “He had a beautiful voice,” she said. “He was just a wonderful person – funny, engaging, always a huge smile on his face.”

Hunt, the youngest of four brothers, earned his master’s in social work from Fordham University at 52, and was baptized at his brother’s Pentecostal church at 54. He was a devoted uncle who doted on his dog and cat, Mya and Milo.

It’s unclear how Hunt got infected, but one patient he worked with tested positive for Covid-19, as did two co-workers, according to Dr Ece Tek, another supervisor at Cornell Scott-Hill health center. Hunt died on 23 March, one week after developing flu-like symptoms, said his brother John Mann Jr.

Date of death: 27 March 2020

For Jhoanna Mariel Buendia, her aunt was a constant – if distant – presence. Araceli Buendia Ilagan emigrated from their hometown Baguio, in the Philippines, to the US before Buendia was born, but she remained close to her family and communicated with them nearly every day.

“She was one of the smartest people I ever knew,” Buendia, 27, said. Buendia Ilagan, who at one point looked into adopting her niece so she could join her and her husband the United States, encouraged Buendia to become a nurse, and talked her through grueling coursework in anatomy and physiology. Buendia is now a nurse in London.

Buendia Ilagan was also demanding. “Whenever she visited the Philippines, she wanted everything to be organized and squeaky clean,” Buendia said.

The last time the two spoke, in late March, Buendia Ilagan didn’t mention anything about feeling ill. Instead, the two commiserated over their experiences of treating patients with Covid-19; as always, her aunt offered her advice on staying safe while giving the best possible care. She died four days later.

Occupation: Geriatric psychiatrist

Place of work: Christ hospital and CarePoint health in Jersey City, New Jersey

Date of death: 8 April 2020

Dr Leo Dela Cruz was nervous about going to work in the weeks before he died, his friends said. Like many in the region, Christ hospital had an influx of Covid-19 patients and faced a shortage of ventilators and masks.

Dela Cruz was a geriatric psychiatrist and didn’t work in coronavirus wards. But he continued to see patients in person. In early April, Dela Cruz, who lived alone, complained only of migraines, his friends said. Within a week his condition worsened, and he was put on a ventilator at a nearby hospital. He died soon after.

Friends said he may have been exposed at the hospital. (In a statement, hospital representatives said he didn’t treat Covid-19 patients.)

Dela Cruz, the oldest of 10 siblings, came from a family of healthcare professionals. His friends and family – from Cebu, Philippines, to Teaneck, New Jersey – remembered his jovial personality on Facebook. He won “best doctor of the year” awards, played tennis, and cooked traditional Cebu dishes.

Nida Gonzales, a colleague, said he always supported people, whether funding a student’s education or running a church mental health program. “I feel like I lost a brother,” she said.

Verrier was so committed to fighting the virus, he called into work meetings even after he got sick

Occupation: Surgeon

Place of work: St Barnabas hospital in the Bronx, New York

Date of death: 8 April 2020

Dr J Ronald Verrier spent the final weeks of his life tending to a torrent of patients infected with Covid-19. Workers at St Barnabas hospital struggled to find masks and gowns as staff set up makeshift morgues in the parking lot. (Many nurses continue to make cloth masks.)

Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Verrier emigrated to the United States and had worked at St Barnabas for the last two decades, overseeing the general surgery residency program.

A towering presence with a wide, dimpled smile, Verrier was a natural mentor who was known to drop into patients’ rooms for impromptu birthday parties.

“He kept pushing me forward,” said Dr Christina Pardo, Verrier’s cousin and an obstetrician and gynecologist in New York. “I would call him and say, ‘I swear I failed that test,’ and he would laugh. He was my confidence when I didn’t have it.”

The Verrier family stretches across continents and Verrier kept them close, zipping around to a niece’s wedding in Belgium, a baptism in Florida and another wedding in Montreal in recent years. He had recently ferried medical supplies to Haiti, a decade after he had traveled to his homeland to tend to victims of the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake.

Verrier helped steer St Barnabas’s efforts to increase its capacity as Covid-19 cases increased. “He was at the hospital every day,” Dr Ridwan Shabsigh, the surgery department’s chair, said. “This was a nonstop effort.”

In early April, Verrier discovered he was infected. After developing symptoms, he continued to call into meetings from his home in Woodmere, New York. Shabsigh spoke with Verrier on 7 April, and said his spirits were high. The next day, he was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died.

Vianna Thompson, 52

Thompson texted from the bedroom: ‘Call the ambulance, I can hardly breathe’

Occupation: Nurse

Place of work: VA Sierra Nevada health care system and Northern Nevada medical center in Reno, Nevada

Date of death: 7 April 2020

In late March, Vianna Thompson spent two night shifts caring for a co-worker who was suffering from Covid-19. Two weeks later, she was lying in an intensive care unit, with a colleague holding her hand.

Thompson and Bruce McAllister, the man she treated, were among three VA healthcare workers in Reno, Nevada, who died within a two-week span from the novel coronavirus.

“It’s pretty devastating. It’s surreal. Reno’s not that big of a city,” said Robyn Underhill, a night nurse who worked with Thompson.

Thompson was born Vianna Fye in Port Huron, Michigan. She met her husband, Bob, in 1991 on the Osan airbase in South Korea, where she was a veterinary technician and cared for military police dogs. They bonded over two-step dancing and country music.

Vianna was a proud mother who worked long hours to provide for her three sons, buying them saxophones, drums and keyboards so they could play jazz and country music.

“She was just sweet, big-hearted, caring, unselfish,” Bob Thompson said. Vianna came to work with a cough on 29 March, a day after McAllister died. ”We were all very concerned,” Underhill said. “Call it intuition, call it ‘Spidey sense’, but I knew that moment that she was coughing that this was not going to end well.”

That shift was Thompson’s last. Over the next four days, she wrestled with fever, weakness and shortness of breath. The following Thursday, she texted her husband from the bedroom: “Call the ambulance, I can hardly breathe.”

She was taken to the VA hospital and put on a ventilator. On 17 March, as her organs began to fail, Thompson’s colleagues connected to Bob on FaceTime so he could say goodbye.

As a veteran, she qualified for an “honor flight”, in which the patient’s body is covered with a black box and wheeled through the hospital while others line up and salute. Because of the infectious nature of the coronavirus, a US flag could not be safely draped over her body, so a family friend walked in front of her and carried it.

Thompson said the ceremony drew more people lining the hallways than staff had seen in 20 years. “God’s getting a hell of a nurse,” he said.

Alvin Simmons, 54

After some struggles, Simmons turned his life around

Occupation: Environmental service assistant

Place of work: Rochester general hospital in Rochester, New York

Date of death: 17 March 2020

Alvin Simmons started working as a custodian at Rochester general hospital, in New York state, only weeks before he fell ill. “He loved helping people and he figured the best place to do that would be in a hospital,” his sister Michelle Wilcox said.

An army veteran who had served in the first Gulf war, Simmons loved karaoke and doted on his three grandchildren, Wilcox said. “He was a dedicated, hard-working individual who had just changed his life around” since a prison stint, she said.

According to Wilcox, Simmons began developing symptoms shortly after cleaning the room of a woman he believed was infected with the novel coronavirus. (In an email, a hospital spokesperson said it had “no evidence to suggest that Mr Simmons was at a heightened risk of exposure to Covid-19 by virtue of his training or employment duties” and that he was the hospital’s first diagnosed case of Covid-19.)

On 11 March, he visited the emergency room with flu-like symptoms, Wilcox said. Over the next few days, his breathing became more labored and he began to cough up blood. He was rushed to the hospital on 13 March, where he subsequently received a Covid-19 diagnosis. Simmons died on 17 March.

Daisy Doronila, 60

Doronila was among dozens of people infected with the coronavirus at a Hudson county jail

Occupation: Nurse

Place of work: Hudson county correctional facility in Kearny, New Jersey

Date of death: 5 April 2020

Daisy Doronila treated her patients at the Hudson county correctional facility, a New Jersey prison, with the utmost kindness, no matter what they had done.

“There would be people there for the most heinous crimes,” said her daughter, Denise Rendor, 28, “but they would just melt towards my mother because she really was there to give them care with no judgment.”

Doronila emigrated from the Philippines as a young nurse. She loved fashionable clothes and eating seafood on the waterfront in New York City, her daughter said.

“Daisy could handle herself,” said the county director of corrections, Ron Edwards, describing her as sophisticated, intelligent and compassionate. “If someone got obnoxious with her, she’d put them in their place and call for help if she needed to.”

Like many jails and prisons, the facility where Doronila worked has been hit hard by the virus: as of 10 April, 27 inmates and 68 staff members had tested positive. Four people who worked at the jail, including Doronila, have died, according to officials.

Doronila, a devout Catholic who had been planning a trip to Israel with friends from church, developed a cough in mid-March. One doctor told her she probably had strep throat; another said fever wasn’t high enough to merit a coronavirus test.

She offered to return to work, but as the days went by, her condition grew worse. On 21 March, she was hospitalized for shortness of breath. The next day, she was put on a ventilator. Two weeks later, she passed away.

Rendor said she and her mother were looking forward to sharing the next chapters in life together. For her mother, retirement at 65. For Rendor, marriage and perhaps starting her own family.

“It was about to get really, really good,” she said.

Jeff Baumbach.

Jeff Baumbach, 57

Unable to gather to mourn, Baumbach’s friends drove by his house shining flashlights in his honor

Occupation: Nurse

Place of work: St Joseph’s medical center in Stockton, California

Date of death: 31 March 2020

Jeff Baumbach knew the risks of coronavirus, but as a nurse for 28 years he was also accustomed to being around infectious disease. “He’d worked in the ICU. He was exposed to so many things, and we never got anything,” said his wife and fellow nurse, Karen. Baumbach even sent a dry text to Karen: “I love wearing a mask every day.”

In March, Baumbach was notified that a co-worker had Covid-19. He soon began to develop symptoms; he and Karen tested positive. Karen came down with body aches and congestion. Jeff had a fever and cough.

Their home, once the site of countless family brunches and barbecues, where Jeff and his children solved huge jigsaw puzzles, was now sealed off from the outside world. Their daughter Kaila, 26, moved out as a precaution, and she didn’t communicate with her dad when he was sick. “I thought he was invincible,” Kaila said.

On 26 March, Karen brought Baumbach to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia. He chose to recuperate at home. On 31 March, he collapsed in the bathroom. “It went downhill really fast,” said Karen, who took him to the hospital. Unable to enter the building, she stayed in her car and received updates by phone. Kaila waited in another car nearby.

Baumbach was connected to a ventilator, but it had little effect. Eventually, Karen was allowed to don full protective gear and say goodbye in person. She returned home alone, still in quarantine.

The next evening, Kaila asked dozens of friends and family members to drive along her parents’ street and shine their phone flashlights. Filled with grief and gratitude, Karen cried as she peered out of an upstairs window at the glittering lines of cars crawling in both directions past her home.

Debbie Accad, 72

Accad was the ‘pillar’ of her family back in the Philippines and spent decades caring for US veterans

Occupation: Clinical nursing coordinator

Place of work: Detroit VA medical center in Detroit, Michigan

Date of death: 30 March 2020

Nurse Divina “Debbie” Accad cared for military veterans for over 25 years and was just a few weeks from retiring when the virus struck.

On 16 March, Accad, 72, a clinical nursing coordinator at the Detroit VA medical center, told relatives that she felt ill. Four days later, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. She told her family that she had tested positive for Covid-19, and asked them to pray for her. The family felt helpless watching their beloved matriarch suffer from afar, said her niece, April Amada, who lives in the Philippines.

Accad was born in Alimodian, a Philippine town known for its sweet bananas. The eldest of four children, she graduated from Central Philippine University with a nursing degree in 1969.

Two years later, she moved to Chicago through a “fly now, pay later” program, joining tens of thousands of Filipino nurses who have migrated to the United States. She later relocated to Taylor, Michigan, where she married William Accad, with whom she raised four children.

Accad was the “pillar of the family”, Amada said. She sent money home to relatives, and put Amada’s mother through nursing school. A visit from Accad – known to relatives as Tita Debbie – meant unli-kainan, or “unlimited food”. Accad served up big American breakfasts and spicy kielbasa with cabbage.

Mark, Accad’s son, said his mother had diabetes, a risk factor for Covid-19 complications. He believes his mother was exposed by infected co-workers, though that has not been confirmed. The Department of Veterans Affairs is facing serious shortages in personal protective equipment for workers, according to internal memos obtained by the Wall Street Journal, though the VA has told reporters that it was taking proper precautions.

Accad “died doing what she loved most – caring for people”, said Mark.

['Jessica Glenza'],2020-05-05,New York reports 15 cases of rare illness in children possibly linked to Covid-19,"More than 100 cases of unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries as 15 New York patients aged two to 15 hospitalized

New York City’s health department has reported 15 cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that may be linked to coronavirus infections.

More than 100 cases of the unusual illness have now emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland investigating the condition.

Fifteen patients aged between two and 15 were hospitalized between 29 April and 3 May with illnesses compatible with the syndrome, the New York City health department said in a statement. “All patients had subjective or measured fever and more than half reported rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea,” it added.

No deaths were reported.

More cases of rare syndrome in children reported globally Read more

The syndrome resembles Kawasaki disease, authorities said, an inflammatory condition of the blood vessels in which children develop high fever, rash on the back, chest and abdomen, bloodshot eyes, swollen hands and feet, swollen lymph glands and swelling around the mouth and lips.

Kawasaki disease is rare. About 3,000 children are diagnosed with the disease each year. There are 74 million children younger than 18 in the US.

The cause of Kawasaki disease is not known, although some research papers have linked its trigger to viral infection. It was first diagnosed in Japanese children in the 1960s and does not appear to be either contagious or hereditary, according to the American Heart Association.

The New York City health department ordered pediatricians whose patients have a fever for four days or more, symptoms consistent with Kawasaki disease or symptoms similar to toxic shock syndrome to report the cases immediately, for all patients younger than 15. The health department also urged pediatricians to refer patients to infectious disease specialists or rheumatologists.

It remains unclear what connection the disease might have to Sars-Cov-2, the coronavirus which causes Covid-19, and has hit New York City particularly hard. All 15 of the children were tested for Covid-19. Ten were negative.

Although children can spread the coronavirus, they are much less likely to contract it, and it has relatively mild effects on them. In its warning about the inflammatory condition, the UK’s Pediatric Intensive Care Society said: “Serious illness as a result of Covid-19 still appears to be a very rare event in children.”

However, since the pandemic, doctors have noted patients with Kawasaki disease who also have Covid-19. The earliest known case involved a six-month-old in California, who came to the hospital with symptoms of Kawasaki disease and was also diagnosed with Covid-19. The case report was peer-reviewed and is expected to be published in the journal Hospital Pediatrics.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/children-coronavirus-illness-new-york-rare-cases
['Oliver Milman'],2020-05-05,Wendy's pulls burgers off the menu at some locations due to meat shortage,"As many as one in five restaurants in the giant Wendy’s fast-food chain across the US has had to stop serving hamburgers or other beef-based menu items, in the latest sign of an escalating threat of a national meat shortage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Wendy’s customers in various US locations have reported being unable to purchase burgers at restaurants belonging to one of the world’s largest hamburger chains. The fast-food company has confirmed it is experiencing problems with beef suppliers and that “some of our menu items may be temporarily limited at some restaurants in this current environment”.

About 1,000 Wendy’s restaurants, a fifth of the company’s American outlets, are not serving burgers and other beef dishes, according to financial analyst firm Stephens. Some states are particularly affected, with restaurants in Ohio, Michigan and New York running extremely low on fresh meat, while other states such as Arizona and Nevada aren’t as badly hit.

Wendy’s meatless woes are a symptom of a broader slowdown in America’s meat production as thousands of workers in processing plants fall sick from Covid-19 and facilities shutter due to fears of further spread of the virus.

Donald Trump attempted to rectify the situation by signing an executive order on 28 April that aims to keep meat-processing plants in operation. But the order is not expected to resolve the slowdown as it won’t protect workers from a highly contagious disease spreading in the crowded environs of a processing facility.

Dozens of workers have already died from Covid-19, according to unions, with many employees expressing fear that they are on the frontline of a dangerous coronavirus hotspot.

Tyson Foods, one of America’s largest meat producers, said its output of pork is down by 50% despite measures it claims it has taken to physically distance workers and ensure the supply of meat. The company recently took out a full-page advert in the New York Times to warn that the “food supply chain is breaking” due to a highly unusual situation where both the production and distribution of meat has been crippled by a public health emergency.

Over the past month, Tyson has closed three major plants in Iowa and one in Indiana after huge numbers of employees fell sick from Covid-19. Its beef-processing operations in Washington state and Nebraska have also shut down after a spate of infections.

A weekly report from the US Department of Agriculture on 27 April illustrated the national decline in meat output, with beef production down 25% on the same period last year, while pork production slumped 15%. This shortfall will lead to price increases in some restaurants and stores and shortages in others, analysts said.

“You’re going to see empty shelves,” Steve Meyer, an economist for agricultural risk management firm Kerns and Associates, told the Washington Post. “Not all the time, and it won’t last forever.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/wendys-burgers-beef-meat-shortage-coronavirus
['Mario Koran'],2020-05-05,Co-living in a pandemic: how I'm surviving life with 48 roommates,"With Bay Area rent soaring, Mario Koran moved to Starcity, where kitchens and bathrooms are shared. Is socially distancing possible in ‘a college dorm for grown-ups’?

I’m living with 48 roommates in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Co-living makes physical distancing all but impossible: we touch the same door handles, awkwardly navigate shared spaces and binge-watch Tiger King in the same TV lounges.

The fear of coronavirus hasn’t so far driven me to move out or reignite a grueling apartment search. But neither can I say with authority just how safe co-living is in the middle of an outbreak.

Before I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in September, I was aware of the region’s reputation for towering costs of living. But I wasn’t prepared for the grinding hustle to find affordable housing. Even renting a room in someone else’s apartment felt more like a job interview with prospective roommates.

'With restrictions easing, how do we tell someone we don’t want them in our bubble?' Read more

I bounced between temporary rooms until I could find a more permanent place, living out of a suitcase, storing frozen meals in strangers’ refrigerators. At one point, I was willing to take a partitioned-off section of a living room someone was renting as a bedroom for $1,500. No dice: the tenants decided to “move in another direction” in terms of a roommate.

When I found Starcity – a tech-enabled real estate company that’s part of a new generation of co-living spaces – it was, by all measures, an improvement to my living situation. It looks and feels a lot like a college dorm for grown-ups. The building is clean and well-lit, with a low-key, budget-trendy style. Beds and kitchen appliances are new. Showers don’t inexplicably scald or give me frostbite. Laundry, soap and internet fees are included in rent. My room is my own space. The flexible lease was a major selling point and the price was right, too.

My apartment in Oakland rents for $1,250 a month – about $600 less than the median rent for a studio in Oakland and about $1,000 less than a typical one-bedroom.

This is how, at the age of 38, I effectively returned to my freshman year of college. I made a new group of pals and began to settle in. Then came the coronavirus.

Is it possible to protect yourself?

In spite of the pandemic, new residents continue to move into Starcity. But I’ve also seen a good number of residents leaving with packed bags – some for good, others planning to wait out the worst of the pandemic with friends or family.

A couple of weeks ago, one woman sent me a message asking if I had any intel on penalties for breaking the lease. She couldn’t do this co-living situation, she wrote, especially during Covid-19. Days later, she was gone.

Roshan Ramankutty, a software engineer in the sales department of Square who has become a friend, decided the best option for him is living with nearby family members.

“For me, it came down to: if the worst case scenario was to happen, how would I best be able to support and be supported? And that’s ultimately with my family,” he said.

Jon Dishotksy, Starcity’s 36-year-old CEO and co-founder, says the company has received only a half-dozen lease cancellations since the lockdowns started. One Starcity staff member tested positive for Covid-19, he said, but so far there have been no known outbreaks in Starcity communities.

In a co-living environment, refrigerator handles, faucets and elevator buttons are all common touch-points. Even a trip to the kitchen to fetch a cup of coffee could put you in close proximity to your neighbors.

So is it actually possible to protect yourself from an outbreak in a place like Starcity?

Paula Cannon, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, agrees that co-living certainly isn’t ideal during a pandemic but says there are ways to minimize risk.

“If I was living there as a virologist, I would be your very annoying neighbor sticking leaflets under people’s doors that say ‘here’s what Starcity is doing’ and ‘here’s what we can do as neighbors’,” she said.

Cannon suggests, for example, creating a schedule for the kitchen, so residents can space out meal times and reduce exposure to others. Cleaning and disinfecting the kitchen before and after each use would help. So would making your bedroom your castle and keeping to it as much as possible.

That, she says, requires residents to buy into a shared contract and agree to do their part to protect themselves and their neighbors.

Health guidance aside, sheltering in place at Starcity hasn’t always been convenient. Under lockdown, mail and packages to our building have stopped.

Dishotsky explains that receiving packages has been a challenge across Starcity communities, partly because they repurpose underused hotels or commercial spaces that lack places to store packages.

Weekdays see my neighbors waiting by its front door for deliveries for hours on end. Many packages have been rerouted, delayed, or stopped altogether. Hand-drawn notes decorate our front door, reminding delivery drivers: “THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A sign aimed at delivery drivers. Photograph: Mario Koran/The Guardian

It’s a small issue compared with the grim toll coronavirus has taken elsewhere. But it’s a valid concern at a time when deliveries remain one of the few ways for people to buy essentials.

So far, there’s been no groundswell among residents to adopt a kitchen schedule like the one Cannon suggests, but that could change should someone in the building get sick.

While some residents have been keeping more to their rooms – emerging only occasionally, and with increasing edginess, to use the kitchen or shower – others see roommates as members of a traditional household and have given up trying to maintain six feet of separation.

Even Cannon recognizes that self-isolating at all times could defeat the fundamental benefit of group quarantine.

Sensor taps and no door handles: Covid-19 shows it's time to rethink public toilets Read more

“Part of the draw of places like this is the sense of community, which helps people who have become near-suicidal because of isolation,” she says.

Indeed, having roommates has been instrumental in helping me beat back the madness that encroaches after days of solitude.

We’ve passed time in childish and inane ways, spending nights eating Pringles and playing video games. We put on Pink Floyd albums and shot hoops at the downstairs basketball court until the wee hours of the morning. Suppertime sees a small troop of us rallying behind João, a Brazilian restaurant manager who’s been laid off during the outbreak but continues to cook for those of us dug into the trenches of co-living alongside him.

And lockdown has shown me – as a hopeless introvert – how much I’ve come to appreciate having, even need, others around.

The housing model of the future?

Dishotsky, who helped launch Starcity in 2016, grew up just south of San Francisco, in Silicon Valley’s Palo Alto. His father, a Stanford professor, rented out rooms to students, rooting his son in co-living early on.

After a decade in commercial real estate, Dishotsky said he wanted to create something to help meet the Bay Area’s most pressing need: a healthy stock of affordable housing options.

“I saw a way to make a dent in the housing supply and keep it affordable so a city doesn’t push out its restaurant servers, postal workers, journalists – the ones who make up the backbone and underlying culture of our cities,” Dishotsky explains.

Over the years, Starcity has been featured in the New York Times, SF Curbed and CityLab, with stories exploring the degree to which a concept that once seemed absurd – a group of adults living together like college students – could be an answer to the lack of affordable housing.

It’s also been subject to skepticism. In 2016 a local news outlet described Starcity as taking advantage of a loophole in city regulations that allows developers to buy single-room occupancy hotels, or SROs, flip them, then raise rents from, say, $450 to $2,100 a month at one San Francisco location.

“That was before we understood the full impact of converting SROs,” Dishotsky says of the criticism, adding that Starcity allowed previous residents at that address to continue to rent at the prices they paid before the building was renovated.

Since then, Dishotsky has been outspoken on the issue of displacement, writing in 2018 op-ed that he refuses to purchase or manage buildings that previously served low-income residents and calling on other developers to do the same.

Dishotsky believes Starcity’s model is resilient enough to outlast the pandemic, even as companies like WeWork, which offers shared office spaces, looks to scale back communal areas moving forward.

He sees co-living as a model of the future – one that will one day be embraced not just by single adults but whole families attracted to communal living and shared childcare.

As CEO, Dishotsky’s optimism isn’t surprising. But Cannon, as a virologist, backs him up.

“I would be wary of attributing too much to how much coronavirus will change society. We have very short memories. Once we get a vaccine, and we will, people will re-emerge and things will go, mostly, back to normal,” Cannon says.

The silver lining, Cannon said, could be getting residents to embrace the social contract of taking precautions to look out for their neighbors’ health as well as their own.

“These things build trust and a sense of community,” she says. “It’s the underlying human experiences that will ultimately get us through this moment.”

As for me, I don’t plan to stay at Starcity forever. The lockdown will eventually pass and one day I might even find a place to settle down. Until then, I’m leaning into the moment – even if that looks a lot like it did when I was when I was 19 years old.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/co-living-coronavirus-roommates-starcity
['Heather Stewart'],2020-05-05,UK coronavirus adviser Neil Ferguson resigns after breaking lockdown rules,"Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling helped shape Britain’s coronavirus lockdown strategy, has quit as a government adviser after flouting the rules by receiving visits from his lover at his home.

Ferguson runs the group of scientists at Imperial College London whose projections helped persuade ministers of the need to impose stringent physical distancing rules, or risk the NHS being overwhelmed.

In a statement on Tuesday, he said he was resigning his post on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), over an “error of judgment”.

The Daily Telegraph revealed that Antonia Staats had crossed London from her family home to visit him on at least two occasions since lockdown measures were imposed, on 30 March and 8 April. Friends told the newspaper that Staats did not believe their actions to be hypocritical because she considered the households to be one.

The visits clearly contravene the government’s “stay at home, save lives” message, which urges people to remain within their family groups and not mix with members of other households.

“I accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in Sage,” Ferguson said. “I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms.

“I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.”

Government advisers have repeatedly warned the public against meetings with members of other households. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, when asked whether partners living separately could visit each other, said on 24 March: “If the two halves of a couple are currently in separate households, ideally they should stay in those households.”

She added: “The alternative might be that, for quite a significant period going forwards, they should test the strength of their relationship and decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.”

Ferguson had become a familiar figure in media interviews during the lockdown, helping to explain the scientific rationale for government decision-making. He contracted the virus in mid-March, apparently after attending meetings in Westminster.

“Sigh. Developed a slight dry but persistent cough yesterday and self-isolated even though I felt fine. Then developed high fever at 4am today. There is a lot of Covid-19 in Westminster,” he tweeted on 18 March.

Ferguson’s resignation follows questions over the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, who travelled to one of his homes outside his constituency to spend lockdown there, and drove to his parents’ house to drop off food and medicines.

Colleagues have described Ferguson, 51 – whose background is in modelling rather than medicine – as a workaholic.

His colleague Christl Donnelly told the Guardian earlier this year: “He works harder than anyone I have ever met. He is simultaneously attending very large numbers of meetings while running the group from an organisational point of view and doing programming himself. Any one of those things could take somebody their full time.

“One of his friends said he should slow down – this is a marathon not a sprint. He said he is going to do the marathon at sprint speed. It is not just work ethic – it is also energy. He seems to be able to keep going. He must sleep a bit, but I think not much.”

Staats, 38, is believed to work for an activism organisation.

Imperial’s modelling claimed that as many as 500,000 deaths could result in the UK from the Covid-19 outbreak if the government failed to implement stringent enough distancing measures, and Ferguson warned recently that lifting lockdown prematurely could cost 100,000 lives.

A government spokesman confirmed Ferguson’s resignation but did not comment further.

A statement from Imperial College London said Ferguson “continues to focus on his important research”.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules

His resignation is a huge blow to the government’s authority on the pandemic.

It was his work that prompted a seismic shift in government policy in the UK response from essentially letting the virus spread through the population to the wholescale stay-at-home policy now in place.

The evidence that changed the government’s policy came from the centre he founded with colleagues at Imperial College, the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, which collaborates with the World Health Organization.

His decision to resign from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), after allowing his lover to visit him at home during the lockdown while lecturing the public on the need for strict social distancing, will leave a gaping hole for ministers to fill.

The high-profile figures who got into hot water over lockdown rules Read more

Ferguson, 51, had only just finished a two-week spell self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus before being confronted by the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday.

It will be a crushing fall for the slim, bespectacled, intense workaholic whose face has become a familiar sight on television screens over the past six weeks.

As head of the department at Imperial College London since 2012 Ferguson carries with him 20 years of experience of studying pathogen outbreaks – foot and mouth disease in 2001, Sars in 2003, swine flu in 2011, Mers in 2012, and Ebola and Zika in 2014.

He modelled the spread of all those outbreaks, advising five UK prime ministers in the process. But all that seems like a practice run for 2020.

In February data began emerging from northern Italy, the first place in Europe to feel the force of the novel coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in November.

“This virus is probably the one that concerns me the most, of everything I’ve worked on,” Ferguson said in an early TV interview mid-February, when ministers were still focused on how they would implement Brexit.

On 16 March, about a month after the earlier interview, Ferguson delivered a 20-page paper to Johnson which transformed the UK’s strategy and has been credited with saving tens of thousands of lives.

He told ministers that more than 500,000 people could die if the government continued with its stated strategy of allowing the disease to spread.

Eight days later, the government scrapped the strategy in favour of suppressing the virus with a lockdown to save lives and protect the NHS.

Ferguson’s work has gone on to form the strategies pursued by the White House, in the US, and the governments of France and Germany, according to reports.

He is dedicated to his profession, according to his colleague Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology based at Oxford University most of the time, as well as at Imperial. She said: “He works harder than anyone I have ever met. He is simultaneously attending very large numbers of meetings while running the group from an organisational point of view and doing programming himself. Any one of those things could take somebody their full time.

Ferguson was one of a number of people at the highest levels of government to contract the virus. On 17 March, he took part in a 5pm press conference at No 10 Downing Street, greeting senior members of Johnson’s cabinet before delivering a speech and leaving.

The next morning he woke with a dry cough and tested positive for Covid-19. In the days that followed, the prime minister, his chief adviser Dominic Cummings, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, also reported symptoms of the virus.

In a statement on Tuesday, Ferguson expressed his regret for ignoring the government’s guidance.

“I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic,” he said.

The World Health Organization has urged countries to look for more early cases of Covid-19 and urged a full exploration of the pandemic’s origins and early path, as Germany took preventive action to head off any future rise in infections.

Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state Read more

As European countries continued to ease their lockdown restrictions, the WHO said news that a French hospital re-testing old samples from pneumonia patients had identified a coronavirus infection dating to 27 December, weeks before France confirmed its first cases, “gives us a whole new picture on everything”.

A spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, urged more countries to look for other early incidences of the virus, which was first reported by Chinese authorities to the WHO on 31 December and not previously thought to have spread to Europe until January.

“The findings help to better understand the potential virus circulation,” Lindmeier said, adding that it was “really, really important” to gain a fuller understanding of the early path of the virus and that further WHO missions to China may be needed.

Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said the country – one of the few in Europe not to impose a mandatory lockdown – would not carry out retrospective testing yet, but also called for a full investigation of how the virus spread in China.

It was important to know “how it behaved in the early stages of its spread”, Tegnell told Sweden’s TT news agency, particularly “if it it was an individual spread from an animal to a person, or if it spread to a group of people over a longer period of time.”

The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has alleged the Trump administration has “evidence” that the virus emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, but scientists have advised the WHO that it is of animal origin.

With several European countries now cautiously lifting lockdown measures, Angela Merkel’s office announced on Tuesday that local authorities in Germany would have to close schools and all but non-essential shops once again if the number of new cases rose to more than 35 in every 100,000 in a particular area within a seven-day period.

The move came on the eve of a key meeting between the chancellor and leaders of the country’s 16 states, several of which – particularly in the less hard-hit east – want restrictions lifted faster. Germany’s largest state, Bavaria, said on Tuesday it would allow restaurants to resume outdoor service from 18 May, with indoor dining permitted a week later.

The health minister of Austria – one of the first countries to start lifting restrictions, three weeks ago – declared its outbreak was under control, with the daily increase in new infections down to 0.2%.

The situation was “very constant, very stable,” Rudolf Anschober said, adding that the first phase of exiting the country’s strict, month-long lockdown had succeeded “excellently”. People must, however, remain vigilant, he said.

Small shops reopened in Austria in mid-April, with face masks mandatory in shops and public transport. Bigger shops followed last weekend, classes in schools are gradually resuming, and restaurants are expected to reopen by mid-May.

France’s president said it was too early to say if foreign holidays would be possible this summer. As the country prepares to lift its first lockdown restrictions on 11 May, Emmanuel Macron said travel would be limited “even during the summer holidays. We will remain among Europeans, and maybe we will have to limit that even more.”

Spanish schools, meanwhile, may need to operate at half-capacity when classes resume in September, the country’s education minister said. “Until we have a remedy or a vaccine, the only tool we have to fight the virus is confinement,” Isabel Celaá told the Spanish newspaper 20 Minutos.

“We can’t jeopardise all the gains we’ve made. If we’ve got 3 million primary school children, each accompanied by an adult, turning up at school, you can imagine the huge movement that involves. If they all turn up at once, we won’t be able to maintain the required distance.”

Separate studies in Israel and the Netherlands, meanwhile, claimed to have created antibodies that could eventually help treat or prevent the development of Covid-19, a potentially significant development until a vaccine becomes available.

The Israeli defence minister announced a state-run research centre had developed an antibody that “can neutralise [the coronavirus] inside carriers’ bodies”, while a Dutch-led team of scientists said they had managed to halt infection in a lab setting.

The Guardian understands the antibody has not yet been trialled on humans, however.

['Kate Connolly'],2020-05-05,"Germany reopens museums, galleries and gardens with social distancing rules","Berlin’s botanical gardens, one of the city’s most loved green spaces, reopened its gates to the public on Tuesday with May flowers in bloom as Germans began to get used to leisure activities under a strict regime of face coverings, physical distancing and online booking.

As the gardens welcomed their first visitors since mid March, visitors were promised “the fragrance of nectar in your nostrils, the sound of birdsong in your ear” in a welcome posted on the gardens’ online ticket shop.

Germany’s six-week lockdown had confined many of the city’s residents to their flats or to struggling to keep physical distance rules in overcrowded green spaces.

No more than 1,000 visitors will be allowed in the botanical grounds at one time, and the glasshouses will be closed because physical distancing rules would be difficult to keep.

Petra Scharf, a regular visitor before the shutdown, said she had counted the days for it to reopen. “I have a balcony, I’m lucky, but I have missed the expanse of colour and and the smell of the blossom,” the 57-year-old said by phone after her morning visit, during which she said she had kept a safe distance from the friend who accompanied her, pretending to prod him with an umbrella if he got too close.

Elsewhere across Germany cultural attractions were slowly beginning to reopen.

In Potsdam, south-west of Berlin, the Museum Barberini art gallery was preparing to open its doors on Wednesday, after the lockdown interrupted an exhibition of Monet landscapes only three weeks after it opened.

The museum said it had developed a “comprehensive catalogue of protective and hygiene measures”, which include limiting the number of visitors; and visitors having to book online and be guided in a strict circular path around the exhibition for a maximum stay of two hours. Audio guides will no longer be for hire while security guards will warn visitors not to get too close to the paintings and each other.

“We are very happy to be able to finally make the museum accessible again,” said Ortrud Westheider, the Barberini’s director. “We are also very aware of the responsibility we have towards our guests and employees.”

In Dresden the Sempergalerie, one of the country’s biggest tourist attractions, holding a collection of old-master paintings, also reopened on Tuesday. It had reopened at the end of February following a seven-year renovation, only to be closed because of the coronavirus lockdown two weeks later.

A lengthy queue had built up in front of the Sempergalerie’s entrance before it opened at 11am. A museum employee explained the hygiene regulations to the visitors, including the obligatory wearing of masks, or nose and mouth coverings, before entry.

Commercial galleries across Germany have also started opening their doors. State museums, including tourist magnets such as the Pergamon, the Alte Nationagalerie, and Gemälde Galerie, as well as a range of research institutes and libraries, are due to reopen on 12 May. Visitors are asked, in almost all cases, to book a time slot online. Digital guided tours during the lockdown will remain available for those whose health will not permit them to visit the museums.

Elsewhere zoos, several of which suggested that a lack of income meant they might have to kill their animals, have been allowed to reopen for the past week but with considerable restrictions.

In Berlin, panda cubs born in September are not on public display, and all feeding times in front of visitors have been cancelled.

Nightclubs, concert halls and other cultural institutes where physical distancing is virtually impossible, have so far had no indication from the government as to when and under what conditions they could reopen.

A meeting between the government and the country’s 16 state leaders on Wednesday is expected to make decisions on schools and nurseries as well as sporting activities, and to indicate when and under what conditions restaurants and tourist attractions might be allowed to reopen across the country.

On Tuesday Bavaria announced a phased reopening of its outdoor restaurants. Several states announced that rambling and hiking was allowed once again, as were other outdoor physical activities not requiring physical contact, such as golf.

All large events, such as football matches and other sports contests, music festivals, circuses and fairs, remain banned until further notice.

['Ap In Moscow'],2020-05-05,Russia domestic violence cases more than double under lockdown,"Figures from human rights commissioner paint different picture to that provided by police

Reported cases of domestic violence in Russia have more than doubled during the country’s coronavirus lockdown, according to the Russian human rights commissioner, who painted a different picture to that provided by police data.

Complaints and reports made to Russian non-governmental organisations spiked from roughly 6,000 in March to more than 13,000 in April, Tatyana Moskalkova said on Tuesday. “The picture is rather non-optimistic,” the RIA Novosti news agency quoted her as saying.

'Calamitous': domestic violence set to soar by 20% during global lockdown Read more

Her statement came a week after Russian police said the number of domestic crimes fell by 13% during the lockdown, compared to the same month last year – a report dismissed by some women’s rights campaigners as inaccurate as many victims do not report domestic abuse to the police.

Growing numbers of domestic abuse complaints have been reported all across Europe after governments instituted lockdowns and ordered residents to stay at home, as the frustrations of enforced isolation, often fuelled by increased use of alcohol and dire economic constraints, aggravated existing tensions or triggered new ones. Women and children are usually the victims.

In Spain, calls to the helpline for domestic violence victims were up 30.7% between 14 March, when the lockdown was announced, and 15 April in year-on-year terms.

In the UK it was found that calls to a national domestic abuse helpline jumped by 49% in early April compared with the average in the same period in previous years. France’s National Federation of Women Solidarity said the hotline they ran had received double to triple the usual daily number of calls since France imposed a lockdown on 17 March. In Greece, where the lockdown started on 23 March, a government helpline received nearly four times as many complaints in April as in March.

In many countries government officials are taking steps to address the problem.

The French government introduced a text messaging number and a Twitter account victims can reach out to in addition to the usual police number. Moreover, authorities tasked pharmacies and a number of chain supermarkets to arrange points of contact for domestic abuse victims. Britain pledged £76m to help vulnerable children and victims of domestic violence.

But rights groups argue that Russia has failed to take any steps to stop domestic violence. The Kremlin imposed a nationwide lockdown in late March. Almost immediately, women’s rights advocates sounded the alarm about a surge of domestic violence cases.

In a letter to the government, nine non-governmental organisations asked officials to set up more shelters, instruct police officers about the importance of responding to domestic violence calls and help victims get medical, legal and psychological help.

Nothing has been done so far, said Olga Gnezdilova, a lawyer with the Russian Justice Initiative, one of the groups that signed the letter.

Domestic violence has been rampant in Russia for years, and so far little political will has been shown to tackle the issue. Despite the fact that, according to police data, up to 40% of all violent crimes are committed within families, in 2017 Vladimir Putin downgraded simple assault against a family member from a criminal offence to a misdemeanour, punishable by a $76 fine.

['Chris Humphrey In Hanoi'],2020-05-06,"Vietnam crushed the coronavirus outbreak, but now faces severe economic test","Strict quarantining and widespread testing have helped the country avoid disaster, but with tourism on hold the nation’s future is uncertain

Vietnam didn’t just flatten its coronavirus curve, it crushed it. No deaths have been reported, official case numbers have plateaued at just 271, and no community transmissions of the virus have been reported in the last two weeks. On 23 April, the nation eased lockdowns in its major cities and life is gradually returning to normal. It is a stark contrast to many other nations including the US, where more Americans have died from Covid-19 than during the entire Vietnam war.

Kidong Park, the World Health Organisation’s representative to Vietnam, has praised the country’s response to the crisis.

Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000 Read more

Quarantining tens of thousands in military-style camps and vigorous contact tracing procedures have helped Vietnam to avoid the disasters unfolding in Europe and the US. After testing over 213,000 people, the nation has the highest test-per-confirmed-case ratio of any country in the world. A creative public information campaign featuring viral handwashing songs and propaganda-style art helped, but it was decisive early action – hastened by a government praised for its response to Sars in 2003 – that proved most effective.

Vietnam’s first two confirmed cases of Covid-19 appeared in late January. On 1 February, Vietnam Airlines ceased all flights to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong and the border with China was shut days later. After a fresh wave of new infections in March, all international flights were grounded and a nationwide lockdown commenced on 1 April. While other nations announced lockdowns to deal with existing crises, Vietnam enacted one to prevent one.

Second waves of the virus have, however, already hit Japan and Hong Kong. To mitigate the risk of a fresh outbreak occurring in Vietnam, wearing face masks in public remains mandatory and gatherings of more than 30 individuals are banned, as are festivals, religious ceremonies and sporting events.

Park stresses the importance of education about the virus at community level, along with strengthening preventative measures in health facilities, offices, schools and other places where it is essential for people to go regularly.

But he warned of the economic consequences and this likely influenced the government’s decision to end the lockdown on 23 April.

Many non-essential services, such as bars and karaoke parlours, are still closed. Some will never recover. Constraints have been lifted for shops, hotels and restaurants, yet in a nation where tourism accounts for 6% of GDP, the future looks increasingly uncertain – especially when nobody has a clear idea of when borders will reopen.

A report released by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) last month said at least 10 million Vietnamese could lose their jobs or face reduced income in the second quarter of 2020. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a growth rate of 2.7% for Vietnam in 2020, a drop from around 7% last year.

In early April, the government announced a $2.5bn support package for Vietnam’s poor, with the most vulnerable receiving $76 per week. “Rice ATMs” and “zero dong stores” have been set up in major cities to assist those hardest hit, yet even when combined with additional government funding, such support only goes so far.

A Hanoi-based economist, Nguyen Van Trang, says the path ahead looks ominous. “Incredibly difficult decisions lie ahead on how and when to reopen the country…,” she says, but adds that despite external risks Vietnam has begun to restore manufacturing, services and retail sectors. “The internal resilience is huge. A large part of the population survived through hardships during the war, so they will be able to bounce back very quickly.”

For some of Vietnam’s most vulnerable, the situation looks bleak. With attention diverted towards the pandemic, NGOs have been hit hard. Blue Dragon Children’s Foundation, an organisation that works with street children in Hanoi and rescues victims of human trafficking from China, has seen donations plummet. Skye Maconachie, the organization’s joint chief executive, says the crisis has already led to an increase in homelessness and hunger.

“Many of the children and families we work with were already in poverty or in crisis, so now they are reaching a breaking point,” Maconachie says. “Traffickers prey on vulnerable people, so we expect to see an increase in human trafficking and labour exploitation over the coming months.”

Whatever the future holds, Vietnam, a nation of 96 million, appears to have contained the virus. As of Wednesday, Singapore had 19,410 confirmed cases of Covid-19 – the highest in south-east Asia – and 18 deaths, while Indonesia has more than 12,000 cases and 872 deaths. As Vietnam emerges from lockdown, the eyes of the world will be watching.

“The fight against Covid-19 is ongoing and the next wave is always possible as outbreaks are still reported globally.” Vietnam, Park says, “should not lose its grip.”

"['Alastair Gee', 'Dani Anguiano']",2020-05-05,'It sounded evil': inside the eerie moment California’s deadliest wildfire began,"Four miles east of Paradise, California as the crow flies, fire chief Matt McKenzie awoke in confusion at 5am on Thursday, 8 November 2018. It sounded like rain hitting the metal roof of the fire station, but there was none in the forecast.

It took him a moment to realize that it was pine needles being flung by a strange wind – not the usual intermittent gusts he was accustomed to hearing swoosh down the canyon, but a sustained, jet-engine roar. He got up and went to the station’s small kitchen, where he put the coffee on and started dicing potatoes and onions for his crew’s breakfast.

A 20-year veteran of Cal Fire, California’s state firefighting force, McKenzie had never rested easy at Jarbo Gap. Its location alone was enough to quicken the heart. The station was atop a high ridge overlooking the canyon in which a branch of the Feather River flowed southward, at about the point the canyon and the river make an abrupt, 90-degree turn to the east. Winds streaming down the canyon would run straight into this turn and spill out, moaning over the top of the station, especially at night, when canyon winds commonly pick up. Fires in the region often start in this steep and inaccessible declivity, served by a single main road that meanders alongside the water.

At 6.15am, the electric company PG&E experienced a power outage on a high-voltage line that traversed the canyon. Only one customer was affected – a hydroelectric station located in the canyon that was operated by a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area. At about 6.28am, a PG&E supervisor driving through the canyon six miles north of Jarbo Gap saw a fire that he estimated to measure 100 sq ft in a clearing below the transmission line, and radioed a nearby company facility, which conveyed the alert to emergency services.

This was the first warning of what would become the deadliest US wildfire in a century, claiming 85 lives and ravaging an entire town. Sparked in a region desiccated by drought, a few hours north of San Francisco, it would also be a harbinger of how the climate crisis is transforming the natural world.

Before long, McKenzie’s phone lit up with a text informing him of an ignition. He opened the back door to the kitchen and the wind ripped it right out of his hands. Although he expected to catch the smell of the fire, all he got was the dry pines. He and five other firefighters headed into the canyon in the dark in two trucks. It was a place McKenzie had known his entire life – as a kid growing up in the nearby town of Oroville, he would come up here with his dad to hunt, fish, or log a Christmas tree in the high, green solitude. It took them about fifteen minutes to reach the fire, going as fast as they could while keeping the engines on the road and avoiding nosediving into the canyon. As soon as they got there, McKenzie was dismayed.

We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back Read more

The flames – sheltered and low to the ground, a dusky orange – were on the wrong side of the river. McKenzie had been hoping that they would be on the canyon’s east side, where they would be accessible from the two-lane highway he was on. Instead they were west of the river, off a dirt track called Camp Creek Road. It was an impossible location. Camp Creek Road was hewn roughly into the side of the valley and in some places had been washed out by floods. It was so narrow that a fire truck could pull in its wing mirrors and still probably scrape the rock outcroppings. It could take another forty minutes just to carefully creep down to the blaze, and once they reached it there would be nowhere to turn around, meaning the truck would have to reverse out. That would be agonizingly difficult under any circumstances, but especially in the face of flames being wind-whipped toward them.

It was a situation in which McKenzie would want to call in aircraft to drop water or retardant, but he knew that wasn’t an option: it was too dark and the wind too savage. “It was so close to a highway yet so far away,” he said. “It was taunting – you see it, look at it, and it’s right there, and you can’t do a frigging thing about it.”

It looked to Matt McKenzie like a fire with enormous potential, the kind of fire he might want to throw hundreds of fire engines at

Camp Creek Road may have defied fire crews, but it did lend the blaze its incongruously playful name: the Camp fire. Analyzing from the highway, McKenzie thought the wind was behaving unusually. Typically it blows south, toward his station. This time it was blowing west, as if trying to push the fire up the wall of the river valley, in the direction of the small community of Concow and, beyond it, Paradise. This was why he had been unable to catch its smell earlier.

It looked to him like a fire with enormous potential, the kind of fire he might want to throw hundreds of fire engines at. But there were only a fraction of that number in the county. He radioed the incident command team in Oroville, the county seat, and requested fifteen additional engines and four bulldozers. His hope was that they would catch the fire once it topped the slope it seemed to want to crest.

Escaping with dogs and a cat

The community of Concow centers on Concow Reservoir, which presents as an alpine lagoon fringed with tule reeds and piney mountains. The valley is a dimple in the gnarly uplands that separate Paradise and Jarbo Gap, and despite its relative proximity of only a couple miles to both, the circuitous roads mean that it takes 45 minutes to drive to the former and 25 minutes to the latter. People moved here to work the land and for the sun-speckled, dirt-road lifestyle. In the early 1970s, Concow’s population of loggers, homesteaders, and retirees was supplemented by hippie types looking for a more sustainable kind of existence, inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog, Wendell Berry, and the back to the land movement.

A former firefighter who lived in Concow named Scott Carlin had been doing his best to shut his mind off when he overheard a transmission from Jarbo Gap firefighters at the scene of the fire. Severe insomnia meant Carlin could go three or four days without sleeping, and that night, for the first time in years, he was forced to forgo his usual Ambien pill because he had been unable to fill his prescription. He lay oppressively awake on the living-room couch in a house west of the lake as his wife, Renee Carlin, a nurse at both an ER and a jail, and their two sons, Michael and Cody, dozed peacefully.

Carlin kept several of his old helmets on the wall, including the one he’d worn on a callout 20 years before, which almost became his last. He had been searching a burning mobile home for its occupant when a fireball exploded through it; he hit the floor, inches below the boiling maelstrom, and only got out because a colleague was groping for him through the doorway. Now he was a stay-at-home dad taking care of the property and of Cody, a sweet boy who had autism and needed ferrying to special classes and therapists. But it was hard for Carlin to shake the fire bug, which explained the radio scanners tuned to emergency frequencies on a desk just over his shoulder.

The message said the fire in Concow could be dangerous, but Carlin was cautious: was it really the case, or was the firefighter just green? When a second transmission confirmed the risk, Carlin roused his wife and sons, and they started throwing belongings in suitcases. Outside he tried to clear flammable brush away from the house with his little tractor, but it didn’t have much effect. Another radio message said that a home nearby had caught fire, and Carlin ran five minutes down a dirt footpath through the ponderosas, to the lakeside home of his wife’s parents, to tell them to get out. He jogged back to his own house, and then, for good measure, went back to his in-laws one more time to make sure they had left. Carlin joked that his mother-in-law, a retired teacher, did not operate on any schedule but her own. To his relief, they had gone.

On the radio, Carlin heard that the main road out of the valley was blocked. Having planned to escape this way, he was forced to change his course. Immediately he thought of the one place he knew would be free of fire. Carrying their cases – with their cat in a cage and their two dogs on leashes – Renee and the kids hurried through the smoky woods, past her parents’ house and toward the lakeshore. Cody had been afraid of dogs since a family pet had jumped on him and knocked him over when he was little. Renee told him he would just have to take one. Michael dashed to see if their aged neighbor, whom they only knew as Bruno, had left, and returned with Bruno’s arm around his shoulder, half carrying, half dragging him down the hill.

In no time at all they were engulfed. Flames were licking the edge of the lake, and the family edged out up to their knees in the muddy tule reeds. Bruno’s foot got stuck and he fell on his back. Fragile at the best of times, he seemed to give up. Just go, he told Carlin. Leave me alone. When Carlin went to pull him up, Bruno refused to give him his arm. “I’m not doing that,” Carlin said. “I’m not leaving you, I’m not gonna burn, so you’d better get your butt up.”

Unexpectedly, the reeds began to catch fire, and they had to edge deeper into the lake. Renee and her sons were quickly up to their necks or treading water. Cody had the cat in a cage on his shoulder, and the mewling animal was half-submerged. It was early November in the mountains, and the water was so painfully cold it took Renee’s breath away. She thought her heart might stop. Carlin, still in the reeds with Bruno, couldn’t see her in the smoke.

I’m not leaving you, I’m not gonna burn, so you’d better get your butt up Scott Carlin

Swim to the island, he shouted to them. By island he meant a peninsula sticking out from the opposite side, about 350ft away. Cody stayed behind, but she and Michael kicked out in the frigid water, and in the half-light, Renee could see the shore around her wreathed in smoke, and orange flashes of flame. The husky she was holding got loose and swam back to Scott. The border collie, panicking, tried to climb on top of her and threatened to push her under, and she screamed.

Yet the wind was so strong that despite propelling themselves in one direction they were pushed in another, down-shore of where they had launched out. It was a lucky mishap – Michael found two rowboats, each with a paddle inside, tied with a cable to a stump. He tried to wrench the cable apart, but it wouldn’t give, so he smashed the wooden post. Waterlogged and rotten, it splintered. Paddling themselves back to Carlin, they tried to coax Bruno aboard, but he flatly refused to get in. He simply couldn’t do it, he said. So with one hand Michael steadied a boat, and with the other he lifted Bruno onto the craft. Under the weight of four people and the dogs the boats were only two or three inches above the water, and Carlin told them to go without him. He would find them later.

They struck out, and this time they did end up on the peninsula. Soaking wet, they were freezing despite the occasional hot gust from across the lake, and they hid behind a rocky outcropping to try to keep out of the wind. Bruno’s ability to make sense of the situation was going, and he seemed not to remember what was happening. Renee’s legs were so cold that she couldn’t walk. Michael went to find help, hollering in case someone could hear him. In the distance there was a response to his cry.

‘The fire is now in Paradise’

On lots hidden by screens of trees across the valley, long-timers fired up their tractors or chainsaws and began clearing flammable brush from around their properties, to create a swathe of defensible space. Others jumped into their cars and poured out onto bad roads on which visibility was rapidly diminishing. They witnessed things that defied all logic and experience.

Looking across the road to her neighbor’s property, just a few hundred feet away, one woman, a British transplant named Joanna Curtin, saw a bulging whirlwind of flame and smoke that was sucking debris from the ground, setting it alight, and rocketing it into the sky. It was a fire tornado as wide as a pickup truck, and it was moving slowly but inexorably toward her.

“It sounded like a freight train going around. It sounded … it had this other sound too, more evil,” she said. “Oh God, I can’t even imagine what I could describe it as close to,” she added. “There was nothing earthly about it.” It was spinning and “throwing big pieces of wood on fire,” three to four feet in length. This meant one thing to Curtin: it’s time to go, doesn’t matter, leave everything and just go.

Firefighter Matt McKenzie was still in the Feather River canyon, patrolling the highway and trying to save what structures he could. And he’d been hearing radio traffic he couldn’t quite make sense of. There was trouble in Concow, that he knew, but it seemed, incomprehensibly, as though the fire had jumped even farther, at speeds he thought almost impossible.

At 7.42am, firefighters reported four small fires across the lake. Within two minutes a caller at Drayer Drive, on the eastern edge of Paradise, reported fire in the canyon his home overlooked.

Officials requested six tankers, a lead plane, and six helicopters. At 7.56am, dispatchers fielded a call about someone possibly trapped by the fire.

Two minutes later, Engine 81 in Paradise reported a spot fire at 1831 Apple View Way, a four-bedroom home near Paradise’s 97-old Noble Orchards.

Otters juggle pebbles when hungry, study finds","Whether tossing pebbles between their paws or rolling stones on their chest and even into their mouth, otters are experts at rock juggling. Now researchers say the behaviour largely appears to be linked to a rumbling tummy.

Many species of otters are known to toss pebbles around, often while lying on their backs, in what appears to be an example of animals playing with inanimate objects. Mari-Lisa Allison, of the University of Exeter, said: “[I have seen] an otter at the fence putting a pebble through the mesh and then catching it underneath and rolling it round, round the fence”.

But quite why otters rock-juggle has been something of a conundrum. Now Allison and colleagues say their experiments back up the view that otters rock-juggle more when they are hungry.



“This seems to be the immediate driver of the behaviour. There, in that moment, they are rock juggling because they are hungry, they are anticipating food and they are getting excited,” said Allison. But, she noted, further research is needed. “The ultimate function is still quite a mystery,” she said.

Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Allison and colleagues told of examining the behaviour of otters at three wildlife parks and zoos in the UK. The team recorded about 12 hours of observations for each of 48 otters, six of which were smooth-coated otters and 42 of which were Asian small-clawed otters.

The team note the small-clawed otters forage for shellfish and crabs, while the smooth-coated feeds on fish. This difference suggested the latter might juggle rocks more frequently as they relied on dexterous movements to a greater degree. However the team found no such difference, although they said that could be due to the small number of smooth-coated otters observed, adding that the two species did show different juggling actions.

Further analysis revealed that among otters aged 11 years or below, juggling was more frequent the younger the animal, suggesting, the team said, that the movements could help with the development of motor skills.

However, the behaviour was also common among senior otters. Perhaps, the team said, the juggling had a role in preventing cognitive decline, although more work is needed to explore the idea.

The researchers also found otters juggled more frequently if they had not been fed for two or more hours. The team said that that could support previous suggestions that rock juggling was a type of “misdirected foraging” – in other words the hungry otters could be performing the type of dexterous movements they would use when extracting meat from shellfish but on rocks or pebbles instead.

Yet rock juggling does not seem to be a way by which the otters practise or improve their skills. The team presented the otters with minced meat inside medicine bottles, tennis balls and between two plastic bricks, but those experiments gave no sign that otters who juggled more frequently had greater success with solving puzzles.

But the team say the experiment had limitations; many of the older otters were arthritic, and the animals could have been put off by the unfamiliar nature of the task or might not have understood the puzzle.

Prof Hannah Dugdale, of the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the work, welcomed the study. “The reason why otters juggle rocks has been difficult to study as there are many different variables that need to be considered at the same time, such as the age of individuals and how hungry they are,” she said, adding that the new study helped tease apart such factors.

But, she added, more work is needed to explore factors involved in rock juggling in wild otters, and its frequency, to fully understand the evolution of such behaviour.

Dr Elizabeth Chadwick, of Cardiff University, who is principal investigator of the Cardiff University Otter Project, also said questions remained. “Otters are absolutely captivating and rock juggling is one of their most intriguing behaviours,” she said. “The study helps explore and describe some of the differences in rock juggling between individuals, but is unable to provide the elusive answer as to why otters juggle.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/06/tummy-rumbles-otters-juggle-pebbles-probably-when-peckish
['Aniefiok Ekpoudom'],2020-05-05,Drillosophy: why UK rappers are teaching Plato in lockdown,"Before coronavirus put the UK into lockdown, writer and youth worker Ciaran Thapar and rapper turned ethnomusicologist Mehryar Golestani (stage name Reveal) had been running their “inclusive music education programme” Roadworks, using genres such as drill to engage young people in critical thinking and academic subjects. With the timeline for the country’s restart still unclear, Thapar and Reveal have now carved out an online space for their music-led youth work to continue in the video series Drillosophy.

In each of six episodes, they take a philosophical concept and break it down using metaphors thrown up in some of drill and UK rap’s most popular songs. The first episode, released last week, is titled Skengdo’s Cave, teaching the concept of Plato’s cave – a metaphor concerning mental freedom and the perception of reality – by dissecting the lyrics of south London drill duo Skengdo x AM. This is philosophy made accessible for “those not paying attention to their science teacher on Zoom”, says Thapar.

“I’d been using Plato’s cave among lots of different thought experiments in youth work for a few years,” he continues. “There’s a reason why these ideas stand the test of time; there’s something about Plato’s cave that just clicks straight away. Young people are like: I’m with you.”

Each episode will be released via Mixtape Madness, an independent music platform whose YouTube channel has become a hub for Britain’s emerging rap and drill artists. In the first episode, Thapar and Reveal, with input from Skengdo x AM, take a critical look at a genre that has been demonised and censored by authorities. They home in on a Skengdo lyric – “You don’t even know this guy / He wears a tracksuit so you think he’s trapping” – and then, via animations, compare it with the notions of distorted reality raised by Plato. “We’re not trying to speak to young people,” Reveal says. “We’re trying to empower them so they can speak for themselves.”

Drill has become the prevailing sound of UK youth culture, a fraught illustration of the lives of teenagers engulfed in violence. And while the genre has detractors who point to its sometimes violent or taunting lyrics, both Drillosophy presenters feel that to understand the experiences of young people, their modes of expression need to be embraced.

Thapar says drill is “something so all-pervading and powerful, talked about in politics and parliament and mainstream media. It travels into prisons and debating societies in university. Something about drill is connecting with a lot of people, on a human level. If you ignore that, if you don’t take that into account when talking to young people, you’re basically denying what they’re seeing around them, you’re not existing in the same world as they are.”

Other episodes in the series will intertwine Aristotle’s concept of catharsis with lyrics by Krept & Konan, Knucks, Pop Smoke and Ambush, and use English philosopher Jeremy Bentham as a roadmap for exploring why some rappers obscure their faces with balaclavas. Each episode, Reveal says, will be supported with online material to explain the concepts in detail, and for parents, carers and youth workers, provide important context on drill as a genre.

“By embracing drill,” Thapar continues, “by trying to tackle it – not singing and dancing about it like it’s got no problems – but by really trying to get to grips with it, I think engages with a certain level of the truth. As a youth worker, teacher, educator, if you’re trying to engage with them on that level it’s really powerful.”

The capacity for youth work in London has been shattered, Thapar says, by years of austerity and government cuts that have adversely affected the young and the vulnerable in the city. The situation has been further strained by the Covid-19 epidemic, with Thapar concerned for “vulnerable young people trapped in difficult circumstances for a long time”. To combat the latter, they have also been conducting mentoring sessions via Zoom (a move facilitated by Brixton-based organisation Spiral) in attempts to stay connected to the young people they work with.

The lockdown, Reveal says, has interrupted their usual setup of hosting workshops from classrooms. “But,” he adds, “one thing that never surprised me is how resilient young people are when adapting. They say when you’re young, your bones knit together quicker. So many young people are used to living with communication, and technology, that they’ve actually made that transition into this digital era that has been forced on us because of lockdown really successfully.”

Drill is a genre that has embraced the internet and technology from its inception. Its early videos leaked out of Chicago via YouTube, while in the UK, many artists have trumped a lack of traditional media support by thriving on pockets of social media, DIY YouTube channels and even Reddit forums. Beyond music, drill points to the attitudes, behaviours and platforms that steer the attention of the people youth workers are often working with, and so platforms such as Drillosophy meet them on their own turf.

“Technologically, the generational divide between teenagers and even ourselves is so huge and growing,” Thapar says, “let alone for a certain generation of decision-makers in politics and education, that I think we’ve got to use whatever we can to connect with young people. Drill, for me, represents music colliding with technological change in a way that we’ve never seen before and we’re just learning about. To ignore it, not only ignores truth but also ignores the technological world we live in.” With Roadworks and Drillosophy, he and Reveal are showing a new way out of the cave.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/05/drillosophy-why-uk-rappers-are-teaching-plato-in-lockdown
['Jessa Crispin'],2020-05-05,Normal People is little more than a gutless soap opera for millennials | Jessa Crispin,"Here we have a young woman, smart and beautiful, but emotionally distant because she is a product of the cold, aristocratic upper classes. But she’s different, you know? We know this because she does things like look out of windows, daydreaming, which regular people would never dare to do.

Then we have this young lad. He’s handsome and charming, sociable and popular. He’s from the working classes, which we know because, well, the show keeps telling us he is. And because his house is not as nice as her house.

Why are we so obsessed with young, successful people like Sally Rooney? | Ammar Kalia Read more

These two people from different worlds will come together when his mother is hired to clean her house, and this poor lad will introduce the frigid rich girl to sexual ecstasy. It could be a story from 50% of any of the romantic novels ever published (the other 50% of course being the plain woman picked by the extremely wealthy and mysterious man), but instead it’s the 12-episode (!) miniseries Normal People, adapted by Hulu and the BBC from the Sally Rooney novel of the same name. It’s a story as old as time. Which might be why it’s so deathly dull.

Normal People follows these two characters, Marianne and Connell, from high school to college, with a will-they-or-won’t-they story arc, with various forms of authorial interference to separate our lovebirds at various points in order to fill time. I thought I must be missing something. People love Sally Rooney. Her books have replaced those of figures like David Foster Wallace or Joan Didion as the books to be caught out with – “Oh, did this bestselling yet critically acclaimed novel fall out of my bag at the bar right next to the person I’m sexually attracted to? How clumsy of me!” – and adroitly signal to everyone around you your great taste and your with-it-ness in regards to cultural developments.

It’s a story as old as time. Which might be why it’s so deathly dull

But I was bored. I was bored watching actors with crows’ feet play 19-year-olds. I was bored watching these very typical representations of college students doing very normal things for freshmen, like throw tasteful dinner parties with all of the food made from scratch or dabble in S&M (represented in the show as a little bit of hair pulling, which, sure). Certain that nothing was ever going to happen, I started jotting down the action of each episode. “Glances exchanged” was the entirety of episode one. Episode two, “vaginal penetration”.

Perhaps what I was missing was the deeper meaning of the show. Maybe there was something there about Marxism. Rooney is a Marxist. Did you hear that hit Irish novelist Sally Rooney has Marxist politics? The author of Normal People and Conversations with Friends, she has Marxist leanings. I know Rooney is a Marxist because she brings it up in every single interview she has ever given.

We get it, Sally. You went to an elite university. Elite universities are where Marxist transmission happens these days, after all. Saying “I’m a Marxist” is a more understated way of saying: “I went to Trinity.”

The relationship between Marianne and Connell is explored mostly through power dynamics. She’s rich, so she wields more economic power; he’s a white male so he has more societal power. Marianne’s wealth gives her a natural introduction to the children of the elite on Trinity’s Dublin campus. “Do you see that?” I asked my cat, pointing at Marianne’s circle of friends on the screen. “That’s social capital.”

The characters say excruciating things, like “As a cis white male … ” and “It’s money, though. The substance that makes the world real.” Ah, there’s the Marxism I had been looking for. Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook, iconic tome of socialist feminism, is flashed. Someone says: “Men seem more interested in limiting women’s freedoms than exploring their own.” The TV show analyzes itself for you with these offhand comments by the characters, so you don’t have to do any of the hard work of thinking, and they don’t have to do any of the hard work of delving into the complexity of contemporary heterosexuality.

The desire to tell an old story in a new way only really works if you actually have something new to say. And bringing the power imbalances between the classes or between the genders to the surface of the story only counts as new if you assume that romance novelists throughout time, and their audiences, were completely ignorant about these dynamics. At least when these same stories appear in romance novels, chick lit, and romcoms, there are usually some good jokes, and the S&M is more stimulating than just lying there limp while your hands are bound.

For all its performed awareness about class relations, the show can’t maintain an interest in anyone who isn’t extremely attractive or extremely privileged. The only character who didn’t make the move from high school to university kills himself out of the hopelessness of it all, but of course that happens off screen and is only included as a catalyst for the reunion of our protagonists. And our hero, who struggles to make his way from vague, poorly defined hardship into the upper echelons of career-making education? He completes his hero’s journey into the creative class. He gets into that New York University MFA program.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/sally-rooney-normal-people-hulu-bbc-soap-opera
['Adrian Horton'],2020-05-05,Seth Meyers: 'This is what you get when you make a TV star president',"Seth Meyers

As several states began tentative, and risky, reopening measures, Donald Trump held a town hall at the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday night exclusively for Fox News – which “makes sense”, said Seth Meyers on Late Night, because Trump is “constantly either in a state of watching Fox or appearing on Fox or watching himself appearing on Fox. Eventually Fox is just going to turn into a 24/7 feed of Trump watching himself on Fox like an infinity mirror.”

The White House has basically become a Fox News offshoot of advisers for the president, Meyers continued, such as his new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who held her first press conference last week. The hiring of McEnany, a former Fox production assistant, epitomizes “the feedback loop of disinformation and propaganda that exists between the Trump White House and Fox News”, said Meyers. McEnany is known, for example, for defending Trump on cable news in February with “outlandish lies” such as “this president will always put America first, he will always protect American citizens, we will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here”.

Fox News also played a destructive role in what the Washington Post called Trump’s “lost month” of “desperation and dysfunction” as he ignored and then gave up on fighting coronavirus and instead focused, at the behest of aides and his favorite Fox News hosts, on prematurely opening up the economy. The Post reports that frequent Fox News guest and “Trump’s toothless vampire” Rudy Giuliani and host Laura Ingraham lobbied the president repeatedly, in White House meetings and on air, to embrace the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (“Remember when everyone cared about that for a second? The Tamagotchi of Covid cures,” said Meyers) as a coronavirus treatment (it is not proven and can have fatal side-effects). “Yeah, the TV president who played a TV businessman is listening to TV doctors,” Meyers said.

Colbert: Trump 'wants everything to go back to normal because he’s bored' Read more

Still, it’s confirmation that “a Fox host with no medical expertise [Ingraham] is directly advising the president on a deadly pandemic, while that same president hires pundits he sees on TV and fires or punishes actual experts and inspector generals who criticize him”, said Meyers. “This is what you get when you make a TV star president. Because when you’re on TV, no one ever tells you you’re wrong.”

McEnany, meanwhile, “completed the Fox News feedback loop” and transitioned seamlessly to “White House liar” on Friday by ending her briefing with a plug for Trump’s town hall on Fox, which she promised would have high TV ratings. “Oh, cool, so in the middle of a deadly pandemic, the White House press secretary is like a glorified TV Guide channel,” said Meyers, breaking out a faux-promo voice: “Looking for willful ignorance from a soulless sociopath? Check out the Fox News Town Hall at seven.”

Stephen Colbert

“No surprise, Trump is lying,” said Stephen Colbert of the president’s Fox News town hall on Sunday night. “He’s willfully endangering the lives of Americans” with his plan to reopen, as confirmed by an internal government memo, leaked to the New York Times, which revealed the Trump administration predicts a near doubling of the daily death toll by June.

“That means infection rates will skyrocket!” said Colbert. “Everybody’s going to have to go back inside and America’s going to have to find another animal exploitation true crime drama to watch.”

Trump’s town hall was billed as “America Together: Returning to Work”, “and Trump not only thought that the returning to work would happen soon, he thought this disaster might actually make things better”, said Colbert, pulling up a clip of Trump promising: “You’re going to get another job, but you’re going to get a better job. You’ll get a job where you make more money, frankly, and I think that’s going to happen.”

“Really? A better job, with more money? So it’s kinda good that you ignored the virus?” Colbert scoffed, whipping out his Trump impersonation: “I think this is gonna be even better because the pigs that just flew out of my butt told me they’re hiring, so that’s a positive.”

Trump was also asked about his combative stance with the press, which he defended as necessary because he’s “treated worse” than Lincoln was. “Really? You’re going to compare yourself to Abraham Lincoln?” said Colbert. “Well I’d like to point out that none of his supporters carried Confederate flags.”

Trevor Noah

And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed plans to reopen state economies, even as coronavirus case numbers increase across the country. “You would think an increase in cases would mean that maybe now is not the perfect time to open everything up,” said Noah, “but many states in America are saying, ‘hey man, this summer is not gonna enjoy itself.’” Florida beaches, for example, are teeming with people again.

Still, “people on the beach might be the least of America’s worries,” said Noah, “because there are other groups doing much crazier things,” such as protesting against shutdown measures by storming statehouses with weapons. “Goddamn, only in America do protests start with storming the Capitol with assault rifles. I mean, did you try calling? Writing a letter? Usually the armed rebellion is the last step.”

Noah played a video in which two white female protesters badgered police officers and white men with rifles prowled the Michigan statehouse. “Now, I’m sure a lot of these people probably saw this video and said to themselves, ‘man, if black people were holding guns and shouting at the police, that protest would end badly,’” said Noah. “But guys, please, that’s not true – the protest wouldn’t have ended badly. There wouldn’t have been a protest, because all the black people would’ve been pulled over on the way there.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/05/seth-meyers-trump-what-you-get-when-you-make-tv-star-president

"['Francine Prose', 'Robert Reich']",2020-05-05,Will Americans ever forgive Trump for his heartless lack of compassion? | Francine Prose,"To exist at this moment is to navigate (or try to fend off) the flood of grief that threatens to submerge even our rare, buoyant moments. We mourn the death of friends and relatives, the absence of human contact and the everyday pleasures we once took for granted. We can’t stop thinking about the tens of thousands of families facing hunger, bankruptcy and homelessness even as they struggle to endure the loss of someone they dearly loved.

What’s striking, if not surprising, is that this deluge of sorrow has run dry at the door to the Oval Office.

Under Trump, America has gone a bit late Weimar. We know how that ended | Lloyd Green Read more

One’s heart goes out to the reporters who have sifted through the Donald Trump’s press briefings on the current pandemic – hour after hour of bombast, self-promotion, vitriol, lies and recklessly unscientific speculation – for any evidence of sympathy for those who are in pain. It’s hardly a shock to learn that our president’s expressions of care and compassion have occupied a total of less than five minutes, out of all that time.

After all, a man who mocked a disabled journalist and boasted about grabbing women wasn’t elected for the depths of his kindness and the purity of his moral conscience. And it seems unrealistically optimistic to have hoped that the extremity of this crisis should have inspired, in our leader, a deep and essential change of heart.

Arguably, few politicians seek (and are elected to) office out of an excess of compassion. Even those who respond to catastrophe in more appropriately “human” ways – George W Bush mourning the victims of 9/11, Obama tearing up at the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting – have been parochial in their sympathies; there was little ceremonial grieving for the innocent child-casualties of our bombing and drone strikes in the Middle East.

And yet we can’t help thinking how much less worried we would be if a humane, competent, well-informed adult was making the decisions that affect us all. Though we’ve learned that Franklin Delano Roosevelt turned away refugees from Hitler’s Europe, we can still imagine how comforting it was, for those who lived through the Great Depression, hearing his radio speeches: absorbing their message of reassurance and hope, his determination to comprehend and mitigate the sufferings of our nation.

Trump’s enraged, self-infatuated maunderings are the opposite of Roosevelt’s calm resolve. Yet ultimately our president’s failure of empathy is less disturbing than the ways in which it appears to resonate with his supporters. He and his allies have framed our response to the crisis in terms of partisan politics, to imply (incorrectly, as the polls suggest) that tough conservatives are eager to get back to work sooner than scaredy-cat, stay-at-home progressives.

The flag-waving, gun-toting, defiantly unmasked protesters storming the capitol buildings in Michigan and Wisconsin would seem to support that view. This, too, is a situation that could have been defused by a president who projected sympathy, who persuaded his listeners, as Roosevelt did, that the pain of those who have lost jobs and businesses is shared by us all. Instead we see Trump’s efforts to stoke rage and bitterness because he suspects that it might help solidify his base.

It may be that the deepening polarization in our country – the suspicion, grievance and rage that the president is spouting and encouraging – is less political than spiritual. These divides go deeper than how we vote; they express our core beliefs about our responsibility to those with whom we share this brief span on this damaged planet. As Slate editor Tom Scocca posted on Twitter: “Conservatives have by now been conditioned to believe that thinking about other people ‘s needs or interests in any way is tyranny by definition,” a sentiment echoed by Emily Raboteau in the Huffington Post: “I can’t debate someone into caring about what happens to our fellow human beings.”

It’s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants

This idea that empathy and altruism are expressions of weakness and naivety is nothing new; it’s the foundation of novelist Ayn Rand’s Objectivism, and it received a major boost during the Reagan-Bush years, when “trickle-down” economics did little to stem the growing problem of homelessness. But it’s never seemed so virulent as it does today, perhaps because it has never been so openly advocated – so blatantly demonstrated – by our president. It’s hard to think of anything more corrupt or corrupting than to boast about one’s success when (as I write this) more than 60,000 Americans have died of Covid-19. It’s hard to imagine anything more grotesque than using the pandemic as an excuse to further the ongoing campaign to separate families and exclude asylum seekers and other immigrants.

What’s most frightening to me is that the lack of empathy – the selfishness, the resentment, the hope that others will suffer even more than we are suffering – is itself a kind of virus: contagious, dangerous, possibly even lethal. I’ve heard people say that the Wisconsin and Michigan protesters – shouting shoulder to shoulder, refusing to observe the simple rules of social distancing – won’t learn how profoundly Trump has betrayed them until they themselves contract the virus that they have been encouraged to downplay. I’ve even heard it said how unfair it is that our overweight, out-of-shape politicians – too vain to wear a mask, flouting scientific advice and the dictates of common sense – have proved immune to the disease that has felled so many decent, generous people.

But such statements echo the absence of compassion that Trump, by tweet and by example, is encouraging us to feel. It’s become another thing to resist. I don’t want to wish that anyone will learn that particular hard lesson, in that particularly hard way: not the governors opening their states for business before it’s safe, not the demonstrators on the state capitol steps, not our president. Despite my own anger, frustration and fear, I still can’t bring myself to claim suffering as a success.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/will-americans-forgive-trump

Faces and fists pounded the windows of Ohio’s capitol like a zombie apocalypse. In Michigan, an armed crowd stormed the state house. Then, history repeated itself.

The president tweeted that Whitmer should “give a little, and put out the fire”. In other words, negotiate over the barrel of a gun. After all, his base was “angry”.

One state over, in Illinois, an anti-shutdown protester waived a poster aimed at the state’s Jewish governor, JB Pritzker: “Arbeit macht frei, JB.” The words that hung over the gates of Auschwitz.

A Trump administration insider conveyed that it was all a “bit” reminiscent of the “late” Weimar Republic. We know how that ended.

Society’s guardrails crashed, the volk demanded its pound of flesh and democracy made the frighteningly unimaginable possible. Hell became part of the here and now.

Election day is six months away. The US may experience 25% unemployment and economic collapse. We stand to witness “between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost”, according to Dr Deborah Birx. As for the protesters, Birx labelled their conduct “devastatingly worrisome”.

“Collective rage” looms large.

Life and death are on the line and the president and his minions appear reluctant to grasp the reality. Echoing his boss, Larry Kudlow ties himself into knots over earlier pronouncements that the scourge would be quickly gone. Marc Short, Mike Pence’s chief of staff, prematurely rejects projections of a death toll above 60,000. By Tuesday, the total will probably exceed 70,000.

How this plays out at the ballot box remains to be seen. But the early numbers should give Trump serious pause. It is unlikely that racial minorities, suburban mothers and college degree holders will take kindly to bully boys playing Trump surrogates.

A poll taken last month showed most Americans wary of returning to normal, with those living in cities and suburbs signaling particular reluctance. Indeed, Republicans disfavored such a move by nearly a two-to-one margin.

As for the presidential horserace, Trump is lagging Joe Biden in most national polls and in the swing states. Among college graduates, the former vice-president holds a near 20-point lead. Biden is ahead by double digits among women. Cultural resentments are two-way streets.

All this is a continuation of trends that appeared in the 2018 midterms. Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House and Democrats captured the female vote by nearly three-to-two, suburban women by more than 20 points, and a majority of white college graduates. Peloton moms made a difference.

More ominously for the president, swing states are drifting away: Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are lining up for Biden. In a break from four years ago, seniors are growing tired of Trump. Were the trend to hold, the ballgame would be over.

Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio also appear shaky. Biden could be sitting atop an electoral college landslide.

Excluding New York state, the number of coronavirus cases has moved upward and the average number of fatalities appears stuck in neutral. This is not the re-election campaign Trump envisioned in January. Not surprisingly, some of his most ardent supporters in the Senate are engaging in political social distancing.

"['Sean Monahan', 'Francine Prose', 'Robert Reich']",2020-05-04,What gay men can teach us about surviving the coronavirus | Sean Monahan,"To be gay is to get used to blood tests. If you are positive, you do them to monitor your HIV status. If you are negative and on PrEP, a daily medication that helps prevent HIV, you do them to ensure it’s working. If you are negative and not on PrEP, you do them to maintain your sanity. Every gay person has their own rhythm to testing, defined by their relationship to HIV, their sexual practices and their neuroses. No matter your status, waiting for test results is never easy. You count the minutes until you hear via text, in person, over the phone, in an app: your body is OK for now.

It won’t end until there is a cure. What we have right now is management. In the US, since around 1980 when the country’s first cases were identified, 700,000 people have died of Aids. In my lifetime, it went from an epidemic with no cure to one for which we have the tools to at least approximate herd immunity. People still die. There are no certainties. And the blood sacrifice we give at the clinic every few months reminds us of this.

We also remember not to blindly trust experts. Before writing this, I rewatched the Aids activism documentary How to Survive a Plague by David France, Woody Richman and Tyler Walk (full disclosure: Jordan Richman, my collaborator, is Woody Richman’s cousin). It’s inspiring because a group of activists rejected the incompetence and ignorance of politicians and played a decisive role in forcing them to find treatment. Act Up, the HIV/Aids activist group, was not always right, but neither were the experts. There was no time to wait for gay representation in the CDC, the FDA, Congress or White House. They used the tools of self-education and critical engagement to ensure they understood the issues and were able to call bullshit on their credentialed betters when necessary.

I spent those years in brutal terror, flat-out convinced I would be one of the dead. I have always thought that it was fear that saved my life. But 15 years after that, when I returned to the troves of archival videotape to make How to Survive a Plague, I was surprised to see how much joy there was among us. Some of the humor was dark, naturally, but all of it was affirming and forward-focused. Someone once said to me, ‘We had so much fun when everybody was dying,’ which sounds awful, but what she meant was not that we didn’t grieve or weep; she meant that we didn’t give up on the vision of a life we so fiercely defended. I think now that the power to imagine, put to the test by a plague, is the strongest tool we can deploy.”

The movie was released in 2012, and I went to see it at the IFC Center in New York. What struck me then was that this was still necessary. I remember returning home after college, and feeling like I had gone too long without STD testing. I made an appointment with my GP but got bumped to a physician’s assistant in his office. When I asked for screening, she replied incredulously: “Why do you want these tests? You think you have all the STDs?!” I remember my monotone and annoyed response: “I’m a gay man. I have multiple sexual partners. Men are oftentimes asymptomatic. I’m just here to get my periodic screening.” Sometimes you have to be the waiting room pamphlet you want to see in the world.

The only way out of our houses will be for everyone to get out of their comfort zones

Just because someone is a doctor doesn’t mean they’re not an idiot. I don’t mean that to demean healthcare workers, only to point out they are humans, too. So let’s keep our wits about us. Let’s evaluate people based on actions, not positions. Let’s not forget that sometimes we do know more than experts. If we don’t, they will never be able to refine and update their opinions. They will not see what they don’t see.

Seeing a newsflash that passengers from a quarantined cruise ship were refusing to be tested for the coronavirus, I reflexively cringed. It was so clear to me, someone who has nervously fidgeted in waiting rooms more times that I can count, that they were making a stupid choice. In gay parlance, to not “know your status” is to transform uncertainty into risk. Early detection and treatment is what would keep you healthy in the event you are seroconverted, and it is what keeps you secure in the knowledge you will not endanger the people you love. When I pointed that out to a straight friend, they were confused. “I dunno. I get it. Maybe better not to know.” They were dead-ass fucking wrong.

Similarly, when talk of immunity passports popped up in Germany, the UK, Brazil, I noticed a sharp division between the analogies straight and gay friends used. Straight friends saw segregating people based on immunity as something with dark potential. Was it fascist? Nazi even? Gay friends had a different response: this was Truvada. This was the thing that could make the invisible visible.

Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria Read more

With a critical mass of people positive and negative on Truvada, we can relax. Positive people more easily achieve undetectability – tests cannot find the HIV virus in their blood – and thus can’t pass the disease, while negative people essentially cannot contract it, even if a partner has not achieved undetectability. Immunity passports with a rapid testing regime might provide the possibility that we can organize our societies as if we had achieved herd immunity, allowing those who are unable to contract the coronavirus the possibility of relaxing and those who have not yet contracted it to take proactive measures to avoid the virus.

The politics of disclosure are important to this. Straight people simply aren’t used to constantly disclosing very private health information to new friends, and sometimes strangers. Of course, this can be avoided if you are celibate or in a long-term monogamous relationship, but honestly, who wants that? It’s not especially pleasant.

To be honest, though I’m negative, even I find it a bit awkward. Cum is a disease vector. Your responsibility to your community is to put ‘what’s your status’ into your saved phrases on Grindr.

As we exit this crisis, these are the lessons everyone will have to learn. It will be important, for those schooled in the days when a new acquaintance asking about your medical health would be unthinkable, not to take offense. The question comes from care. In all likelihood, since treatment is far away and vaccines possibly further, a testing plus passport regimen will allow us to slowly escape lockdown. The only way out of our houses will be for everyone to get out of their comfort zones.

['Paul Macinnes'],2020-05-05,Premier League club doctors express serious concern over football restart,"A group of club doctors has written to the Premier League expressing concern over potential risks to restarting the competition during the Covid-19 pandemic.



Before a crucial period for Project Restart, doctors have raised questions with the league over a number of issues to do with protocols designed to guarantee a safe return to training and, should government advice allow, full competition.

Football's future: 'Pubs and clubs won't bounce back for many months' Read more

At least one club doctor is known by the Guardian to have serious concerns about the protocols and whether football can be made safe in the near future. The questions were raised by at least four doctors and were sent via the Premier League doctors group to the league’s chief medical adviser, Mark Gillett. The league says the questions were requested as part of a continuing process of refining the protocols.



The measures were first discussed with the 20 top-flight clubs at an extraordinary meeting last Friday. They have not been approved by the clubs, however, and any final drafting is not expected to be complete until after the government makes recommendations on the possible easing of lockdown measures on Sunday.



Some of the doctors’ concerns are expected to be directly addressed in these recommendations, and a vote on the protocols is expected to be taken at a Premier League meeting on Monday.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/premier-league-club-doctors-express-serious-concern-over-football-restart
['Giles Richards'],2020-05-05,F1 risks angering Ferrari and Red Bull as it reveals long-term budget cap plans,"Formula One has presented its long-term roadmap for reducing the teams’ budget reduction, with a decision expected next week. It is understood that figures include a cap set for $145m in 2021, coming down to $140m in 2022 and then to $135m for 2023-25.

The targeted numbers are seen as acceptable to midfield teams such as McLaren but agreement is far from a given, with potential pushback at the scale of the proposed cuts possible from Ferrari and Red Bull.

F1 teams close to agreeing $145m budget cap for 2021 season Read more

On Monday F1’s sporting director Ross Brawn announced that new proposals had been sent to the teams. Last year a cap of $175m (£142m) was agreed for 2021. The financial impact of races being called off because of coronavirus has forced the sport to readdress the issue.

Brawn believes F1, the FIA and the teams were close to coming to an agreement for 2021 but noted the intent was for greater cuts without publicly offering any details. “The discussion really is how much further down we can drive it in the next few years,” he said. It is believed the $145m ceiling has broad support but the other figures under discussion are likely to prove more contentious.

McLaren’s chief executive Zak Brown has warned F1 could lose up to four of its 10 teams if the impact of coronavirus is not handled correctly and that F1 should use this as a chance to ensure the sport remains sustainable in future.

Ferrari, however, have opposed a drop below $145m, warning it was already a demanding request below which the team would be forced to consider how it employs its racing resources. Ferrari’s team principal Mattia Binotto also fears that too great a cap would risk devaluing the sport’s reputation for technical excellence as the pinnacle of motorsport. He is in favour of a two-tier cap to reflect the higher spending of the bigger teams on manufacturing parts, however this two-tier approach is not in the proposal, which may also prove a stumbling block.

Similarly Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner has also opposed any imminent cap below $145m. Earlier in April a meeting with the teams to discuss a proposed drop to $130m in 2022 failed to reach any agreement. However, recent regulation changes by the FIA mean that unanimity of agreement across the teams is no longer required and the proposals can be adopted with a majority in the face of opposition.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/f1-risks-angering-ferrari-and-red-bull-as-it-reveals-long-term-budget-cap-plans
[],2020-05-05,"No guarantee Tour de France will go ahead, says French sports minister","The French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu has delivered a stark warning to cycling, declaring that there is “no guarantee” that the Tour de France will go ahead this year.

The Tour has already been rescheduled from June to a 29 August start because of the Covid-19 crisis, but the minister could offer little assurance that the race would be given the green light. With crowd-drawing events banned in France until the end of August, special arrangements might have to be made for the start of the Tour in Nice, the sports ministry said last month.

Chris Froome fears large crowds even if Tour de France is 'behind closed doors' Read more

“Many people are begging me to keep the Tour even behind closed doors,” Maracineanu told France Television. “I hope it will take place but I am not sure. We do not know what the epidemic will be like after lockdown.”

France’s lockdown, in place since 17 March, will be partially lifted on Monday, although the seasons of several sports championships, including football’s Ligue 1 and rugby’s Top 14, have been abandoned. Maracineanu added that the Tour and tennis’s rescheduled French Open, which will now start on 27 September, could be held behind closed doors should the ban be extended. The news came on the day cycling’s world governing body confirmed the Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a España will overlap in October as the UCI unveiled its revised calendar. The Giro is scheduled to take place from 3-25 October, with a shortened 18-stage Vuelta slated for 20 October to 8 November.

The Giro Rosa, among the highlights of the women’s calendar, will clash with the final week of the Tour de France as it is scheduled for 11-19 September, the week before the UCI’s Road World Championships in Aigle-Martigny, Switzerland.

['John Duerden'],2020-05-05,South Korea ready to kick off football season – with the world watching on,"In a pre-season friendly in the penultimate week of April in South Korea, two Incheon United players picked up water bottles, went to drink, stopped, laughed and then swapped. Name labels on bottles will be easy to adapt to but it remains to be seen if other measures will be widely accepted.

There are sure to be plenty watching to see what happens when the K-League starts on 8 May. South Korea has been a global inspiration in battling coronavirus and now has the chance to provide a similar example in the field of football.

Shorter games under consideration for football's return, says PFA chief Read more

In its 37-year history, the league has never had the kind of attention it will get on Friday evening as the 2020 season finally kicks-off. The year started with a frustrating search for a new domestic broadcasting deal but now media companies from around the world, desperate for live sport, have been knocking on the door of the league’s headquarters in Seoul. Ten international deals have been done – from China to Croatia – with others being negotiated.

“Live football is really rare these days,” Kwon Oh-gap, the president of the K-League, says. “It is a great opportunity to let the world know about Asia’s top league. We hope fans will forget about the virus when they watch the K-League.”

Taiwan and Turkmenistan may still be playing but the K-League, which has produced more Asia champions than any other, is a different level. It should have kicked off on 29 February, the champions Jeonbuk Motors, coached by José Mourinho’s former assistant José Morais, facing the cup holders Suwon Bluewings. That day, however, saw the country record 909 coronavirus cases, its highest number. Now with new local infections down to single digits since mid-April – and down to zero on 4 May – the situation is deemed to be safe enough.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The K League’s promotional video for the start of the season.

“In the process of preparing for the league to begin we consulted with medical experts and their common opinion was that we can consider starting the league when the number of confirmed patients was under 30 for at least two weeks,” Kwon says.

To get from February to May has been a slog with lots of hard work. All 1,100 staff and players were tested last week and within six hours, all came back negative, with the K-League picking up the tab.

There is no concern about football taking resources away from other sectors. Such is South Korea’s capacity it has been exporting tests around the world. Aggressive and extensive testing and tracing have helped it limit the number of deaths to 252 and on 15 April, 66% of a 44 million electorate voted in national elections without any apparent ill-effect.

There is no complacency, however. The 12-team league has already reduced the number of games this season from 38 to 27 and the campaign will be count as long as 22 fixtures are completed.

“The virus has calmed down but it hasn’t completely ended,” the president says. “If a case of the virus is confirmed in a team during the season, then their fixtures, as well as their opponents, will be suspended for at least two weeks.”

Other leagues have been in touch. “Various national football associations have asked questions about the K-League’s step-by-step response process and how to operate in the current situation. We are more than happy to cooperate and share the manual.”

The manual helps map out the process but there will be differences on matchday. There are no fans but that should change sooner rather than later and, like at the Asian Champions League games in February, fans will be wearing masks and have their temperatures taken before entering the stadium.

Post-match interviews will take place on the pitch, not in a cramped stadium corridor, with reporters staying two metres away. There will be no shaking of hands and coaches are exploring ways to get their instructions across while wearing masks.

“Excessive spitting or blowing of the nose is prohibited and players should refrain from close conversations,” says the K-League communication officer, Woo Cheoung-sik. “During the game, players who habitually spit or talk closely will be warned.” Sanctions for those who spit and talk repeatedly and/or deliberately will be decided by the league.

There has been some pushback on this. The Incheon captain, Kim Do-hyeok, said not spitting is fine but not talking is impossible. Officials believe a middle ground will be found with everyone just happy to get back on the pitch.

“Our goal this year is to complete the league,” Woo says. Anything else is a bonus but whatever happens the world will be watching.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/south-korea-ready-to-kick-off-football-season-with-world-watching
['Andrew Lawrence'],2020-05-05,Why is it always the white NFL players who get a second chance?,"Rare is the NFL draft that provokes second guessing about a kicker. But this year’s edition was no ordinary draft (see: 19, Covid.) And Justin Rohrwasser is no ordinary kicker.

When the New England Patriots selected Rohrwasser in the fifth round to replace the legendary Stephen Gostkowski, it was a shock, especially as the 23-year-old hadn’t been considered an exceptional talent in college. ESPN host Trey Wingo was even forced to admit on live TV that the Worldwide Leader in Sports had no highlights of Rohrwasser’s career.

And even if there had been any B-roll of a weather-beaten Rohrwasser blasting three-pointers against Rice or Western Kentucky, none of those images could eclipse the more striking one on his left forearm – of the Roman numeral III ringed in 13 stars. To the untrained eye, the tattoo would seem little more than a marker of youth. To the keener observer, it is the unmistakable brand of the Three Percenters – a far-right paramilitary group that champions gun ownership and resists federal involvement in local matters. Formed in reaction to the 2008 election of Barack Obama, some members of the group took up arms and served as sentries for white supremacist protesters at the 2017 domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, that resulted in 28 injuries and one death.

If athletes like Nick Bosa support Trump they should at least be honest Read more

Rohrwasser, who can be clearly seen exercising his right to bare arms in official team photos, has played the naïf. He told reporters that draft night was the first time he’d heard about the significance of his tattoo, which he says he mistook for a US military symbol. He pledged to ink over it, then promised to laser it off entirely, all the while apologizing to friends and family whom he’d put in the “compromising position” of having to defend the indefensible.

Those attempts at damage control might have sailed through the uprights if he hadn’t followed and “liked” so much far-right social media content. Or recommended books from Jordan Peterson and other radical traditionalists. Or previously bragged about tattooing himself with a sewing needle. Or completely ignored the much bigger tattoo just under his Three Percenters dog whistle that reads “Liberty or Death”. That’s the cry that was last heard by the anti-government protesters who’d sooner drive down to the local statehouse with their guns and exhaust in a policeman’s face than let something as trifling as global pandemic deny them the right to a haircut and a mani-pedi. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer said the demonstrations at her state capitol – which, among other things, featured armed militia men waving Dixie flags and nooses – brought back memories of “some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country.”

So profound is the remorse in Rohrwasser’s heart that he apparently spent a portion of what should have been the happiest day of his life crying in his car, according to an anecdote his high-school coach shared with the Boston Globe. And, shoot, you had to feel for him. Pro football makes it so easy to summon the sympathy. When white players like Rohrwasser get whistled for their supremacist taunts, somehow, they’re the ones who are forgiven. It was true when Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins used a racial epithet to refer to black and Hispanic teammates. (He blamed it on the alcohol.) It was true when Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught on tape threatening to jump a security barrier at a Kenny Chesney concert and “fight every nigger here.” (He blamed it on the alcohol, too.) And it was true when Richie Incognito bullied his teammate Jonathan Martin – “a half-nigger piece of shit,” in Incognito’s estimation – out of the NFL. While Incognito resumed a career to which he’s felt very much entitled, Martin has spent the five years wrestling with his mental health. Collins, Cooper and Incognito all carried on their careers in the NFL, as will Rohrwasser. You could argue that everyone deserves a second chance. Protest about the racism inherent in the US though, and you may well find your football career is over. Or, for that matter, your basketball career.

In a league where nearly two-thirds of the guys in pads are black, it stands to reason that a white player’s ethnic and cultural biases should be judged as harshly as their 40-yard dash times – you know, just to stave off any potential “locker room distractions.” But instead of a sharp examination of an actual weakness that only a white player can weaponize, we get the same ol’ soft focus on black poverty porn. We get an ESPN box on Clemson wideout Tee Higgins that ends with a bullet point about his mom fighting drug addiction for 16 years. We get another bullet in the box on Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault Jr about his mother surviving West Nile virus. We get yet another bullet in the box on Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs about his father dying of heart failure. It’s enough to make you wonder where the bullet point about all the racist and homophobic posts Nick Bosa had liked (and subsequently deleted) before he was taken second overall in last year’s draft.

For a shop run by Jimmy Pitaro – the politically averse ESPN president who has promised, on more than a few occasions, to deliver content that sticks to sports – these digressions are quite far afield indeed. What’s more, every year his network seems to come into the draft with an endless supply of these backstories. (Maybe someday one of the 12,000 draft analysts in ESPN’s employ will find the courage to weigh in.) It’s almost as if there is a stubborn social construct in America that makes it virtually impossible for black athletes to escape the traumatic beats in their humble beginnings.

If ever there was a team owner in the league who might appreciate the irony at work here, it’s the Patriots’ Robert Kraft. Here, after all, is a man who not only works with Meek Mill and Jay-Z on criminal justice reform, but also gives liberally to Blue Lives causes, supports the troops and first responders and counts our law-and-order president among his closest friends. How does a guy like Kraft wind up drafting a guy like Rohrwasser? Easy. His team had a need, and his coach saw something. With a bit of laser removal and a few clutch kicks, likely, Rohrwasser will soon reduce the breathless stories about his rightward leanings to a “West Nile”-sized poverty porn bullet. The most people will remember is that he was called out for his extremist affiliations, he wept. As long as Rohrwasser plays the victim, he can never lose.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/justin-rohrwasser-richie-incognito-nfl-football

Mixed messages emanate from Jerry Seinfeld’s new Netflix special, which introduces a daredevil leaping from a helicopter to get to his gig, then substitutes him for a world-weary sexagenarian, disengaging from life with a dismissive wave of his hand. So which is true? Neither, I should think – as that contradiction cheerfully reminds us, we don’t turn to Seinfeld for personal intimacies. He is Mr Generic, the American everyman who exists on stage to channel our observations of, and mild frustrations with, the business of being alive.

Aged 65, he still does so sublimely – particularly in the first half of this new hour, filmed in New York and featuring material performed in the UK last summer. A wonderful opening sends up the rigmarole of coming out to do a comedy show, just another “hyped-up not necessary special event … put together so we could kill some time”. Why do any of us bother? None of us want to be here, Seinfeld tells us, as if blowing the gaff on some illicit truth. “Nobody wants to be anywhere … Nobody likes anything.”

Seinfeld and chill: why the classic sitcom can help beat lockdown anxiety Read more

Via a detour into Pop-Tarts and pretentious cuisine, subjects with all the cutting-edge of a soup spoon, our host segues (“What else is annoying in the world besides everything?”) into a disquisition on technology, reaping big laughs from our iPhone dependency and the poorly remembered origins of text messaging. Again, familiar standup terrain – but Jerry excavates the novel angle, and brings it to zesty life with exemplary delivery and (witness his dumbshow of cartoon exhaustion as his phone battery dies) unshowy physical comedy.

There’s a lull after this, not redeemed when Seinfeld “changes gears” into more personal material – which turns out to be old-fashioned ’er-indoors shtick about married life. The “women do this, men do that” generalities are a bit off-the-peg. But there are some choice riffs, as his wife complains about his incorrect tone (“I thought it was a marriage; apparently it’s a musical”), and as Jerry frets that his babies are also his replacements. (“Their first words are ‘mam’, ‘dada’ and ‘bye bye’.”) Helicopter sky-dive apart, there’s nothing daring about Seinfeld – but if 23 Hours to Kill is safe, it’s also, usually, sparkling.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/05/jerry-seinfeld-23-hours-to-kill-review-sublime-standup-from-mr-generic
['Sam Jordison'],2020-05-05,Defoe's Plague Year was written in 1722 but speaks clearly to our time,"Reading A Journal of the Plague Year, the first uneasy jolts of recognition come on page one. The narrator tells us that he and his neighbours heard that the plague was “return’d again in Holland” at the beginning of September 1664. We are told the government were given warnings but kept their private counsel; that the people began either to forget this foreign problem, or to regard it “as a thing we were very little concern’d in”.

As I write this in May 2020, the parallels with our initial response to a problem far off in China are so striking that it feels almost ridiculous to point them out. And so it goes: turn the page, and we get the first report of the “weekly Bills” showing the increase in deaths in each parish in London, which are obsessively noted by our narrator throughout his account. The tallies provide their own grim commentary on the terror of the sickness, just like the deaths tolls we’ve been receiving every day for weeks.

Then we find out that these tallies may not be reliable. The authorities’ figures are always low: “The next Bill was from the 23rd of May to the 30th, when the Number of The Plague was 17: But the Burials in St Giles’s were 53, a frightful Number! Of whom they set down but 9 of the Plague.” Later it was discovered at least 20 more “were really dead of the plague”, but had been “set down of the Spotted-Feaver or other Distempers, besides others concealed.” In 1665 as in 2020, the figures for excess deaths give a more useful insight than the number of deaths actually attributed to the infection.

The parallels continue. The narrator notes that the measures necessary to contain the outbreak were taken too late:

I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them, and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sank in that disaster, which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided, and which, if posterity think fit, they may take a caution and warning from.

That’s hard to read, here in posterity. Elsewhere, there are haunting passages about the emptiness of familiar streets, “for when the people came into the streets from the country by Shoreditch and Bishopsgate, or by Old Street and Smithfield, they would see the out-streets empty and the houses and shops shut, and the few people that were stirring there walk in the middle of the streets.”

We can all now recognise his wonder that London should be so quiet. I also felt a queasy recognition of my own habit of walking down the middle of roads to avoid people.

Defoe is also fascinating on self-isolation. We haven’t yet got to the stage of painting red crosses on the doors of infected houses, or posting guards outside so that the people starving and dying inside can’t escape. Nor have we imposed the 40-day isolation period that gives “quarantine” its name. But any reader today will recognise the fear and pity with which the narrator talks about the people who have the disease and may transmit it, especially those who do so unwittingly:

By the well I mean such as had received the contagion, and had it really upon them, and in their blood, yet did not show the consequences of it in their countenances: nay, even were not sensible of it themselves, as many were not for several days. These breathed death in every place, and upon everybody who came near them; nay, their very clothes retained the infection, their hands would infect the things they touched.

Breathed death! Unsurprisingly, everyone in Defoe’s London is jumpy. And it’s not just people they have to fear. There’s little mention of the rats whose fleas transmitted the plague – but there are familiar worries about household pets. Horrifyingly, Defoe notes, “a prodigious number of those creatures were destroyed. I think they talked of 40,000 dogs, and five times as many cats.”

Defoe also tells us of the rich fleeing to the country and taking death with them, noting how the poor are far more exposed to the disease. He describes “quacks and mountebanks” peddling false cures and the poor people who “even poisoned themselves beforehand for fear of the poison of the infection”.

The correspondences are so clear that it feels strange to remember that Defoe was describing events 355 years ago – and that A Journal of the Plague Year, published in 1722, is not even a firsthand account. But in that, at least, there’s hope. It may often feel like Defoe is writing about our present, but this is a book set in the past tense. “A dreadful Plague in London was,” he writes at the end. And this too, shall pass.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/05/defoe-a-journal-of-the-plague-year-1722-our-time
['Scott Tobias'],2020-05-05,Did Gladiator really deserve the best picture Oscar?,"When Gladiator was released in early May 2000, there wasn’t much of an inkling that it would go on to win the Oscar for best picture, for the obvious reason that it was positioned as the first of the summer blockbusters, promoted less for its historical gravitas than its bloody combat in a digitally enhanced Colosseum. In retrospect, it shouldn’t have been a surprise that two and a half hours of speeches, montages and decadent pageantry would fit into a broadcast that’s an hour longer and slightly less violent. But the best picture designation has been an odd stain on Gladiator’s reputation over the years: a film that might have been remembered as a satisfying revenge spectacle instead looks like a second-rate prestige picture.

The Virgin Suicides at 20: Sofia Coppola's debut continues to haunt Read more

Twenty years later, perhaps it’s time to take Gladiator back to its original framing, not as the spoiler to Steven Soderbergh’s unlikely coronation as a Hollywood director – his Erin Brockovich and Traffic were best picture nominees, and he won best director for the latter – but as a classed-up underdog sports movie, like a middle-period Rocky sequel in sandals and tunics. The palace intrigue that follows the death of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius may give the film a certain amount of sophistication, as do the performances by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who all make excellent and multi-layered contributions. Yet this is essentially about an undersized warrior gutting his way to a title bout – all else seems like window-dressing by comparison.

The competitive arc of Gladiator is Rocky III leading into Rocky IV. It’s about our hero first belting his way through a colorful array of opponents – barrel-chested goons, armor-plated archers on chariots, man-eating tigers emerging from the arena floor – before finally battling the villain on hostile turf and turning the home crowd to his favor, against the will of a brutal authoritarian government. Again, this is not a mark against the film, because it’s mostly rousing on these terms, boosted by a Roman succession plot that plays one man’s epic revenge quest to the highest of stakes. But the argument that the film is any deeper than the red-meat savagery it delivers doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. It’s a terrific summer movie, and one of the new century’s least deserving best picture winners.

For director Ridley Scott, it started a run of enervating historical action-dramas that included Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood and Exodus: Gods and Kings, none of which had the same propulsive kick. The benefit of Crowe’s Oscar-winning lead performance – and a script (by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson) that was geared around it – is that he makes it impossible to get lost in the hectic atmosphere Scott conjures here from hundreds of extras, digital landscapes and assorted period bric-a-brac. There’s a lot to draw the eye away from the central action in Scott’s films – Orlando Bloom, for example, doesn’t have the presence to draw focus in Kingdom of Heaven – but Crowe’s General Maximus Decimus Meridius has a simple and well-defined mission, and the actor plays it as righteous as a sword plunged straight to the hilt.

Contrasting the scorched earth of Germania, where Maximus leads his men in one final push against the barbarians (“At my signal, unleash hell!”), with the golden fields of home, where his wife and son await after his years away, Gladiator begins with a patriot’s humble request. In exchange for his service to the empire, he wants a little time off – those fields ain’t gonna harvest themselves, you know? But he gets caught up in circumstances beyond his control: the dying Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) wants him as a placeholder to boost the senate and lead Rome toward democratic rule. But that means passing over his vile, sadistic failson, Commodus (Phoenix), who craves the unfettered power of an emperor and unnaturally shortens his father’s life to get it. Commodus condemns Maximus to a quiet execution in the forest, orders his family murdered and sets about engineering the dissolution of the senate and a comprehensive quashing of dissent.

When Maximus is picked up by slavers in Zucchabar, a Roman city that would now be in Algeria, and he’s forced to battle to the death alongside other gladiators – first in local events and later in the Colosseum, where he becomes a sensation. The fun irony is that the feckless Commodus has brought the gladiators to Rome as a bread-and-circuses initiative to distract the great unwashed while he seizes total authority over the empire. Now with Maximus besting all comers in front of lusty boobirds turned super-fans, chanting his name like the Soviets rooting for Rocky, Commodus’s hold on the throne is becoming more tenuous.

Phoenix is a wonderfully hissable villain as Commodus, a legacy brat who understands his own absence of nobility and honor as liberating qualities – like any good tyrant, he sees a clean conscience as a terrible obstacle to his ambition. But most of the behind-the-scenes complexity comes courtesy of Nielsen as Lucilla, Commodus’s sister and Maximus’s former lover, who acts with political expediency in order to survive, but asserts herself firmly in the shadows. Lucilla is a glimpse into what Gladiator might have been if its priorities were directed more toward the machinations of government rather than the machinations of separating a man’s limbs or head from the rest of his body.

The action sequences in Gladiator dance right on the edge of coherence, which may have something to do with the difficulty of matching live-action with digital backdrops, but mostly falls in line with popular action directors like Michael Bay or Scott’s brother, Tony, who were favoring movement and viscera over the nuts-and-bolts of clear blocking. When Maximus is battling an undefeated chest-thumping hulk twice his size named Tigris and actual tigers appear in support, it becomes obvious that we’re being treated to a bread-and-circuses gorefest along with the Roman commoners. And once you come to that realization, Gladiator no longer seems like a bid for respectability. It had respectability imposed on it.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/05/gladitor-ridley-scott-russell-crowe-best-picture-oscar
['Alexis Petridis'],2020-05-05,Dave Greenfield: putting beauty at the rotten heart of the Stranglers,"Music writer Pete Paphides’ recent memoir, Broken Greek, contains a vivid description of its seven-year-old author encountering the Stranglers for the first time, during a 1977 Top of the Pops appearance. “They landed in the living room while I was totally unsupervised,” he writes, “and scared the shit [out] of me. By now I would have seen images of punk rockers … but they looked like circus entertainers compared to [the Stranglers]. They looked too old to be punk. They looked like the sort of people you pass in the street and your mother puts her arm round you, stares at the pavement and doubles her walking speed … The point at which it all got too much was when the camera cut to Dave Greenfield – who has died from Covid-19 aged 71 – jabbing his keyboard while looking straight ahead with what seemed, beyond doubt, to be the eyes of a murderer, an effect somehow compounded by the army-surplus boiler suit he had decided to wear. Just like that, my list of phobias had got a little longer: worms, biting into mushrooms, insects, the fibreglass King Kong which stood next to a ring road in Birmingham city centre and, now, Dave Greenfield from the Stranglers.”

It’s funny writing, but it’s also very incisive about the Stranglers: in real life Greenfield was, by all accounts, the band’s most approachable and charming member, but otherwise Paphides has it spot-on. The Stranglers complained relentlessly about not being accepted by the punk cognoscenti, but what did they expect? They didn’t look like punks, particularly Greenfield, who defiantly sported that least punk of facial accoutrements, a moustache. They were old, at least by the standards of the day, old enough to have the kind of musical pasts it was wise to keep your mouth shut about in the scorched-earth environment created by the Sex Pistols: Hugh Cornwell had played bass in a band with Richard Thompson, later of Fairport Convention; Greenfield had been in a prog rock band called Rusty Butler.

Worse, Greenfield declined to keep his mouth shut about his past, at least metaphorically speaking. He played keyboards, sometimes several at once: nothing compared to the banks of equipment behind which Rick Wakeman plied his trade, but far more than most punk bands would countenance. Sometimes his playing recalled the reedy organ sounds found on 60s garage rock singles by ? and the Mysterians or the Standells, which was just about acceptable under punk rules. More often, he played exactly like someone who’d been in a prog rock band, decorating songs with complex arpeggios, which absolutely wasn’t. Moreover, his playing was the Stranglers’ signature sound: with the greatest of respect to Hugh Cornwell’s gruff vocals, or Jean-Jacques Burnel’s fluid bass playing, when you think of the Stranglers’ most famous songs – from Peaches and No More Heroes to Waltzinblack and Golden Brown – you think first of Greenfield’s keyboards.

His contributions were the solitary aspect of the Stranglers’ music you might describe as beautiful. Everything else about them was as relentlessly, wilfully nasty as their song titles suggested: Ugly, Tits, Bring on the Nubiles, Nice N’ Sleazy, Peasant in the Big Shitty, Down in the Sewer and – oh God – I Feel Like a Wog. If it makes for profoundly uncomfortable listening now – “problematic” barely begins to cover the lyrical content – their music had a remarkable power, a sense of unceasing, misanthropic hostility. But they sounded less like a punk band than a band that predated punk, that sprang out of that weird, liminal period immediately prior to 1976, where the bleakness of mid-70s Britain had seeped into rock’s fringes – the tougher end of the pub-rock scene, the more thuggish bits of late-period glam – but not yet become codified into series of musical diktats. Which is precisely what they were: they had formed in 1974 as the Guildford Stranglers, Greenfield joining a year later.

It meant that the Stranglers were always regarded with suspicion by the music press – a state of affairs not helped much by the band’s propensity for violence – but it also meant that the Stranglers weren’t constrained by punk. Grimly powerful as their debut album Rattus Norvegicus and its follow-up No More Heroes were, there’s a compelling argument that the band really hit their stride on 1978’s Black and White, by which time Greenfield’s keyboard playing had become more expansive and experimental. It’s never really hailed as such, but Black and White has a claim to be the first post-punk album: the taut dance rhythms, jagged guitars and synthesiser tones of Enough Time and Threatened, the attempt to meld dub reggae with Captain Beefheart on In the Shadows, the claustrophobic racket of Curfew and the stabbing, angular, curiously homoerotic Death and Night and Blood (Yukio) were all adventurous explorations beyond stripped-down rock’n’roll.

On the best of their subsequent singles, Greenfield seemed ever-more integral: their extraordinary cover of Walk On By – on which the Stranglers somehow contrived to turn Dionne Warwick’s exquisite original into six minutes of brooding, barely contained aggression – was dominated by his organ playing; his rolling piano underpinned Don’t Bring Harry, an authentically chilling song about heroin; on 1979’s fantastic Duchess, his arpeggios are no longer a striking embellishment, but appeared to have consumed the band’s sound entirely. And then there was Golden Brown, which seemed astonishing at the time – a Stranglers single that got played on Radio 2! – and seems more astonishing still in retrospect: a harpsichord-led song about heroin in a strange time signature that went to No 2 in the charts. The lyrics were frontman Hugh Cornwell’s, but it was Greenfield’s show: he wrote the music with drummer Jet Black, his performance is the song’s heart.

The Stranglers: how we made European Female Read more

They were adaptable enough to keep having hits long after most of their peers had split up or faded away, but a certain sense of diminishing returns eventually set in: by the time of 1990’s 10, they sounded perilously close to being Another Rock Band, not an accusation even their loudest detractors could have pinned on the authors of No More Heroes or the deranged concept album The Gospel According to the Meninblack.

Yet the Stranglers proved to be weirdly unstoppable – neither the departure of Cornwell nor the retirement of Jet Black, aged 78, really dented their live following. That might have been the flipside of the Stranglers’ lack of critical acclaim or latterday reappraisal, and the kind of refusal to play by the era’s rules that Greenfield seemed to embody: never fashionable to start off with, they weren’t subject to fashion’s vagaries, instead building a huge, devoted cult following born out of being outsiders.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/05/dave-greenfield-putting-beauty-at-the-rotten-heart-of-the-stranglers

So what have her colleagues said about the film?

'I haven’t seen it. I've heard it's terrible': match the Cats cast member to their quote

Dame Judi Dench’s interview in the new issue of Vogue is a lovely thing, touching on everything from her early career in the theatre to her thoughts on the outbreak. But that isn’t why you’ll read it. No, you’ll read it to witness Dame Judi Dench struggle to describe her Cats costume. She has several attempts at it. She looked like “a battered, mangy old cat,” she said. Like “a great big orange bruiser”. Her cloak alone looked like “five foxes fucking on my back”. You sense that Judi Dench isn’t necessarily the biggest fan of Cats.

Dench’s comments are a welcome inclusion to my favourite form of 2020 entertainment; the stars of Cats reacting to Cats. Because you can tell a lot about a person by how they respond to their participation in what is destined to be an eternal punchline. Do they stand by the director? Do they remain professional and rise above the baffled din? Or do they give up all pretence of dignity and, like Dench, slag it off just as hard as everyone else?

For fun, I have unearthed some quotes by the stars of Cats, varying from outright horror to brave professionalism.

['Kate Hutchinson'],2020-05-05,Kelly Lee Owens: ‘I still have to fight to not be seen as ‘just the singer’’,"Kelly Lee Owens is showing me her crumpled bed, pixelated on the screen. It is five weeks into quarantine and this has quickly become the norm: an interview with an artist in their close quarters; ambivalent levels of grooming. Neither of us is wearing makeup, and neither of us care. “You know what I read?” begins the electronic musician, incredulously. “This is bullshit. There’s a [Daily Mail] headline saying that women’s breasts will be sagging because they’re not going to be wearing bras during this lockdown. So what?! Leave me to my saggy breasts.”

The Guide: Staying In – sign up for our home entertainment tips Read more

And so it is over FaceTime, Owens in a black turtleneck top, two gold heart-shaped pendants dangling from her lobes, and occasionally a flash of Walthamstow, north-east London, through her window. The earrings belonged to Owens’s “nana”, to whom she was incredibly close and who passed away last year. “She was there two minutes after I was born and I was with her when she died,” she says, her tone darkening. “I was holding her, talking her through her death.

“I’ll show you, actually, I’ve got this shrine,” she says, heading over to her dresser and pointing to an assortment of candles, a playing card in the middle. “She signed it with her name, Jeanette, and that’s one of the tracks on my new album. I think it’s important to have a place to connect.”

That album is called Inner Song and its release has been pushed back from May until August. It is an obvious blow for Owens after the momentum of her self-titled debut in 2017, which made many a publication’s end-of-year list, with its deliriously buoyant techno-pop, as dreamy as it was pumping. She is trying to remain upbeat but says the decision was to stand in “solidarity” with record shops, which have had to temporarily close.

When Owens moved from Wales to London in her 20s, she worked at Pure Groove records, where she met many DJs who encouraged her to pursue music. She had always been Team Indie, with a stint in the shoegaze band the History of Apple Pie, but the sessions for her former co-worker Daniel Avery’s Drone Logic album, on which she provided her hypnagogic vocals, turned her on to techno. Watching her friend in the studio with her future engineer, Ghost Culture, she says, “it seemed like they were crafting magic”.

Owens decided to craft magic of her own, ditched her band and started performing as a one-woman Berghain with synths and guitar. But as her popularity grew, her personal life started going south and she wasn’t enjoying her breakthrough success. “A relationship that I was in was quite destructive,” she says. “Me being me, I just powered through.” But then, “there were times when I was in bed, and I couldn’t move,” she admits. “I was trying to juggle lots of things to keep different people happy, and neglecting myself.” It’s a familiar story for women, putting others’ happiness ahead of our own. “We’re actually taught to do that, I think,” Owen agrees.

And so she went through a period of having to, as one song title goes, “re-wild” herself. She read Clarissa Pinkola Estés’s Women Who Run With the Wolves, spent time in nature, did free writing and undertook a “body release trauma session”, which involved the rather intense experience of having someone stare into your eyes for five minutes. The week after that, she says, “I wrote most of the lyrics for the album – I could be honest with myself and I could feel the losses, all the things I’d been holding in.”

Owens understands the role of healing more than most: in her late teens, while others would be waiting tables, she worked as an auxiliary nurse in a cancer ward, “holding people’s hand as they die”. The job gave her a unique insight into death. “Hearing is supposedly the last thing that goes,” she says, and so, when her grandmother died, “everyone was around her, holding her hands, telling her they loved her. That’s one of the ways to die well.

“This sounds really weird,” she adds, “but I feel like later on in life I might become a death doula. We need to have more conversations about death, and I’m not afraid of that.”

It is obviously devastating to consider that, right now, people aren’t able to see their loved ones as they pass. “People are dying alone and it’s a very serious thing,” Owens nods, although she has been thinking about alternative comforts. “I know it’s a pandemic, but maybe there could be their favourite scent in the room, or maybe there could be music playing,” she suggests. “It’s obviously not easy to do any of this, and the NHS is struggling, but I can’t help but think of little ways that would help ease [their pain].”

She recently dedicated a playlist of calming tracks to care workers, some of whom she is still in touch with from her hospital days, and who she is understandably concerned about. “The PPE [shortage] is absolutely huge,” says Owens. “I know a lot of doctors who are refusing to work, and I fully support them in that. The government is putting it as a war, so we have ‘heroes’, and actually all they’re doing is what they’d normally do with wars, which is to sacrifice people.”

Death crops up a little on Inner Song, including the destruction of the planet on the climate-crisis banger Melt!. But the album is also concerned with finding your way back to yourself. In a way, the making of it has been preparation for a scenario like the current moment: many of her lyrics suggest finding strength in solitude, atop kosmische soundscapes and 2-step beats. Owens’s voice is front and centre this time, instead of acting as another instrument, and we hear a lone male voice, too, on “psychedelic lullaby” Corner of My Sky: that of John Cale, whom she had asked to read a poem. It’s still rare to hear a lone male vocal on a piece of electronic music produced by a woman. “That’s quite bizarre, isn’t it,” ponders Owens, “but I think you’re right.”

It was her “insistence”, she laughs, that resulted in her and friend Jon Hopkins making the ambient-trance song Luminous Spaces in January. Originally a remix of his track Luminous Beings, Owens did the arrangement and added vocals, and it became something new entirely, even otherworldly. So it was disappointing for Owens to see the part she played diminished.

“Unfortunately, all the comments on YouTube are like: ‘Jon’s a wizard, he’s amazing,’” she says. “His production is amazing, but I took that track and made it what it is. And he’ll tell you that.

“It’s boring,” she continues, “but I still have to fight my corner, because if I don’t I’m passed off as ‘just the singer’. Why are we presuming that if a woman’s voice is on something, it’s the only thing she’s contributed? We have to keep undoing those preconceptions.”

You can hear traces of Hopkins’s style of thwacking rave on her new song, Night, but that might not be the only influence he’s had. In a previous interview, Owens told me that the late, great DJ Andrew Weatherall had come into Pure Groove once and asked her: “Kelly, do you take drugs? Because I’ve heard your track Lucid,” one of her more mind-altering productions. Has that changed? Hopkins’s last record was, after all, partly inspired by trips on DMT. She ripples with laughter. “Let’s just say with the track, Corner of My Sky, that might be what microdosing mushrooms sounds like. Maybe!”

Owens is keen to find positives everywhere she possibly can. She recently tweeted the definition of the word “apocalypse”, to mean “revelation – an unveiling or unfolding of things not previously known”. Does she think, then, that there could be tiny positives to the pandemic at all? “I do, and that’s just because I’m in a very privileged position to say it,” she says. “I’m hyper-aware of how you can come across when you say: ‘This is good for the planet.’ But it also is important to point out the duality of consciousness, and raise awareness of what can happen when we are apathetic.”

The track on her album, Wake-Up, points to this idea, too. “One of the things [it questions],” she says, “is never pausing to take it in, always avoiding your sense of dread.” A world-changing event like this “forces us to ask important questions. Globally, we are connecting now. That’s what’s important.”

['Ammar Kalia'],2020-05-05,Hollywood's Jeremy Pope: 'Is there room for another black man like me?',"‘Can all of us be in the same room at the same time?,” Jeremy Pope asks over the phone from his home in Los Angeles. It is over a month into lockdown, but he isn’t questioning the rules of physical distancing. Rather, the 27-year-old is pondering the unspoken rules of Hollywood prejudice – who gets to share a platform with whom, and whether there’s only space for one minority figure at any given time.

Pope’s latest project – his first major TV role – is in Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series Hollywood, a revisionist story set in 1940s Golden Age tinseltown, where he plays Archie, a gay, black screenwriter who is trying to break into the industry. It is a story he could relate to.

“What’s brilliant about our series is that you have a powerful man like Ryan Murphy who is capable of making any type of TV he wants, and then he makes a show like this – showing the world what it could have been,” Pope says. “And I am what it can be, he’s given me my debut TV opportunity. I often feel very similar to Archie and I wonder: is there room for another black man like me?”

Hollywood is a lascivious, lustful take on a much-mythologised era, centred on a group of fledgling stars: Pope’s Archie, whose retelling of Peg Entwistle’s suicide is picked up by director Raymond (Darren Criss), and actors Jack (David Corenswet) and Camille (Laura Harrier). Criss and Corenswet are established actors of the Murphy stable, having starred in his previous productions such as Glee, The Politician and The Assassination of Gianni Versace, yet for Pope, Hollywood – the show and the town – was an unfamiliar experience.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘I was really excited about this story’ ... Pope as Archie in Hollywood. Photograph: Saeed Adyani/NETFLIX

“I was coming to the end of what I called my marathon when I was cast,” he says. “I was doing eight shows a week on Broadway of Ain’t Too Proud and that was right on the back of Choir Boy, so when I got the call to audition, I was exhausted.” Both shows were tales of the black American experience, albeit in very different ways; Choir Boy was a journey of self-discovery set in an elite prep school and penned by Moonlight’s Tarell Alvin McCraney, while Ain’t Too Proud was a musical based on the career of the Motown group the Temptations. Both performances earned Pope Tony nominations, making him only the sixth person in its 73-year history to be up for two awards in one season.

When he was offered the role of Archie, it was for an “untitled Ryan Murphy project” and he had no idea what it would entail. “When I met Ryan, we just had a great open dialogue about the show and it was a very collaborative process,” he says. “I soon became really excited about this story and representing a powerful black gay writer in the 1940s, but I needed to be reassured that there were directors and writers that represented me on the show, too.”

That support namely came in the form of longtime Murphy collaborator and Hollywood co-writer and co-director Janet Mock. “Janet was my ride or die,” he says. “We got to really dig into these characters and talk about the racial acrobatics these people had to go through. We know how hard it must have been to just be a coloured man in the 40s but then to also be an out gay man? It’s like you already walk into a room with two strikes.”

Archie’s scenes in the show are often highly demanding and emotional, tearfully confronting studio executives who seek to erase his experience or demanding recognition in the face of prejudice and privilege, yet Pope found it disconcertingly easy to tap into his narrative. “Doing eight shows a week in theatre means I can deliver that intensity once, or eight times or even 12 – I can bring that discipline,” he says, “but even more than that, with these scenes I would just think about people like Hattie McDaniel, who was the first woman of colour to win an Academy award. But she wasn’t allowed in the ceremony and when she did win, the Academy had written a speech for her. So, I would feel the pain that she had to go through to be a beacon of light for people like me. It’s so heartbreaking and it made me ask just how high am I allowed to dream?”

For Pope, that battle to dream big continues. “It’s easy for me to go back to a moment in my life where I felt that maybe I wasn’t good enough or I wasn’t allowed to stand in my truth when I was playing Archie,” he says, referencing his teenage years in Orlando, Florida and trying to become an actor and singer. “Hollywood is a period piece but we can still identify with the struggles of the characters today – we’re still fighting for equal opportunities for women, for people of colour, for the LGBTQ community. I just hope that this show continues to inspire our generation of artists to keep fighting to establish that there is room for all of us.”

In the meantime, Pope is spending his lockdown with a well-deserved break from the rigours of filming, “making music, writing and learning how to bake my grandmother’s pound cake”. “In these past couple of weeks I’ve just been able to think of all the moments we’ve had thus far and how great they have been,” he says – taking in the entirety of his community into his third person “we”. “I know that when I get back to work, we will be on that mission just as aggressively as we were before.”

"['Alexandra Villarreal', 'Francine Prose', 'Robert Reich']",2020-05-05,Scared and sick amid Covid-19: US nursing home workers afraid to blow the whistle,"Staff at a New Jersey nursing home say some have contracted the virus and describe insufficient protection as they interact with residents, endangering everyone involved

Workers at a New Jersey nursing home ravaged by coronavirus have described a culture of silence, gross inaction from management and a desperate lack of protective equipment that has put them and their families in harm’s way and made it largely impossible to protect their patients from the outbreak.

AristaCare at Cedar Oaks, a long term 230-bed care facility, had seen 106 confirmed coronavirus cases and 29 deaths reported as of last week. It’s one of 508 long term care facilities with outbreaks in New Jersey alone. According to a list collected by the Washington Post, around 1,350 nursing homes nationwide have reported Covid-19 cases, though the newspaper admits this is an undercount.

Covid-19 has killed thousands in nursing homes across the country. Yet healthcare professionals who were already overworked have agreed to longer hours and have continually put themselves in danger to care for their patients.

A pattern has emerged across America: workers on the frontlines – primarily people of color and immigrants – have been abandoned with insufficient PPE. Nurses and nursing assistants, meanwhile, are terrified that if they blow the whistle, they’ll lose their jobs.

AristaCare staff largely spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity for fear of consequences at work. Some have contracted Covid-19, and all described insufficient, inadequate or irregular provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) as they interact directly with residents, endangering everyone involved.

Amid the pandemic, AristaCare did limit visitation and mandated screenings at the door for anyone entering the facility. But inside, the situation devolved quickly, staff say. One worker watched as roommates infected one another and died from the virus, and alleged that management acted too late. She said one resident only moved floors recently, despite showing signs of Covid-19 weeks before.

“They’re trying to clean it up now for it to look good,” she said. “But we already lost a lot of residents.”

The worker has somehow managed to stay healthy, even as her colleagues fall ill. She gets home, goes immediately to her basement, takes a shower, puts her clothes in the sink and uses Lysol on her coat and shoes.

“I’m very concerned,” she said.

Sherry-Ann Ramkaran, a certified nursing assistant, and another employee, both of whom were sick, said that early into the public health crisis they had been directed not to wear masks around the patients in their care. One of them said she was told it would make the residents feel bad.

“Bottom line is, I know I contracted the virus there, at work,” the woman said.

Ramkaran had been performing mandatory temperature checks and asking questions of everyone coming in and out of the home before she started running a fever in late March and later tested positive for Covid-19.

“I was the first case in my house, first one to get sick,” Ramkaran said. “And I passed it along to my family, which is not a good gift to give.”

AristaCare at Cedar Oaks did not return multiple requests for comment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released guidance for nursing homes and long-term care facilities recommending that available face masks be reserved for healthcare personnel, who should also be reminded not to come in if they’re sick and educated about their facility’s new policies.

Workers at AristaCare, however, described flimsy, cheap masks they were originally provided as PPE. They said some people had come into work sick, and one nurse had even been given a hard time for reporting her symptoms, her colleague said.

Ever-changing guidance from the CDC was posted around the facility, but staff were never privy to any real knowledge, beyond basic reviews of hand-washing practices, about protocols during the pandemic, some said.

In the absence of leadership, workers chronicled a piecemeal game of telephone, where information about how to handle the outbreak came mostly from news outlets and each other.

“They didn’t prepare us for any of this. They didn’t come and say, ‘oh, you know, so-and-so is going on, and we all need to be prepared and be extra careful,’” said Ramkaran. “They didn’t give us any kind of notice.”

As some workers call out tired, sick or afraid, others now have to shoulder an even heavier load in an industry already infamous for chronic understaffing. At AristaCare at Cedar Oaks, nurses have sometimes watched over 32 or even 64 patients – not necessarily a dramatic increase compared to before the pandemic, but a distribution one nurse nevertheless called “impossible”. A different employee said she had clocked in for nonstop, back-to-back shifts over a two-week period.

“I hope that there is a real awareness that we owe them more than to name them as heroes, and that we have an obligation to see them as workers without whose work, whose labor, we wouldn’t be able to survive this pandemic,” said Milly Silva, an executive vice president at 1199SEIU, the country’s largest healthcare union.

Ramkaran thought her Covid symptoms were simply exhaustion; at one point, she worked around 90 hours in just over a week.

New Jersey nursing homes are primarily staffed by immigrant women whose situation Silva said reflects a larger conversation around immigrant labor in the US. The caregivers are deemed essential, she said, but they’re simultaneously not seen as the “full human being” that they are.

Ramkaran has been ill since 24 March, but AristaCare has only paid her 37 hours of sick leave, despite her being a 10-year veteran with the company. She feels certain she contracted the disease while at work, a possibility her human resources contact initially dismissed.

“When they told me I didn’t get the virus at the job, I was really disappointed and hurt,” Ramkaran said. Because she had taken on extra shifts, the only places she spent time before showing Covid symptoms were at AristaCare and home, she said.

As Ramkaran’s family members cared for her, they too got sick, and both her asthmatic daughter and husband with respiratory and heart problems have tested positive for Covid-19. Her husband required two hospital visits as his oxygen levels dropped.

“I can’t wait for this to be over,” she said.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/us-nursing-homes-coronavirus-outbreak
['Julia Kollewe'],2020-05-05,WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann sues SoftBank over $3bn deal,"Adam Neumann, WeWork’s co-founder and former chief executive, has filed a lawsuit against Japan’s SoftBank, accusing it of abusing its power in order to terminate an agreement to buy $3bn (£2.4bn) of stock from him and other early investors in the office-sharing company.

SoftBank, which is run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son who is also WeWork’s biggest investor, announced in early April that it was walking away from the share tender rescue deal hammered out last October to save WeWork from collapse.

It said at the time it had “no choice” but to scrap the rescue deal because WeWork had failed to meet several conditions. It also cited concerns about “multiple, new, and significant pending criminal and civil investigations”.

Neumann would have been the biggest beneficiary of the payouts to minority shareholders, as he was lined up to sell $970m worth of shares.

The lawsuit, filed in a Delaware court, said Softbank and its Vision Fund had let down Neumann and WeWork staff.

“Mr Neumann put his trust in [SoftBank and the Vision Fund] to be stewards of WeWork, which he — and thousands of others — had worked so hard to build,” the lawsuit said.

Neumann had upheld his end of the bargain, according to the filing, while WeWork’s Japanese investors had not.

“The abuses committed by [SoftBank] and SBVF [SoftBank Vision Fund] are so brazen that they have prompted legal action by a special committee of WeWork’s board,” the lawsuit added.

﻿Responding to Neumann’s lawsuit, Rob Townsend, the SoftBank chief legal officer, said: “SoftBank will vigorously defend itself against these meritless claims.”

He added: “Under the terms of our agreement, which Adam Neumann signed, SoftBank had no obligation to complete the tender offer in which Mr Neumann – the biggest beneficiary – sought to sell nearly $1bn in stock.”

Neumann resigned as chief executive last September from the firm he co-founded in 2010, after scrapping plans for a stock market flotation. Investors balked at the company’s sky-high valuation. It had been valued at $47bn, despite losing $3bn in the past three years, but that valuation was slashed to $8bn by the time of the bailout in October.

SoftBank has been losing money on its investments and last week predicted a wider full-year loss of 900bn yen (£6.8bn). It expects to lose £5.3bn from its investment in WeWork alone.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/wework-adam-neumann-sues-softbank-deal
"['Kari Paul', 'Francine Prose', 'Robert Reich']",2020-05-04,Amazon executive resigns over company’s ‘chickenshit’ firings of employee activists,"Tim Bray’s departure comes as company faces increased scrutiny and employee activism around its Covid-19 response

Tim Bray, a top engineer and vice-president at Amazon, announced on Monday he is resigning “in dismay” over the company’s firing of employee activists who criticized working conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Bray’s resignation comes as Amazon faces increased scrutiny and employee activism surrounding its internal response to coronavirus. Amazon workers on Friday participated in a nationwide sick-out to protest against poor working conditions and inadequate safety protections, claiming the company has failed to provide enough face masks for workers, did not implement regular temperature checks it promised at warehouses, and has refused to give workers paid sick leave.

In a blogpost explaining his resignation, Bray called the firings of organizers at the company “chickenshit”, and said they were “designed to create a climate of fear”. In resigning, Bray has become the highest-ranking corporate employee at Amazon to publicly speak out about worker conditions.

“Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” Bray, who had worked at the company for nearly six years, said.

The Guardian previously published Bray’s blogpost in full under Creative Commons licensing, but took it down at his request.

Bray cited the experiences of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa – two user experience designers at Amazon who were fired in April after publicly denouncing the treatment of warehouse workers.

Bray also cited activism among warehouse workers themselves, including actions from Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Bashir Mohammed and Chris Smalls – all of whom were fired after organizing.

A leaked memo obtained by Vice News showed how an Amazon executive denigrated Smalls, who had helped organize an action at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse, labeling him as “not smart or articulate” in a meeting with Jeff Bezos.

Amazon did not respond to a request for comment, but previously cited violations of internal policies as reasons for dismissing these employees.

Amazon made more than $33m per hour in the first three months of the year, according to earnings reports last week, boosted by consumers on lockdown ordering supplies to be delivered to home. The chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, who was already the richest man in the world, has personally seen his fortune swell by $13bn this month to $145bn.

“At the end of the day, the big problem isn’t the specifics of Covid-19 response,” Bray said. “It’s that Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only that’s not just Amazon, it’s how 21st-century capitalism is done.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/04/amazon-tim-bray-resigns-working-conditions-coronavirus
"['Poppy Noor', 'Francine Prose', 'Robert Reich']",2020-05-04,A tale of two cities: how New York police enforce social distancing by the color of your skin,"A tale of two cities: how New York police enforce social distancing by the color of your skin

As New York saw temperatures climb past the 70s this weekend, a more relaxed approach to social distancing was out in force. New Yorkers, starved for fresh air and sunlight, took advantage of the weather to visit parks and go to the beach. In response, over 1,000 NYPD officers were deployed across New York’s five borough to enforce social distancing mandates, with police officers reminding people to maintain 6ft of distance and to wear face masks.

But some have complained of a tale of two very different cities when it comes to how those guidelines have been enforced. In particular, outrage has sparked over juxtaposed images that show officers handing out masks to white sunbathers, while another video shows an officer punching a person of color and sitting on him following a dispute about social distancing.

This is beyond ridiculous at this point. pic.twitter.com/pY6kSGVEaZ

The video footage recorded in Manhattan’s East Village shows an officer approaching a man and hitting him several times in the face before pushing him to the ground and kneeling on his neck.

The NYPD has confirmed that the officer, now identified as Francisco Garcia, has since been stripped of his badge and his gun and the incident is under internal review.

Daquan Owens, a bystander who uploaded the video of the arrest to social media, told New York Daily News that the police reaction was uncalled for.

“The guy that just got slammed to the floor and punched, he was just standing there saying, ‘They didn’t do nothing,’ and actually they didn’t do nothing,” Owens told the Daily News.

“Nothing was going on, nothing provoked the cop. He just got up, pulled his Taser out … The cop, I guess he was frustrated and took his frustration out on the guy,” said Owens.

In a statement, the NYPD confirmed that the incident concerned social distancing protocol to begin with, but had escalated as marijuana was observed at the scene and that one person “took a fighting stance against officer [Garcia]”.

“A group was observed standing on the corner … in violation of social distancing orders. Officers instructed the group disperse and while most complies [sic], some refused. As officers approached, they observed a bag of alleged marijuana in plain view … A third individual was ordered by an officer to disperse and this male took a fighting stance against the officer and was also taken into custody,” an official NYPD spokesperson said.

Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea both acknowledged the incident in a joint press briefing Sunday. “It started out as a social distancing enforcement … I am aware of the video that’s out there,” said Shea. Mayor de Blasio said he was “really disturbed” by the footage in a tweet on Sunday evening.

Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) Saw the video from the Lower East Side and was really disturbed by it. The officer involved has been placed on modified duty and an investigation has begun. The behavior I saw in that video is simply not acceptable.

['David Smith'],2020-05-04,Senate rejects Joe Biden's request to search for records on Tara Reade,"Senate secretary said legal counsel advised that ‘the secretary has no discretion to disclose any such information’

The US Senate has rejected a request from Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, to search for and release any records of a 1993 complaint against him from an aide who has accused him of sexual assault.

The former vice-president gave his first TV interview on the matter on Friday, flatly denying former aide Tara Reade’s allegation that when he was a senator from Delaware he pushed her against a wall and assaulted her.

Biden also wrote to Julie Adams, the secretary of the Senate, requesting that she locate and make public any paper trail relating to a complaint Reade says she made to the Senate personnel office.

But on Monday the secretary said the Senate legal counsel had reviewed relevant laws and, based on strict confidentiality requirements, advised that “the secretary has no discretion to disclose any such information as requested in Vice-President Biden’s letter of 1 May”.

The Biden campaign responded with three questions: can the Senate disclose whether the records exist; is there anyone to whom the records could be lawfully disclosed; and can the Senate release any procedures used by the office that would have overseen a sexual harassment complaint in the 1990s.

The decision left more questions than answers and was seized on by Republicans. Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, wrote in an email: “Joe Biden’s attempt to offer faux transparency ground to a screeching halt this morning.”

Guest accused Biden of sending the media on “a wild goose chase” to look for records in the National Archives, which said it does not hold them, and then to the Senate.

The existence or otherwise of records at the Senate, National Archives and University of Delaware has become a vital piece of the jigsaw in the allegation against Biden, who said on Friday that he was not aware of any complaint on file.

Biden told MSNBC: “This is an open book. There’s nothing for me to hide.”

Reade has said she filed a complaint at the time of the alleged incident and was subsequently fired. But she said last week that the complaint did not explicitly accuse Biden of sexual assault.

“I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,” she told the Associated Press. “I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.”

Reade subsequently tweeted that the AP report was “false”. She also said she had been threatened.

Reade was among eight women who alleged last year that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with unwanted touching or displays of affection. He apologised, then appeared to make light of the matter.

After Biden effectively secured the Democratic nomination to face Donald Trump in November, Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in his Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993, alleged Biden pinned her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office, reached under her skirt and pushed his fingers inside her.

Reade, 56, said she was reluctant to share details of the assault during initial conversations with reporters more than a year ago because she was still coming to terms with the incident and feared a backlash. Two of her associates said last week she had conversations with them that corroborated aspects of her allegation.

Numerous Democratic leaders and figures in the #MeToo movement have shown solidarity with Biden. Republicans have accused them of hypocrisy, arguing they have been zealous in believing women who have accused Trump and other conservatives of assault.

The president has faced multiple accusations of assault and harassment, all of which he denies.

Maureen Dowd, a columnist at the New York Times, observed: “Democrats always set standards that come back and bite them. They have created a cage of their own making.”

But Trump himself, trailing Biden in numerous polls, has been uncharacteristically hesitant to weigh in. In an interview with the conservative radio host Dan Bongino, he said if the accusations were false, Biden should deny them.

“Just go out and fight it, it’s one of those things,” Trump advised. “I’ve been a total victim of this nonsense, false accusations.”

Biden has, however, drawn criticism from the left of the Democratic party. Nina Turner, who was national co-campaign chair for Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the Democratic race and endorsed Biden, told Reuters: “It can’t appear that [Reade] is being ignored just because it’s an inconvenient truth for certain people in the Democratic party.”

Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act as a senator but came under fire for his handling of Anita Hill’s 1991 Senate testimony against now supreme court justice Clarence Thomas.

He said last Friday on MSNBC: “Believing women means taking the woman’s claim seriously when she steps forward, and then vet it, look into it. That’s true in this case as well …

“But in the end, the truth is what matters, and in this case, the truth is the claims are false.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/04/joe-biden-tara-reade-senate-records-reject-request
['Patrick Greenfield'],2020-05-04,Carnival to resume cruises in August despite infections and deaths on ships,"Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry’s possible role in spreading the disease around the planet.

In a statement on Monday, the operator said eight cruise ships would resume operations from 1 August, sailing from Galveston, Texas, and Miami and Port Canaveral in Florida, once a no-sail order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had expired.

Tasmania coronavirus outbreak traced to two Ruby Princess passengers Read more

The CDC has issued repeated warnings that cruise travel has spread the coronavirus outbreak around the world and on Friday, the US Congress announced an investigation of Carnival Cruise Line’s parent company – Carnival Corporation – over why it did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff.

In response to the announcement, the CDC said it had not discussed timelines for resuming cruise travel with any operators, adding “we do not have enough information to say when it will be safe for cruise ships to resume sailing”.

Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival’s ships, which saw major outbreaks on the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess.

Carnival Cruise Line said it was “committed to supporting all public health efforts to manage the Covid-19 situation” in the statement to customers and travel agents announcing a limited resumption of its North America operations.

“We are taking a measured approach, focusing our return to service on a select number of homeports where we have more significant operations that are easily accessible by car for the majority of our guests,” it continued.

The CDC no-sail order was first issued on 14 March amid rising concerns about how “cruise ship travel may continue to introduce, transmit, or spread Covid-19”. The order was extended for 100 days on 15 April until 24 July, prohibiting travel until Covid-19 is no longer a public health emergency or the CDC modifies the order based on specific public health advice.

Alongside the announcement to resume operations, Carnival Cruise Line said it had cancelled all of its trips in July and extended the “pause” operations in all other North American and Australian markets until the end of August.

“We will use this additional time to continue to engage experts, government officials and stakeholders on additional protocols and procedures to protect the health and safety of our guests, crew and the communities we serve,” the statement continued.

In a statement, the CDC said it “is closely monitoring the situation on cruise ships while we review the cruise lines’ plans to prevent, detect, contain and respond to Covid-19 during the no-sail period.

“CDC will continue to work with cruise lines to ensure all necessary public health procedures are in place when cruise lines do begin regular sailing.

The largest trade association for the cruise industry has called the CDC’s requirements for disembarkation “impractical”.

The standoff comes amid a deteriorating situation on many ships around the world and a rising death toll of crew members.

More than 100,000 crew workers are still trapped on cruise ships globally, at least 50 of which have Covid-19 infections. This number includes around 80,000 crew members on 120 ships that are in international waters near the US waiting to disembark.

Revealed: 100,000 crew never made it off cruise ships amid coronavirus crisis Read more

Some major cruise operators have blamed the CDC for not allowing trapped crew to leave ships. But the health agency said it “stand[s] ready to approve these requests with same-day turnaround in most cases”, and has urged staff to contact cruise liners about disembarkation.

The CDC confirmed it had detected hundreds of Covid-19 and Covid-like illness cases in crew since March in US waters, resulting in the deaths of at least six crew.

A doctor on the Norwegian Gem, operated by Norwegian Cruise Line, died aboard the ship from a “respiratory illness” on Thursday.

The Miami Herald obtained internal Norwegian Cruise Line documents confirming the doctor’s death and assuring crew on the ship that he had died in his sleep from “cardio-respiratory arrest”, but had “no symptoms of Covid-19”. The Herald reported that the cruise company did not respond to their inquiries. Norwegian Cruise Line also did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.

A third crew member on the Oasis of the Seas, currently off the coast of Florida, died in hospital on Sunday. The death of Carlos Baluran, who worked the night shift in the vessel’s incinerator, comes after the death of waiter Dexter Joyosa and Indonesian waiter Iputu Sugiartha in the last two weeks on the same ship.

In a statement, the CDC told the Guardian that it is “allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in US waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members”.

It said: “These requirements include ensuring safe transportation by non-commercial means, providing cloth face coverings to crew members or ensuring they have their own, and providing instructions to crew members to stay home for 14 days after they reach their destination.

“CDC shared this information with all cruise lines in US waters on 23 April 2020 to help crew members return home safely. Since then, CDC has received and approved signed attestations to disembark crew from 15 ships.

“Some cruise lines have been unwilling to comply with the requirements to safely disembark their crew. Reasons include unwillingness to sign the attestation because of the legal consequences, and not wanting to pay for noncommercial transportation.”

But Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the largest trade association for the cruise industry, said some of the CDC’s requirements were “impractical”.

“To require employers to guarantee that every employee outside the workplace will fulfil all of the CDC’s stated requirements, including not having any interaction with the public whatsoever, with criminal sanctions at stake, is both unprecedented and impractical,” it said in a statement.

On Monday, the first wrongful death lawsuit for a crew member was filed on behalf of the family of an Indonesian housekeeper on the Symphony of the Seas, operated by Royal Caribbean. The suit alleges that the company failed to protect staff by not implementing social distancing measures on board by allowing crew to hold parties and eat together.

The company replied in a statement that it was working with authorities around the world to repatriate thousands of staff. It confirmed it had agreed to CDC restrictions to repatriate staff, and said it declined to comment on pending litigation.

Asked what support it was providing crew in the wake of the three deaths on the Oasis of the Seas, it said: “We have our Employee Assistance Program that crew can call 24 hours a day and is confidential.”

Carnival Cruise Line, which announced plans to restart operations at the beginning of August, said it would use 18 ships to repatriate more than 10,000 healthy crew members to Asia, Africa, Europe, India and Latin America.

“The safety and wellbeing of our team members continues to be a top priority. Given the pause in our operations, we are committed to getting our crew members safely home to their families. We sincerely thank them for their hard work, patience and understanding during this process,” said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line.

Alongside more than 100,000 crew, CLIA confirmed that 50 passengers remain at sea on five cruise ships – Celebrity Eclipse, Costa Deliziosa, Queen Mary 2, Caribbean Princess and Coral Princess – as of 29 April. So far, CLIA has recorded 2,789 confirmed cases of Covid-19 onboard 33 CLIA oceangoing cruise ships, but could not provide data relating to crew.

“It’s a shame that it comes down to dollars and cents,” said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer in Miami, who has represented both the cruise companies and, most recently, cruise crew members.

Q&A What are flags of convenience? Show Hide A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.

For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes. For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers' Federation. Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account. The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition. Karen McVeigh, senior reporter

He said the situation facing crews now is rooted in the cruise industry’s avoidance of US governance. Even though the largest cruise lines are headquartered in the US and serve largely American clientele, they avoid US labour law and other regulation by registering outside the US and sailing their ships under foreign flags.

“These crew members are like refugees now. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place,” he said. “The cruise lines think they can do anything they want with these folks and not treat them like human beings and not get them back to their homes.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/cruise-companies-accused-of-refusing-to-let-stranded-crew-disembark-due-to-cost-coronavirus
['Rory Carroll'],2020-05-05,Ireland faces bill for millions to remove 'ghost ship' from rocks,"Salvage experts say owner of MV Alta, which ran aground in February, may never be found

The ghost ship that washed on to Ireland’s coast earlier this year remains something of a mystery: its owner has not been found, which could potentially leave the Irish state with a bill of millions for its removal.

Authorities are still trying to trace those who own and are responsible for the MV Alta, a 77-metre cargo vessel that ran aground near Ballycotton, a fishing village in County Cork overlooking the Celtic Sea, in February.

It had traversed the Atlantic for more than a year without crew or passengers and skirted the Americas, Africa and Europe before wedging itself on to rocks during Storm Dennis.

“We’re still trying to establish ownership and that process may take up to a year,” a spokesperson for Ireland’s revenue commissioners, who act as “receiver of wreck”, a statutory function, said on Tuesday.

An individual purporting to represent the owner contacted the agency in February but that ownership claim remains unproven. “We’re still investigating,” said the spokesman.

If no owner is found, the Irish state will face a choice: spend millions of euros removing the vessel or let the elements determine its fate.

The Alta caught the public’s imagination but locals bristle at the prospect of a rusting ruin remaining on their shores, a magnet for curious and in some cases reckless sightseers. Before Covid-19 restrictions there were reports of people boarding the vessel despite warnings that it was dangerous and unstable.

Salvage experts say the Alta has no commercial value and that the Irish state may never track down the owner.

“She’s too old and her scrap value would be low,” Mark Hoddinott, a salvage and wreck removal expert with Brand Marine, told RTE. “Whether the state would want to remove her just because she was an eyesore, I doubt. The cost of removing her would be quite considerable too – €5m-10m or I would say probably a bit higher. Is it really worth it? My own view would be probably not.”

Built in 1976, the Alta was flagged in Tanzania, changed owner in 2017 and was sailing from Greece to Haiti in September 2018 when it became disabled about 1,380 miles (2,220km) south-east of Bermuda.

China has successfully launched a new rocket and prototype spacecraft, according to state media, in a major test of its ambitions to operate a permanent space station and send astronauts to the Moon.

A Long March 5B rocket took off from the Wenchang launch site on the southern island of Hainan and eight minutes later an unmanned prototype spacecraft successfully separated and entered its planned orbit, Xinhua reported. A test version of a cargo return capsule also successfully separated from the rocket, Xinhua said.

China hopes that the craft will one day transport astronauts to a space station that it plans to complete by 2022 – and eventually to the Moon. It will have capacity for a crew of six.

The spacecraft and capsule were slated to return to a landing site by Friday after completing their test flights, said Ji Qiming of China’s manned space agency.

The United States is so far the only country to have sent humans to the Moon. But in its effort to catch up China has sent astronauts into space, satellites into orbit and a rover to the far side of the Moon in 2019.

The successful maiden flight of the 54-metre Long March 5B – which has a takeoff mass of about 849 tonnes – should reassure China, following failures of the 7A model in March and 3B model in April. Beijing has launched several spacecraft since 1999 and its previous vessel, the Shenzhou, was modelled after Russia’s Soyuz.

Assembly of the Tiangong space station, whose name means Heavenly Palace, is expected to begin this year and finish in 2022. It will have three modules, with living and working quarters and two annexes for scientific experiments.

China plans to send an astronaut to the Moon in about a decade and then build a base there. Its lunar rover on the far side has driven about 450 metres so far.

['Emily Holden'],2020-05-05,"Gas stoves making indoor air up to five times dirtier than outdoor air, report finds","Gas stoves are making people sick, contributing pollution that makes indoor air up to two to five times dirtier than outdoor air, according to a new report.

Despite the risks, regulators have failed to set standards for indoor air quality – a problem that is now likely to be exacerbated by large numbers of people spending time inside and cooking at home during the coronavirus pandemic.

Fossil-fuel-burning stoves are likely exposing tens of millions of Americans to air pollution levels that would be illegal if they were outside, concludes the review of decades of science by the Rocky Mountain Institute and multiple environmental advocacy groups.

Lead report author Brady Seals said little attention has been paid despite longstanding knowledge of the problem. “Somehow we’ve gotten accustomed to having a combustion device, often unvented, inside of the home,” Seals said.

About a third of US households cook primarily with gas – which emits nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide, in addition to the particle pollution that all types of stoves produce. Older, poorly maintained stoves pollute even more including risks from carbon monoxide.

Even small increases in short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide can increase asthma risks for children. One analysis found that children in homes with gas stoves have a 42% higher chance of having asthma symptoms. Another in Australia attributed 12.3% of all childhood asthma burden to gas stoves.

Nitrogen dioxide also makes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease worse and may be linked to heart problems, diabetes and cancer.

Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause a headache, nausea, a rapid heartbeat, cardiac arrest and death.

The best solution, according to the report, is to change to electric stoves. But individuals with gas stoves can also open windows, cook on their back burners, use an exhaust hood, run an air purifier with a HEPA filter and install a carbon monoxide detector.

Indoor air pollution hits poor Americans and people of color worse because they are often also exposed to lead, mercury, highways and industrial plants, said Dr Robert Gould, a California pathologist and board member for Physicians for Social Responsibility who peer-reviewed the report.

“We just need to make these investments,” Gould said. “This fits into an overall plan we would have to protect, particularly, our vulnerable populations.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/gas-stoves-air-pollution-environment
['Joe Parkin Daniels'],2020-05-05,Donald Trump denies link to Venezuela armed raid by US citizens,"Donald Trump has denied any involvement by the US government in what Venezuelan officials have called a failed armed incursion in the South American country that led to the capture of two American “mercenaries”.

The president made the comment to reporters at the White House after Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, announced that authorities there had detained two US citizens working with a US military veteran who has claimed responsibility for the foiled operation.

“We’ll find out. We just heard about it,” Trump said when asked about the incident and the Americans’ arrests. “But it has nothing to do with our government.”

In a televised address, Maduro said authorities arrested 13 “terrorists” on Monday involved in what he described as a plot coordinated with Washington to enter the country via the Caribbean coast and oust him.

Eight people were killed during the incursion attempt on Sunday, Venezuelan authorities said.

Maduro showed what he said were the US passports and other identification cards belonging to Airan Berry and Luke Denman, whom he said were in custody and had been working with Jordan Goudreau, an American military veteran who leads a Florida-based security company called Silvercorp USA.

The two detained Americans, former special operations forces members who had served with Goudreau, were believed to be in the custody of Venezuelan military intelligence, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Washington has waged a campaign of economic sanctions and diplomatic measures against Venezuela in an effort to oust Maduro, accusing him of having rigged elections in 2018.

But while Trump has repeatedly said all options are on the table, his administration has shown no apparent interest in military action as it pursues what it calls a “maximum pressure” strategy against Maduro.

Maduro’s government, however, says the United States wants to control the Opec member nation’s massive oil reserves.

Since early 2019, the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim president.

But Maduro remains in power, backed by the military as well as Russia, Cuba and China, which some US officials say privately is a source of frustration for Trump.

Guaidó insisted that Maduro was seeking to distract from other problems in recent days, including a deadly prison riot and a violent days-long gang battle in Caracas, the capital.

Adding to the chaos, a blackout swept through parts of the country on Tuesday afternoon, leaving areas in 17 of the country’s 23 states without electricity.

NetBlocks, an internet observatory, reported that national connectivity was down to about 60% of ordinary levels. Widespread power outages – increasingly a mainstay of Venezuelan life – have been attributed to years of corrupt mismanagement of the energy sector.

David Smilde, a Venezuela analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, said he suspected that while the planned incursion into the country was probably the work of freelancing mercenaries, their plan may have been motivated by misguided and cavalier US policy.

US indicts Nicolás Maduro and other top Venezuelan leaders for drug trafficking Read more

“Put a $15m reward on Nicolás Maduro like we are in the wild west and you can pretty much count on some people acting like cowboys,” said Smilde in reference to indictments leveled at Maduro and his cronies.

“In the end this has strengthened the Maduro government in its efforts to look invincible, and has undermined the Guaidó government’s efforts to look legitimate and competent,” said Smilde.

Mike Vigil, the former head of international operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said to the AP: “It shocks me how insane they were. They walked right into a coiled rattlesnake without even having minimally studied the capacity of the Venezuelan armed forces.”

Vanessa Neumann, Guaidó’s envoy to the UK, denied any links with the failed incursion, but raised fears for the captured Americans.

“It is deeply unfortunate that they will become bargaining chips for the Maduro regime,” the diplomat said. “And that they will suffer the same awful conditions that Venezuelan prisoners also face, in crumbling jails with no healthcare during a pandemic,” Neumann said.

['Fiona Harvey'],2020-05-05,Greta Thunberg and children's group hit back at attempt to throw out climate case,"Greta Thunberg and a group of other children have pushed forward their legal complaint at the UN against countries they accuse of endangering children’s wellbeing through the climate crisis, despite attempts to have it thrown out.

The 16 children, including the Swedish environmental activist, lodged a legal case with the UN committee on the rights of the child against Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey last September.

They alleged that the countries – which are legally obliged to protect children under the UN convention on the rights of the child – breached those obligations by failing to protect them from the “direct, imminent and foreseeable risk to their health and wellbeing” posed by the climate crisis.

Three countries – Brazil, France and Germany – have replied to the petition, saying it should not be admissible by the committee.

But on Tuesday the children hit back, arguing that the countries should be judged by their behaviour on the climate crisis. They said the three countries were all failing to cut their emissions in line with the Paris agreement.

In response to the objections raised by Brazil, France and Germany, the children said they had been “directly and foreseeably injured” by the greenhouse gas emissions that those governments had allowed to change the climate.

They have submitted new scientific research on how the countries are failing in their obligations, and said it would be “futile” to argue their case in separate domestic lawsuits in each country, as that “would not provide the type of far-reaching international relief needed to reverse climate change”.

Although 140 countries, excluding the US, have ratified the UN convention on the rights of the child, only 46 governments have adopted a protocol that allows for this kind of legal action. Of those, the five biggest greenhouse gas emitters – Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey – are targeted in the lawsuit, which has been brought by the children with the backing of the green campaigning group Earthjustice and the international law firm Hausfeld.

There has been no decision yet from the UN committee on whether to hear the legal complaint.

The lawsuit joins a growing number of attempts to bring climate cases to court, alleging that government or businesses have flouted the law or failed in their international obligations. One of the most successful has been in the Netherlands, in the Urgenda case, in which judges found the government must change its policies to tackle emissions and the climate crisis.

In the UK, campaigners brought a successful legal challenge that found the government was wrong to allow the expansion of Heathrow airport without taking into account its obligations under the Paris agreement. The ruling will have implications for other government plans likely to raise emissions, such as road-building schemes.

More than 1,300 legal actions have been brought around the world to try to force governments to confront the climate crisis. More than 1,000 are in the US; the highest profile case there, the Juliana case, was dismissed by judges earlier this year. There are similar cases ongoing in 28 countries including Ireland, Australia, Spain and New Zealand.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/greta-thunberg-and-childrens-group-hit-back-at-attempt-to-throw-out-climate-case
['Michael Safi'],2020-05-05,"Iran's state broadcaster meddled in Scottish referendum, says Facebook","Iran’s state broadcaster experimented with using fake social media accounts to influence the outcome of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and other western elections, according to a report from Facebook released on Tuesday.

The Iranian network, one of eight to be suspended for so-called “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” by the social media giant in April, points to efforts by state-linked groups to try to use Facebook to influence foreign democratic contests years before Russia’s alleged campaign against the 2016 US presidential contest.

The network was linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting Corporation and involved more than 500 accounts that claimed to be independent but amplified narratives favourable to Tehran, according to Graphika, a social network analysis company that was allowed to independently verify Facebook’s findings.

The pages and accounts involved dated back to 2011 and targeted audiences in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. Some had thousands of followers and operated for years while others were quickly deleted without drawing much engagement.

The network’s targets briefly included the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, about which a handful of accounts posted pro-leave content including several cartoons portraying then prime minister David Cameron as “the embodiment of English oppression”, the Graphika report said.

The network also promoted the 2012 US presidential bid by libertarian candidate Ron Paul and the anti-capitalist Occupy movement, but the efforts in all three cases were brief and made little impact.

“The focus on western democratic exercises appears to have been a short-lived experiment conducted with a relatively small number of accounts: it did not have the scale, the sophistication, or the duration of the later Russian efforts,” it said.

Its more sustained campaigns were in Arabic. It published memes and linked to articles that were critical of Iran’s geopolitical foes, especially Israel and Saudi Arabia. More recent content mentioned coronavirus, framing the pandemic as an attack on Iran by a foreign enemy and a reason to lift sanctions on both Iran and Syria.

The influence network was notable less for its success than for its start date, Graphika said, showing that state attempts to meddle in democratic elections were underway years before they became prominent with the efforts of Russian-linked groups to sow division and promote Donald Trump.

['Tim Jonze'],2020-05-05,Is Jenny from the block or the yacht? The poll taking the temperature of our times,"Locked down in Milan, the artist Francesco Vezzoli has decided to survey the world’s emotional state under coronavirus – with a little help from art history, pop culture and Prada

“I haven’t seen a human being for 65 days,” says Italian artist Francesco Vezzoli from his home in lockdown Milan. “I think I’m developing a very tiny bit of agoraphobia.”

As an artist whose work so often involves people gathering for grand social occasions – among other things he’s convinced Gore Vidal and Helen Mirren to create a trailer for an imaginary remake of Caligula and persuaded Kate Moss to DJ at a 24-hour exhibition in Paris – quarantine does not come naturally for Vezzoli. It doesn’t help that he’s originally from Brescia in the north of Italy – “one of the biggest red dots in Europe” as he puts it.

“It’s been incredibly intense,” he admits. “I found myself going online at three in the morning, to check the local newspapers to see if there were people I knew among the dead. When you’re living alone the news can get in your head. So you calling me right now is the perfect excuse to change the channel!”

Luckily for Vezzoli, fashion house Prada also came calling recently with a welcome distraction. They’ve commissioned him to make Love Stories: A Sentimental Survey by Francesco Vezzoli, a fun (if entirely unscientific) way of taking a snapshot of the Italian mood during this emotionally fragile time. “It has been the biggest gift of my life,” laughs Vezzoli. “They’ve managed to take my brain away [from the pandemic].”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cultural barometer ... from Love Stories – A Sentimental Survey by Francesco Vezzoli. Photograph: Francesco Vezzoli/Courtesy Fondazione Prada

The project was commissioned with lockdown in mind, but Vezzoli says he’s long dreamed of hiring one of the big polling companies to survey his nation’s emotional state. Instead of a pollster, though, he’ll be using the poll function on Instagram Stories – each weekday from 11 May an image of a famous couple will appear and viewers will be able to vote for one of two pithy phrases written by Vezzoli. For example, a photograph of Miss Piggy and Kermit will offer the audience the choice between “non-binary couple” and “a love supreme”; an image of James Dean and Marlon Brando gives you the options “Slave & Master” or “Hair & Make Up”. It’s not all pop culture – some couples are taken from paintings by Caravaggio or Toulouse-Lautrec.

“And there’s one picture of Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret,” says Vezzoli. “They’re both looking at something that we don’t see in such a different way. Under the Queen the word says ‘finding’ and under her sister I put ‘looking’.”

The project is, he says, about the complexity of relationships, as well as acting as a cultural barometer: “It will be interesting to measure how many people react to each image – have they forgotten certain icons that maybe in the art world we think are totally recognisable but are no longer relevant to a younger generation?”

Each week’s results will be posted on Saturdays, and on Sunday Vezzoli has invited an array of cultural critics, historians and artists to comment on them, from Klaus Biesenbach, the director of Moca in Los Angeles, to “the most important ancient art historian in Italy” Salvatore Settis. I wonder how these critics will be expected to make sense of the poll’s results, given they seem rather open to interpretation – but that, Vezzoli says, is the whole point. “I have no idea what will happen!” he laughs. “The beauty of the project is that these people have total freedom to make their own interpretation of other people’s interpretations. Everything is up for critical grabs. It’s all a big collaborative game, a distraction … just a lot of fun to be honest.”

Vezzoli’s work often seems “just a lot of fun”. It can be flashy, gleefully shallow, a little daft – but dig deeper and it contains political undertones. In 2009 he filmed Natalie Portman and Michelle Williams wrestling over a perfume bottle in an advert for a fake fragrance called Greed – all quite silly, yet clearly a satire on the Berlusconi era too.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Greed – video by Francesco Vezzoli

This work is no different, says Vezzoli. “There’s an image of Ronald Reagan dancing with Imelda Marcos where they’re both dressed in white satin,” he says. “So of course if you figure out who they are you start asking – why is the president of the United States dancing with the wife of a dictator? Did this really happen? So I think most of the questions are political, even if it’s just asking if Jenny is from the block or the yacht.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘It’s all a big collaborative game’ ... from Love Stories – A Sentimental Survey. Photograph: Francesco Vezzoli/Courtesy Fondazione Prada

What Vezzoli seems most proud about with Love Stories is the fact that it’s a genuinely digital artwork. “You’re seeing galleries trying to digitise themselves in this moment … but being digital doesn’t mean a drone with a camera flying around your institution! Online viewing rooms are just analogue ways of thinking put online. With Love Stories, I don’t say if it’s a good exhibition or a bad one, but it’s a real digital exhibition.”

It’s tempting to think that such projects will become commonplace as coronavirus changes the art landscape, but Vezzoli advises caution with any bold predictions: “After the Lehman Brothers crash there was a naive hope that it might bring a higher degree of morality into the art world,” he says. “Instead we saw the opposite – the rich in the art world got richer, the rest got wiped away. When this is over people may end up bingeing on comfort food rather than nouvelle cuisine. But then hopefully, after that, there will be an explosion of something completely new.

“The world has seen tragedies like this before but never within a hyper-technological environment,” he continues. “We have no idea how this will impact on our brains. I haven’t left my apartment for so long that it has generated in me new emotions that I’ve never dealt with before. It’s unfathomable. I just hope that gentleness will be one of the feelings people respond with.”

And will this project at least give the isolated Vezzoli a greater sense of human contact?

“Oh yeah!” he exclaims. “Even just this interview is making me feel more human, more alive again! It’s been very healthy for my brain and for my heart.”",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/05/is-jenny-from-the-block-or-the-yacht-the-poll-taking-the-temperature-of-our-times

The shutdown feels like a good opportunity to examine an age-old feminist question: when women put makeup on, can they ever truly be doing it for themselves?

We will probably never have an answer. The pressure imposed on women to look good is such a part of our existence that we might never get rid of it – even “dressing up for oneself” can be traced back to self-hatred fueled by a beauty-obsessed culture.

But the shutdown means that we interact less with the outside world and the societal pressures that come with it. We asked women about their own relationship to their appearance right now. Are some wearing a full face of makeup every day? Wearing a bra? And who still dresses up, anyway? Here are their answers.

Dina Gachman, Texas

Before everything shut down in Austin, I would put on mascara and lipstick (Clinique Chunky Cherry) every day, even though I work from home as a writer. My southern belle mom always taught us to “put on a little lipstick” no matter what – advice I hated as a teen. Somewhere along the way, I figured she was right. I still put on mascara and lipstick in quarantine, even though I know it’s ridiculous. It makes me feel human. It brings some normalcy to a very abnormal and scary time and It lifts my mood, even if I’m just walking to the mailbox.

Sarah Skiles, Los Angeles

I grew a unibrow, named it Angelina: Conquerer of Space and Time. I wanted to see what it would look like since I’ve done upkeep since I was 14. I was disappointed by the results, which in no way made me resemble Frida Kahlo. Sparse. Too many years of plucking.

Sarah Wilson, Leeds

I feel much happier with my natural appearance after a month in lockdown. I’ve worn makeup pretty much every day since I was about 14, even though in recent years I’ve cut down to just a bit of foundation and mascara. I believed I had an uneven and blotchy skin tone, but having now not worn a scrap of makeup for a month (probably the longest I’ve gone without it in nine years) I actually like the way my skin looks. I feel like I’m going to have the confidence to just stop wearing makeup once this is all over.

Niamh Ronan, London

I’ve spent even more time scrutinising and hating my appearance in lockdown. I’m still doing my makeup almost every day and trying to make myself look presentable because I can’t be [bothered] to get upset by my reflection. I am still tinting my eyebrows, doing a full skincare routine, tonight I think I will fake tan. It is kind of depressing. I really wanted this to be the time where I’d get slightly comfortable in my own skin, but actually I can’t. Especially not now – it’s too much work to unravel years of self-hatred during a crisis.

Ariadne Braso, Philadelphia

Since shutdown, I’m not wearing whole parts of my wardrobe, getting haircuts or getting my hair colored. The only makeup I really wear is eyeliner and i still put that on when I’m going outside.

It’s not about confidence, it’s much more about the way I see myself Ariadne Braso

As a trans person – I haven’t gotten the whole laser hair removal on my face yet, so I still shave my face and I have found myself not shaving, not consciously, but if i don’t go out I don’t do it. Trans-femme people can get really stressed out about body hair, but I’m fortunate to have very thin facial hair and body hair so I don’t notice it too much.

Now when I look in the mirror I feel more stripped down. It’s not about confidence, it’s much more about the way I see myself. I see myself as very colorful and vibrant and so that’s why I dress up the way I do. Right now it feels like some of the functions through which I normally express myself are disabled. In the past i have thought of myself as pretty vain but now I realize it’s not about being vain, it’s about not getting to express myself, and feeling like parts of myself are stifled.

Danielle Emina, London

I honestly don’t know how I’m going to go back to wearing a bra after this?

Frances Forbes-Carbines, London

I am 30 and rather overweight. Favorite dresses no longer zip up the back, and as all the shops are closed I’m having to order dresses online, without of course trying them on first. I’m eating somewhat wantonly: takeaways, large portions of meat and veg too. My face is unusually spotty. A couple of massive subcutaneous beasts lurk on my cheeks of all places, never rising to the surface. I put expensive green highlighter on them to make them less apparent, but now it looks like I have marker pen on my face. I doll myself up daily, thinking I want to look nice to walk my little dog. My leg hair grows and I shave it occasionally so I can wear my dresses.

All in all I am discontented with my appearance in lockdown. I find all body types beautiful but I feel heavy and like my excess weight is tiring me out. I post maudlinly on social media about my excess weight and receive no likes. The lack of face-to-face contact with friends makes me blue, as well as lack of opportunities to go on dates and have occasions to dress up for.

Allison Alexy, Michigan

I think all I’ve learned is that lighting matters more than anything else? Oh wait, and also that my hair is so flat it looks drawn on with a pencil. Two lessons! Someone said that what we realize now is that the best part of going out to dinner with your friends is that you don’t have to look at your own face for that whole time. And it’s true – I have been recording my lectures and it is humbling, man. To watch myself on a video is the worst.

Elisabeth Gampel, Munich

Since the lockdown, I love to wear no makeup. It is the first time I feel beautiful without it. I also wear sneakers (I normally do not like them because it reminds me of my childhood in a poor, working-class family), and I do not miss business clothes. And I do not want to wear a bra again.

Sara Sloves, New York

I don’t have the same morning routine anymore and I am mostly wearing sports clothes. When I do take a shower, if I know I’m going to go running, I’ll put on sunscreen and a little bit of makeup – mascara and a little bit of eyeshadow. It makes me feel more awake and I feel like it’s nice for other people to see something nice. I am having a little fun with it – wearing mismatching or stripy tights or something a little festive when I run, because life is a bummer right now. We can’t control it, so trying to control what you can control helps a little bit.

Afia Chaudhury, London

You’d think quarantine would see to me not taking care of my appearance and elucidate that this dressing up is for others. But it’s proved that I do it for moi. I love looking/feeling buff. And as a Muslim when you pray you’re supposed to look your best, so may as well stunt to the heavens.

The Oscar-winning actor was photographed just before lockdown for the magazine’s June issue, but the accompanying interview explores her experiences self-isolating at home in Surrey.

“I am sure I feel like everyone else, such unprecedented times are quite hard to comprehend,” she says. “What is a good thing is that it has made people aware of the predicament of others who are completely alone. If a great deal of kindness comes out of this, then that will be a plus.”

Dench has become an unlikely social media star during the Covid-19 crisis, appearing in videos posted by family members, despite not using social media personally.

Last month her daughter, Finty Williams, posted a Twitter video of Dench, wearing a novelty dog hat with pop up ears, saying: “Just keep laughing. That’s all we can do”. It has now been watched 5.4 million times.

Earlier this month Dench and her grandson Sam Williams did a TikTok dance to the song Cheryl by the US rapper Yung Gravy. The same week a video of her washing her hands with Gyles Brandreth while reciting ‘The Owl and the Pussy-cat’ went viral.

Joining another couple for erotic fun is not uncommon; many people enjoy it. In fact, there are many communities of people who regularly participate in this sexual style. But it is not for everyone, and jealousies and insecurities can arise no matter how sexually open a person is. “Swinging” is advanced sexual play that requires a couple to be well bonded and requires each partner to be psychologically stable as well as sexually mature.

Encrypted emails and documents are protected by both encryption keys and passwords. The bad guys would need to know both to read your stuff.

If you plan to write an email to a Guardian journalist about a sensitive matter, look into PGP encryption. Used properly, PGP should make a message or document unreadable to anyone except the person who sent it and the person for whom it was encrypted. You will use a public key that belongs to the person you are writing to, but is freely available on the internet. This key turns your message into an unreadable jumble. Your recipient – and no one else – has a corresponding private key which can unlock messages that were encrypted by their public key.

Get started

Don’t use your regular email address. Create a new email account solely for corresponding with the Guardian. Do it on a computer that isn’t being monitored, and make sure the sign-up information you provide doesn’t tie the account back to you.

If you’re using a browser-based service such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail or GMX webmail, look into Mailvelope for encrypting messages in your browser. Two popular applications for encrypting text and documents, which you can then paste or attach to emails, are Gpg4win for Windows and GPGSuite for Mac.

Once you have installed one of these tools you can use it to create your own PGP keys. Keep your private key and password safe and don’t store the two together.

After that

You should encrypt your messages and attachments using both your public key and that of the person you are writing to. All being well, this means that only you and the journalist will be able to decrypt them. You can find Guardian journalists’ keys at theguardian.com/pgp.

The Trump administration is poised to break up the White House coronavirus taskforce, the public face of the US response to the virus, even as experts warn that the worst is yet to come. Here is what we know so far about the taskforce and where the US stands in its response to Covid-19.

What is the coronavirus taskforce?

Days after public health officials announced the first confirmed case of Covid-19 on US soil on 21 January, the White House announced that it had formed a taskforce that would lead the federal government’s response to the pandemic. The group, it said, would work together to monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus in the US and keep the public informed about important public health and travel guidance.

By March, as the US reported thousands of new cases of Covid-19 every day, the taskforce gave daily press briefings, ostensibly to update Americans about the public health emergency.

But at the end of April, the briefings stopped. The last press conference was held on 24 April. According to reports, Trump’s advisers said his daily appearances were hurting his chance of re-election in November, especially after he suggested – with no evidence – that disinfectant could fight the virus in human bodies.

Why is the White House ending the coronavirus taskforce?

Pence insisted that “it really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country”, despite data on the continuing public health risk.

Recently there has been some tension in messaging about the virus from key members of the group.

Fauci has cautioned that the US needs to have enough testing capacity to reopen safely, and is not yet at that stage. Fauci said the US will need to double its current level of testing within several weeks.

“I don’t think there’s a chance that this virus is just going to disappear,” he told National Geographic. “It’s going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge.”

But acknowledging that the US is still behind on testing does not chime with Trump’s messaging.

In recent days, Trump has started to amp up talk about reopening the economy, saying Tuesday morning that it was “going to happen pretty fast”.",theguardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/05/coronavirus-us-live-fauci-warns-against-rush-reopen-trump-cuomo-latest-news-updates

Utah state troopers pulled over a five-year-old boy driving his parents’ car down the highway. The precocious youngster told the officers he was on his way to California to buy himself a Lamborghini – with $3 in his pocket.

Troopers in Ogden, outside Salt Lake City, initially thought the car was being driven by an impaired driver. But when they found the boy driving, he told police he left home after an argument, in which his mother refused to buy him the luxury sports car.

Utah Highway Patrol (@UTHighwayPatrol) One of our Troopers in Weber Co. initiated a traffic stop on what he thought was an impaired driver. Turns out it was this young man, age 5, somehow made his way up onto the freeway in his parents' car.

“He decided he’d take the car and go to California to buy one himself,” police said on Twitter. “He might have been short on the purchase amount, as he only had $3 in his wallet.”

The young lad could barely see over the steering wheel. The authorities have not named the family and the police tweeted a picture of him in the driver’s seat, but with his face blocked out.

[],2020-01-10,Exude Confidence in Your Dating Profile,"With January round the corner, we’re about to enter peak busy time for online dating. The quickest way to up your dating profile game is to get yourself some new profile pictures that showcase you at your best… but sometimes that is easier said than done.

We spoke to the UK dating photography expert, Saskia Nelson about how you can exude confidence in your dating profile photos.

Get comfortable in front of the lens

OK, this may sound a bit like hard work but it really works. Before you head off on your photoshoot, spend a little time in front of the mirror and practice some different looks and get a feel for what you’re doing with your mouth, chin etc when you like yourself the most in the shot. Then experiment taking some selfies – don’t worry, you can delete them straight afterwards, but it is a quick and easy first step to getting comfortable in front of the lens.

Confident people take up room

Remember a time when you were on fire

This always helps me. Think back to a time when you were absolutely on fire; it might be that time you delivered the presentation of your life or you stunned an audience with your knockout version of Killing Me Softly. Now remember how you felt about yourself. Amazing wasn’t it? If you can access that feeling and channel it in front of the camera, you’ll just shine in your profile photos. It takes a little practice but it is hugely effective once you’ve got the hang of it.

Ground yourself

Grounding techniques are designed to redistribute the energy from your head or mind into your body and doing so has an almost instant calming effect. We want calm confidence in your profile photos (rather than arrogant confidence). I love using grounding techniques before I have to do anything that makes me feel nervous, it immediately relaxes me and feelings of confidence usually follow.

There are different ways to ground yourself and some are super quick and effective. I like to breathe in and visualise my breath moving through me starting at my feet and moving all the way up my body to my head and back down again. Sometimes just a hand on top of your head for 30 seconds is very grounding. You need to try it to believe it.

Own the space

Wear that hot first date outfit

Once you’re channelling the right mindset, you need the outfits to match. The easiest way to do this is to wear something that you’d usually choose for a hot first date. You know the outfit, the one that curves in all the right places and makes heads turn. That outfit is the one that is going to help build on your new-found confidence.

Take up space

Mastering your body language is the quickest way to come across as confident, even if you’re really struggling to feel it. Don’t be afraid to take up room. Confident people take up room. They’re not shrinking themselves to fit in. The easiest way to do this is to use open body language, not closed. Don’t ‘cross anything’, like arms or legs. Crossed arms, in particular, come across as defensive at best, aggressive at worst. Open arms and hands come across as warm and welcoming. Don’t shrink away from the lens, open yourself up to it. Own the space.

Hold something

A really quick and easy way to feel confident is to grab hold of something. It’s human nature to wonder what to do with your hands when you’re having your photo taken so holding something immediately relaxes you. Even better, hold something that tells people a bit more about who you are. That might be a camera, a favourite book, a notebook and pen, a yoga mat, a bike, even your dog (if they’re well behaved).

Have fun

If all else fails just aim to connect with your photographer (if they’re good, they’ll make this really easy to do) and make the decision to relax and enjoy their company. Experiment, go with the flow, have fun. Sit, stand, turn, dance, have a laugh and your photographer is bound to get some great natural shots. Fake smiles don’t reach your eyes so the best way to get genuinely happy, laughing shots is to just go for it and have a good time.",theguardian,https://soulmates.theguardian.com/blog/advice/how-to-exude-confidence-in-your-dating-profile-photos

"['Daniel Oberhaus', 'Daniel Oberhau', 'Sarah Scoles']",,Does It Matter That the DOD Released Those UFO Videos?,"On Monday, the US Department of Defense officially released three videos depicting encounters between Navy pilots and unidentified aerial phenomena. These events occurred in 2004 and 2015, but the videos didn’t publicly surface until The New York Times included them with a front-page story about the Pentagon’s “mysterious UFO program” in 2017. The Navy previously acknowledged that the videos are authentic, but the Pentagon never authorized them for release. Now it has.

The WIRED Guide to Aliens Everything you need to know about SETI, the Drake equation, ’Oumuamua, and hot tubs.

Each of the three videos contains footage captured by Navy pilots that show a strange-looking oval zipping through the air and over the ocean. In a video from 2015 called “Gimbal,” a flying object shaped like a Tic Tac whips through the clouds before it slows and begins to rotate. The pilot filming the encounter describes it over the radio as “a fucking drone, bro.” In another video from 2015, referred to as “Go Fast,” a small white speck is tracked by a jet’s infrared system as it flies low over the ocean. The oldest video, “FLIR1,” is also from a jet infrared system and shows an oval object rapidly accelerating.

The videos were originally published by The New York Times and To the Stars Academy of Arts and Sciences, a company founded by former Blink-182 frontman Tom DeLonge to research UFOs and other unexplained phenomena. When the videos were released in 2017, To the Stars staffers claimed that the footage had “been through the official declassification review process and has been approved for public release.”

Video: U.S. Department of Defense

“All videos were previously reviewed by the cognizant DOD authority under the 1910 process and were cleared for ‘unrestricted release’ by the Defense Office of Prepublication Security Review,” says Luis Elizondo, To the Stars’ director of government programs and services. Elizondo is a former Department of Defense employee who claims to have led its Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, the “mysterious UFO program” alluded to in the Times report. The “1910 process” refers to the Defense Department form 1910 used to request clearance to release DOD information to the public.

But in their statement this week, Pentagon officials describe the 2017 release as “unauthorized.” Three years later, the DOD is finally ready to authorize the videos … even though they’ve already been watched by millions of people. “After a thorough review, the department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena,” Department of Defense officials wrote in a press release published on Monday.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/does-it-matter-that-the-dod-released-those-ufo-videos#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Paris Martineau', 'Paris Martinea']",,"Which States Are Reopening, Which Remain on Lockdown, and Why","In the absence of clear federal oversight, state and local officials have led public health responses to the novel coronavirus. Over the past two months, officials across the nation have shuttered bars and restaurants, imposed curfews, and prohibited large gatherings in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, which has infected more than a million Americans and killed more than 64,000. By April 1, all but five states had issued statewide or local shelter in place orders to protect public health.

Now some officials are allowing businesses to reopen, citing concerns about the economic impacts of the shutdown, while others extend restrictions. The decentralized approach has led to a lack of consistency, breeding confusion among residents and small business owners. In Georgia and Oklahoma, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors can reopen under new state guidelines, but in Texas and Iowa—where officials have permitted restaurants and retailers to resume operations—they must remain closed.

This guide will be updated as new restrictions are imposed or lifted. Last Update: May 1, 2020, 5:30 pm.

Alabama

Governor Kay Ivey ordered all Alabama residents to shelter in place beginning April 4, after repeatedly insisting such an action was not necessary. It did not last long. Ivey later signed an executive order allowing all retail stores to reopen at 50 percent capacity starting April 30.

""We know that what we are announcing today will please some and make others frustrated that we're not going further at this time, but our job must be always to find the right balance,” Ivey said at a press conference on the reopening plans.

Alaska

Governor Mike Dunleavy relaxed his “Hunker Down” order for the state, which went into effect on March 28. Beginning April 24, restaurants, retail stores, person care services, gyms, law firms, and marketing offices were permitted to reopen, with restrictions. Restaurants and personal care services may serve customers in-house by reservation only, and strict social distancing and disinfection procedures must be in place.

Arizona

Governor Doug Ducey ordered all Arizona residents to shelter in place beginning March 31.

On April 29, Ducey announced he would extend the state's stay at home order to May 15, with some changes aimed at slowly reopening Arizona's economy. Retail stores will be permitted to reopen starting May 4, and can expand their operations on May 8, provided they follow strict state guidelines.

"['Medea Giordano', 'Medea Giordan', 'Jeffrey Van Cam']",,How to Make a CDC-Approved Cloth Face Mask,"The time has come to start covering your face. As we reported April 3, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends all citizens voluntarily wear a cloth face mask for essential trips out of the house to the grocery store, doctor, or other public places where the 6-foot social distancing rules may be difficult to maintain. In short, most places.

Wearing a cloth mask might help protect people around you, if you happen to be infected with Covid-19 but do not have symptoms yet. (These are Covid-19's typical symptoms.) Some individuals infected with Covid-19 never show symptoms or do not get very sick, especially if they are young. Basically, these masks mainly help others, not you—though if used properly, a cloth mask may help you avoid touching your face and infecting yourself while out of the house.

Be sure to frequently wash masks in the washing machine with regular detergent.

Updated April 23: We updated links, checked information in this article, and added a section on how to approach buying a mask, if you plan to do that.

Whether you are wearing a face covering or not, the CDC still recommends that you:

Wash your hands regularly. Use soap and water, and wash them for at least 20 seconds. Hand sanitizer is acceptable to use if you are unable to wash your hands.

Cover your face when coughing with a tissue or the inside of your elbow.

Avoid touching your face , because you could transmit the virus from your hands into your mouth.

Stay at home , except for essential trips outside like trips to the grocery store or to see your doctor. This is also called sheltering in place.

Practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from other people. The White House also recommends avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people, which should be easy because you're staying at home.

Clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces daily (here's our Covid-19 cleaning guide).

Some Mask Rules:

Do not buy and hoard medical masks . Health care professionals are already facing a devastating shortage in supplies, and we should not use protective masks that ill patients and health care workers may need.

Do not put a face mask on kids under 2 years old —or anyone who has difficulty breathing or might be unable to remove the mask themselves.

Do not remove a mask by its mouth area . Grab it by the straps. Wash your hands after touching it.

Do not just wear a standard bandana or scarf. Follow the instructions below to create a mask that has multiple layers and more tightly covers your face.

3 Ways to Make Your Own Face Covering

The CDC released directions for several DIY masks, as well as a short instructional video outlining its no-sew mask-making advice.

"['Condé Nast', 'Parker Hal']",,Google Pixel Buds (2020) Review: Better Than AirPods,"It’s taken Google a surprisingly long time to make good earbuds. The original Pixel Buds from 2018 were a bulky, mushroom-shaped mess that made you look like Frankenstein’s monster. The charging case was huge, the sound was middling, and when you finally worked up the courage to go outside with them, it felt like everyone wearing AirPods was laughing at you.

My expectations were muted last fall when Google announced a revamped pair with the same name—this time with no wire connecting the buds, just like offerings from Apple, Samsung, and Amazon. On specs alone, they're not remarkable. They’ve got five hours of battery life, which is short, especially compared to the 11 hours you get with Samsung's buds. They're also $179, making them $20 more than Apple's AirPods.

And yet, somehow, I’ve fallen in love with Google’s tiny, rounded earbuds. Especially as someone with an Android phone, I’d take these over nearly any wireless earbuds around.

Good Looks

Photograph: Google

The new Pixel Buds come with a case that's similar in size and design to the floss-like AirPods case, though Google's is a bit more rounded with a nice matte finish instead of Apple’s shiny plastic. I think it looks like a cute, little egg.

The buds no longer have a cable running between them, and they're tiny. How do they stay secure in your ears? Each bud has a long, elephant-like trunk that culminates in a cozy silicone eartip, with cute ear fins that protrude out of the top for increased stability. That means that when you wear them for the full five-hour charge time, you won't have the same annoying pain you might have after five hours of listening to the hard-tipped AirPods.

That comfort isn't just because of the silicone tips; these are some of the lightest buds around.

Exceptionally Usable

As much as I dislike the sound (and idiotic, eartip-less design) offered by AirPods, I understand why they’re the best-selling wireless headphones on the planet. By integrating its own special chips, Apple makes pairing, listening, and talking on the AirPods much easier than the competition.

In terms of setup and ease of use, the Pixel Buds are the closest to match it. When I popped open the lid of the case, they instantly paired to my Pixel 4, quickly setting themselves up for hands-free access to Google Assistant, much as AirPods do with Siri. (They'll pair this fast on most Android phones). You can tweak settings in the companion app, but you probably won’t need to download it. The Pixel Buds (like AirPods) will probably work exactly the way you want right out of the box.

Even the touch controls, located on the outside of each earbud, are well thought out. You can raise or lower volume by sliding your fingers left and right—so easy!—as well as play or pause music and change songs with various taps. Unlike other buds with touch controls, I never accidentally paused music when adjusting them in my ears, but I do love that they automatically pause when you pull 'em out.

Specs-wise, they leave me wanting more. I wish the battery lasted longer, though the case does net you an additional 19 hours. That’s AirPods-matching battery life, sure, but you can get earbuds that last longer for less than half the price.

It's nice to have wireless charging built in (you can also use a USB-C cable). Just don't try it on a vertical wireless charging stand, because the coils are often a bit too high up to reach it. They juice up best on a pad.

They boast an IPX4 rating unlike AirPods, so I don’t have to worry about taking them on long, sock-testing runs in wet weather conditions. And I prefer Google Assistant over Siri as well. It's better at answering questions, setting timers, sending emails and texts, and various other voice-based tasks.

Heck, I can even use Google Assistant’s real-time language-translation tool to understand what my partner (who insists I know more Spanish than I actually do) is saying in attempts to maintain fluency in quarantine. It works pretty OK!

Great Sound

You might occasionally use voice commands to text someone back or ask Assistant the weather, but the vast majority of your time with the Pixel Buds will be spent listening to music. For audio quality, these are some of the best wireless earbuds I’ve tried.

They've got one of the more nuanced sound signatures I’ve ever heard in portable earbuds. Every instrument comes through with crystal clarity, which makes denser mixes like Foxygen’s ""San Francisco"" come through with elegant depth. You hear the tinny cymbals in the middle, the beautiful piano notes on the far right side, with chugging acoustic guitars on the left. Each has its own musical space.

I’m convinced that the key to such musical detail is the lack of boom in the bass. You can feel and hear every bass drum kick and plucked bass string, but they never overwhelm the low-midrange like on other earbuds. This gives the Pixel Buds a very “flat,” studio-style sound.

If you need oodles of bass to propel you through a workout, these might not be for you. But if you’re after a very detailed, compelling sound, you’ll have a hard time finding better earbuds without spending hundreds more. When it comes to audio quality, they kick the crap out of Apple's cheapest AirPods.

AirPods for Android?

Are these the best wirefree earbuds you can buy for $179? No. I like the Master and Dynamic MW07 Go and Jabra Elite Active 75T just as much as I like these earbuds, and they’ve got better battery life and higher sweatproof ratings.

And unlike more expensive models from the likes of Apple and Sony, these buds don't have any noise canceling. There are understandable reasons why. Noise canceling eats battery life and probably would have made each bud bulkier. The passive noise isolation (the earplug effect of the earbuds in my ears) is more than enough to block out most outside sounds, but you might want to spring for a noise-canceling pair if you're desperate for absolute silence.

Still, I like the Pixel Buds for a different reason. One that’s not really quantifiable when looking at a spec sheet. These are made for the traditional AirPod buyer: someone who wants a pair of headphones that work exactly as expected, every time you use them. For that, they’re the best you’ll find for Android phones. Given the unmitigated disaster that was the first Pixel Buds, I’m thoroughly impressed.",wired,https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-buds-2020#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Shawn Yuan', 'Shawn Yua']",,Inside the Early Days of China’s Coronavirus Coverup,"Late on the night of February 2, as her insomnia kicked in, a Beijing woman whom I’ll call Yue took out her phone and religiously clicked open WeChat and Weibo. Over the past two fitful weeks, the two Chinese social media platforms had offered practically her only windows into the “purgatory,” as she called it, of Wuhan.

At this point, according to official estimates, the novel coronavirus had infected just over 14,000 people in the world—and nearly all of them were in the central Chinese city where Yue had attended university and lived for four years. A number of her friends there had already caught the mysterious virus.

An inveterate news junkie, Yue hadn’t been able to look away from the ghastly updates pouring out of Wuhan, which—interspersed with a dissonant bombardment of posts praising the Chinese government’s iron grip on the outbreak—kept hitting her in an unrelentingly personal way. Her mental health was fraying, and she was “disappointed in humanity,” as she later put it.

That night, just when Yue was about to log off and try to sleep, she saw the following sentence pop up on her WeChat Moments feed, the rough equivalent of Facebook’s News Feed: “I never thought in my lifetime I’d see dead bodies lying around without being collected and patients seeking medical help but having no place to get treatment.”

Yue thought that she had become desensitized, but this post made her fists clench: It was written by Xiao Hui, a journalist friend of hers who was reporting on the ground for Caixin, a prominent Chinese news outlet. Yue trusted her.

She read on. “On January 22, on my second day reporting in Wuhan, I knew this was China’s Chernobyl,” Xiao Hui wrote. “These days I rarely pick up phone calls from outside of Wuhan or chat with friends and family, because nothing can express what I have seen here.”

Unable to contain her anger, Yue took a screenshot of Xiao’s post and immediately posted it on her WeChat Moments. “Look what is happening in Wuhan!” she wrote. Then she finally drifted off.

The next morning, when she opened WeChat, a single message appeared: Her account had been suspended for having “spread malicious rumors” and she would not be able to unblock it. She knew at once that her late-night post had stepped on a censorship landmine.

What she couldn’t have realized, though, was that she had posted her screenshot at what seems to have been a turning point in China’s handling of the epidemic: Over the previous two weeks, the government had allowed what felt like an uncharacteristic degree of openness in the flow of information out of Wuhan. But now the state was embarking on a campaign of censorship and suppression that would be remarkable even by the standards of the Chinese Communist Party.

Over the past several weeks, as the number of new cases in China has tapered off and lockdowns have lifted, China has been positioning itself as a global leader in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. It has vigorously promoted the narrative that its unprecedented quarantine measures bought time for the world—and that much of the world then botched and squandered that head start. Now, the story goes, China has again come to the rescue as it shares its expertise, experience, and equipment.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-early-days-of-chinas-coronavirus-coverup#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Boone Ashworth', 'Boone Ashwort']",,How to Make Your Own Hand Sanitizer,"Properly scrubbing your hands is one of the best ways to stop the spread of germs and viruses, and to ensure you don’t get sick yourself. But if you don't have access to soap and clean water, or if you're out and about and nowhere near a sink, you should carry hand sanitizer to protect your health.

As you're no doubt aware, bottles of hand sanitizer (Purell, Wet Ones, and the like) sell out quickly during public health crises. But don't worry—making your own hand sanitizer is remarkably easy. You just have to be careful you don't mess it up. Make sure that the tools you use for mixing are properly sanitized; otherwise you could contaminate the whole thing. Also, the World Health Organization recommends letting your concoction sit for a minimum of 72 hours after you're done. That way the sanitizer has time to kill any bacteria that might have been introduced during the mixing process.

We actually have two recipes for you, along with links to find the ingredients. The first is one you can make with stuff you likely already have in your cabinets and under the sink, so it's effective in emergency situations. The second recipe is more complex, but easy to make if you have the opportunity to do some shopping and planning ahead of time. Another note: A lot of these items are quickly going out of stock because of high demand. There's a higher chance of finding them at your local drug store, but your first priority is to stay indoors.

Updated April 15: We've refreshed the links in this guide and added some more detailed advice on other standard measures you should be taking.

Potency Matters

You’re going to need some alcohol. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, your sanitizer mix must be at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective. But it's better to get way above that—aim for a minimum of 75 percent. A bottle of 99 percent isopropyl alcohol is the best thing to use. Your regular vodka and whiskey are too wimpy and won’t cut it.

The Quick (Gel) Recipe

Mix 3 parts isopropyl alcohol to 1 part aloe vera gel. Add a few drops of tea tree oil to give it a pleasant scent and to align your chakras.

The Better (Spray) Recipe

The aloe mixture gets the job done, but aloe also leaves your skin annoyingly sticky. So, here's a recipe that's less sticky and more potent, based on the mix recommended by the WHO.

Mix 12 fluid ounces of alcohol with 2 teaspoons of glycerol. You can buy jugs of glycerol online, and it's an important ingredient because it keeps the alcohol from drying out your hands. If you can't find glycerol, proceed with the rest of the recipe anyway and just remember to moisturize your hands after applying the sanitizer.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-make-hand-sanitizer#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1

One chore you can take on with nothing but your smartphone (and a little willpower) is decluttering: there are more apps to help out with this than you might think. Try these out and end your lockdown with more space than you had when you started it.

Go Paperless

Your phone can make quick work of converting all your paper documents into digital versions, tucked away safely in the cloud. A number of apps will use your phone camera as a scanner, converting photos to PDFs along the way and cropping documents down to size.

We like Google Drive for this, because it makes the text inside PDFs searchable as well, and offers a variety of ways of managing your scanned documents (including folders and starred files). Unfortunately, the scan-to-PDF function is only available in Google Drive for Android: tap the Plus icon (lower right), then Scan to import a document. You can rotate and crop a snap before saving.

Google Drive for Android can scan documents straight into your cloud storage. Google via David Nield

You can upload files using Google Drive for iOS but it's a long-winded process. Take a photo of a document like you would any other photo using the iPhone camera app, then from Photos on iOS, select the picture and tap Share. Choose Print, then on the next screen pinch out on the image, which converts it to a PDF—tap Share again, then choose More and Copy to Drive.

iOS has its own document scanner inside Notes. Open up the app, create a new note, then tap the Camera icon above the keyboard and Scan Documents. As with Google Drive, you get cropping and rotation options, and once the document is saved as a note you can easily export it into another app if needed.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/phone-declutter-your-home-quarantine-coronavirus#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Megan Molteni', 'Megan Molten', 'Meghan Herbst']",,Early Remdesivir Data for Covid-19 Is Finally Here,"In late January and early February, as the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 began to spread outside of China, Andre Kalil was spending more and more time inside his office at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, on the phone and emailing with researchers at the National Institutes of Health. With no known treatments or vaccines against the deadly respiratory virus, the NIH was keen to launch a clinical trial of the most promising candidates, starting with remdesivir, a medicine developed by US-based drugmaker Gilead to treat Ebola. The NIH wanted Kalil to lead that trial.

An infectious disease physician, he was a natural choice for two reasons. One, he’d worked on an unusual trial of Ebola treatments during the 2014–15 West African outbreak that created a new model for evaluating experimental drugs during a public health crisis. And two, he had access to UNMC’s Biocontainment Unit, the largest of 10 nationally-designated centers for treating people with the world’s most infectious deadly diseases. Though the US had only a handful of Covid-19 patients at that time, sooner or later there would be more, and Kalil knew they’d probably wind up in Omaha. “We’re one of the few centers in the country that can receive US patients from other countries during an outbreak, so we viewed it as just a matter of time,” he told WIRED in a recent interview.

Sure enough, on February 17, 13 Americans arrived jet-lagged, exhausted, and sick or suspected of having Covid-19. They had just endured a 10-hour evacuation flight from Japan on a chartered cargo jet, and before that, more than two weeks of floating quarantine aboard the doomed Diamond Princess cruise ship.

Just over a week later, three of those cruise ship patients signed up to be the first participants in the federal government’s clinical trial, the first in the US to evaluate experimental Covid-19 treatments. For 10 days, they received a two-hour daily intravenous infusion of a clear liquid that contained either remdesivir—a molecule that impersonates the virus’s genetic building blocks, disrupting its ability to replicate—or a placebo of sterile saltwater solution. They didn't know which one they were getting. Their doctors didn’t know either. But UNMC researchers would carefully collect measurements of how each patient fared. Later, as the disease continued to spread, they would add that information to similar data that would eventually be gathered from more than a thousand other Covid-19 patients at more than 68 hospitals in the US and 21 other countries in Europe and Asia.

This week, the NIH offered the first peek at results from the closely watched study. In a statement released Wednesday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases—the NIH branch that is conducting the trial—said preliminary data shows remdesivir speeds up the recovery of some Covid-19 patients. “Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo,” according to the statement.

The finding, though modest, would represent the first treatment shown to improve outcomes in patients infected with the coronavirus, which as of Thursday had sickened 3.2 million people worldwide. At least 1 million of those are in the US, where the official death toll has reached more than 60,000. However, it’s difficult to evaluate the results without full, detailed data about the patients, how sick they were, and any potential side effects, which the NIAID did not provide. That information is expected to be released within days, according to NIAID director Anthony Fauci, who revealed the study’s results during a meeting with reporters Wednesday afternoon at the White House.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/early-remdesivir-data-for-covid-19-is-finally-here#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Garrett M. Graff', 'Garrett M. Graf']",,An Oral History of the Day Everything Changed,"In the end, as history will record, the story that would have been the biggest news on Wednesday, March 11—the story that in normal times might have been the biggest headline of the month—will hardly register in America’s memory: That morning, at 11:06 am, a judge sentenced Hollywood super-producer turned super-predator Harvey Weinstein to 23 years in prison on sexual assault charges.

Yet within 12 hours, the staggering fact that Weinstein—the force behind an entire generation of movie classics from Shakespeare in Love to Pulp Fiction—might very well spend the rest of his life in prison turned out not only not to be the biggest story of the day, it wasn’t even the biggest Hollywood story of the day.

Instead, Wednesday, March 11, the 71st day of 2020, proved to be unlike any other in American history—the pivot point on which weeks of winter unease about the looming novel coronavirus turned in a matter of hours into a sudden, wrenching, nation-altering halt to daily life and routine. Just a day earlier, Americans across much of the country were still going into the office, meeting friends for drinks, and shaking hands in meetings. That morning, the number of coronavirus cases in the US crossed the 1,000 mark, up 10-fold from the prior week. Only 29 Americans had died.

But on that Wednesday, the World Health Organization, which had only begun referring to the virus as Covid-19 a month earlier, declared the disease a global pandemic. Every hour seemed to bring major new developments: On Wall Street, after days of huge up-and-down gyrations, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,465 points and officially entered bear territory; Capitol Hill faced its first confirmed Covid-19 case; the NCAA announced it would play its basketball tournament without fans; and then, in rapid-fire succession that evening, President Trump gave an Oval Office address, announcing a travel ban from Europe, the NBA suspended its season after player Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus, and Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita, posted on Instagram that they too had been diagnosed while in Australia and were recuperating.

By Thursday, the national landscape had been undeniably altered, and Americans were panic-buying toilet paper. A whole new vocabulary—WFH, PPE, flattening the curve, social distancing, self-isolation, Zoom-bombing, and quarantinis—loomed ahead. Epochal events that had occurred just weeks earlier, from the Australian wildfires to President Trump’s impeachment trial to the drama of the Democratic primary, would seem instead to have occurred years ago.

Within a month, thousands would be killed by the virus, as hospitals from New York to Detroit to New Orleans were overwhelmed, and more than 100,000 had been sickened. The economy would slide into a virus-induced coma, and some 17.7 million Americans would lose their jobs over the next month—a number larger than the populations of all but four states. Not even Harvey Weinstein would escape the drama: He tested positive for the virus on March 23.

To capture the moment that everything in American life changed—launching us into an uncertain future of unknown duration—WIRED collected the stories and memories of more than 30 people who lived March 11’s drama first-hand, from the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange to a basketball arena in Dallas to Capitol Hill to the airports of Europe.

I. The Days Before

Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control (2009-2017): By the end of January, I was saying this is either going to be bad or it’s going to be very, very bad. All through February, we were all trying to figure out how bad is this going to be?

Peter Tuchman, stock trader, Quattro Securities: We’ve been on a wild tear for a year.

"['Daniel Oberhaus', 'Daniel Oberhau', 'Katie M. Palmer', 'Matt Simon']",,The World Is Still Producing More Oil Than It Needs. Why?,"Something weird happened on the oil market last week. For a few minutes on April 20, the price of a barrel went negative for the first time ever. The unprecedented collapse of prices is linked to the pandemic, which has caused people to stop doing oil-guzzling things like flying and driving. There’s now so much extra petroleum on the market that the world is running out of places to put it. If you’re an oil producer, it seems like the sensible thing to do in this situation would be to … stop producing so much oil.

On Friday, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia, the US, and others will begin scaling back their production by nearly 10 million barrels per day. They hope that this will help stabilize prices and take some pressure off of producers and refineries that are scrambling to find a place to store the excess. But the rollback isn’t likely to be enough. Oil producers would have to reduce production by almost three times that amount to match the downturn in demand. So why don’t they?

The WIRED Guide to Climate Change The world is getting warmer, the weather is getting worse. Here's everything you need to know about what humans can do to stop wrecking the planet.

The short answer is because temporarily closing or “shutting in” a well costs money—and potentially lots of money. It’s not just about the foregone revenue, which is less of a concern when prices are dipping into the negative. It’s about what happens when the well is opened back up. “Shutting in a well is not especially difficult,” says Eric van Oort, a petroleum engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. It’s mostly a matter of shutting off a master valve at the surface, much like turning off a faucet. But, he says, “operators are generally reluctant to shut in their wells if they don’t absolutely have to, because they know they’re going to incur some damage on those wells.”

The US has been the largest producer of crude oil in the world for the past two years, and the vast majority is dredged up in Texas and on offshore derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. On land, most of America’s crude is produced from shale reservoirs, which trap the oil in rocks with low permeability. To set it free, companies use a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that opens cracks in rocks deep in the Earth by blasting them with water or gas.

Shut-ins are a normal part of oil production, but they are usually limited to a few wells at a time and mostly undertaken for repairs. Petroleum producers have known for decades that shale wells that have previously been shut in produce less oil when they’re reopened, says John McLennan, an expert in geomechanics at the University of Utah Energy and Geoscience Institute. But the exact cause of the damage is often unclear. McLennan says that one of the most well-supported explanations is water blockage.

A well typically taps into a mixture of oil and water. Both are pumped to the surface, but the water is treated as waste. When a well is shut in, the ratio of oil to water is recalibrated, since there’s no longer a big pipe sucking on the fissures in the rock. Because the rock in shale wells isn’t very permeable, water may accumulate in the fractures. When the well opens up again, it may end up producing more water than oil, because the accumulated H 2 O impedes the movement of oil. Shale wells typically operate on thin profit margins, so even a relatively small loss in productivity could make the well unprofitable.

Van Oort says the amount of time a well is closed doesn’t really affect how much damage the shut-in inflicts on the reservoir. Once the well is closed, the damage is done. If producers have to repeatedly shut the well, the damage can compound over time and reduce productivity even more. “It is always best to leave the well alone once you go to production,” says van Oort.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/the-world-is-still-producing-more-oil-than-it-needs-why#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Arielle Pardes', 'Arielle Parde']",,"Amazon, Instacart, Target Workers Unite for May Day Strike","On Friday, front-line workers from Amazon, Instacart, Shipt, Target, and Whole Foods have organized to walk out of their jobs together over demands that their companies provide better pay, benefits, and protections. Some of these workers deliver packages; others deliver groceries. Some stock shelves in warehouses, and others ring up customers in stores. Some of them are classified as independent contractors and others as employees. But all of them claim that the companies they work for have denied them basic protections on the job, even as the pandemic poses greater risks to their health and safety. Despite being classified as essential workers in a crisis, they say, their companies treat them as disposable.

Worker dissatisfaction at these companies has been simmering for years. But the pandemic, which has placed these workers under a spotlight, has raised the temperature significantly. Friday’s strike follows individual walk-outs at Amazon warehouses and Whole Foods stores, as well as protests from delivery workers at Instacart and Shipt. It marks the first time workers from all those companies will strike together as one united force with similar demands.

“An Amazon warehouse worker has different rights and protections than an Instacart shopper,” says Vanessa Bain, an Instacart worker who helped plan Friday’s strike. “But at the end of the day, our organizing should be interconnected. We're all in this struggle as workers who are deemed essential, on the front lines, and we’re struggling against giants.”

Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, and Target, which owns Shipt, are among the nation’s largest retailers. Instacart, too, is valued at billions of dollars. Each company has hundreds of thousands of workers across the country; Amazon and Instacart are hiring thousands more, as shutdowns dramatically increased demand. In press releases and statements, all three companies say they take workers’ safety seriously and have spent millions of dollars to support their workforces during the pandemic.

The protesters share many of the same demands, including increased hazard pay, expanded sick-leave policies, and stricter cleaning and social distancing measures to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus in facilities. Companies announced new measures as the number of Covid-19 cases in the US grew, and with it safety concerns. Amazon and Target both raised wages by $2 an hour, expanded sick leave, and increased cleaning at facilities. But some of the policies have been temporary: Amazon, for example, provided unlimited unpaid leave for workers but only until the end of April. And the workers who have spoken out—along with groups with names like Target Workers Unite, Amazonians United, Whole Worker, and Gig Workers Collective—say their companies should do more.

That workers are now looking outside their own company isn’t surprising, some experts say. “The problem isn’t unique to Instacart, or Target, or Whole Foods. The problem is across essential work,” says Benjamin Sachs, a labor law expert at Harvard Law School.

Even several groups of workers banding together may not be able to effectively withhold labor enough to force companies to meet their demands. Organizers say their bases number in the tens of thousands, but that represents a minuscule part of the overall workforce of these companies. And even reaching that level of participation may be difficult. One Instacart worker, who was asked by WIRED about Friday’s strike, said she’d never heard it was happening; another said she had seen shoppers talking about it on Reddit but had no intention of participating, “because Instacart won’t even blink.”

Instacart workers already staged one nationwide strike on March 30, which Bain says had thousands of participants. Instacart says that had “absolutely no impact” on its operations; in fact, it reported 40 percent more workers picking up groceries that day than one week before. The company did announce it would supply its shoppers with safety gear, but dozens of workers have since complained about the availability and quality of those products. Organizers say their other demands, like hazard pay and extended sick leave, have gone unmet.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-instacart-target-coronavirus-may-day-strike#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Louryn Strampe', 'Louryn Stramp']",,How to Cut Your Hair at Home,"So, your hair is getting long, and all of the salons are closed because of a global pandemic. It may be time to cut your own hair at home. Stylists will advise you to avoid getting too overzealous with your scissors, but sometimes you're left with no choice. Cutting your hair is more complicated than it looks, and this guide is not one-size-fits-all, but it should help you at least figure out the basics on where to start.

Updated April 24: We've refreshed some of the links in this guide.

If you buy something using the links in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate commission. Here’s how this works. You can also support our reporting and reviewing by purchasing a 1-year print + digital WIRED subscription for $5 (Discounted).

Do You Really Need a Cut?

There are plenty of ways to change your look without being extreme or doing something you may regret. As my hairstylist Angela Layng says, ""We never make our best hair decisions when we're stressed."" Additionally, the stylists I interviewed emphasized the fact that home haircuts can go awry quickly. Just take a look at the videos of people trying to give themselves bangs.

Before you make any permanent changes to your hair, consider some temporary ones. Now is a great time to grow out your hair. Is your hair fried from repetitive heat damage? Break the heat-styling cycle and your mane will be looking its best in no time. If you've played with the idea of changing your part, go through the transition while you're at home.

You can also fake a hair transformation. Create a faux bob with the help of some bobby pins. If your hair is long enough to put into a ponytail, you can use creative styling to create fake bangs with no scissors required. Try covering your head in barrettes or learn to fishtail braid. Experiment away!

Brushing your hair is also an underrated way to give your tresses some TLC, according to hairstylist and salon owner Kenzie Veurink. For curly-haired folks, you can achieve a similar treatment by using a wide-toothed comb or your fingers. The goal is to stimulate your scalp and work its natural oils down the length of your hair. It'll help your strands stay shiny and strong, and there's some evidence that scalp stimulation encourages faster hair growth.

Now that you may have more free time, you could slather on a hair treatment mask first thing in the morning and wash it off before you go to bed. You might even have the components for a DIY hair mask in your kitchen already. Ingredients such as mayonnaise, eggs, honey, and apple cider vinegar are great for your hair. Mix 'em up in a bowl and cover your hair, then let the mask sit for as long as you'd like before rinsing.

Gear You May Need

Quality scissors: A sharp edge helps keep your hair from fluffing out at the ends or moving around too much while you trim. Consider using precision scissors or placing an order for hair-cutting shears, which are razor-sharp and should be handled with care.

Hair clippers for short hair: Hair clippers are in short supply right now, but this is a good clipper kit if you can manage to snag it—and this is a good alternative. This self-cutting trimmer might help if you plan to cut your own hair without any help.

Keep These Tips in Mind

Have someone else help: Cutting your own hair in the mirror can be tricky. If you can, get someone to help you trim evenly, or decide when enough is enough. If you have to fly solo, use multiple mirrors and take breaks to check up on how you're looking.

Consider texture and length: A DIY haircut is hard enough for folks with long, thick, straight, healthy hair. If your hair is curly, short, or especially textured, mistakes will be easier to spot, so use caution.

Start small: Have you ever used a magnifying mirror to tweeze your eyebrows, only to step back and realize you've gone too far? The same principle applies to your hair. You can always take off more, but there's no going back once you've snipped away too much. It may help to step away for a few hours before you reassess where you’re at.

Avoid horizontal lines: It might have looked badass when Disney's Mulan did it, but you don't want to hack your hair off in a big horizontal line. Hold your scissors straight up and down the length of your hair, rather than across it, and snip away just a little bit at a time. This is especially important if you're working on bangs. Horizontal lines are sometimes necessary for removing length, but snipping vertically keeps your hair from becoming too blunt—a telltale sign of at-home haircuts. If you've cut horizontally, make sure to follow it up with vertical snips to thin out the ends and make the cut look more natural. If you aren't feeling dextrous enough to cut vertically, try holding your scissors diagonally.

How to Trim Your Hair

Be conservative. This is likely your first time, so trim your hair—don't try to restyle it entirely. If in doubt, you can always wait and book an appointment with your favorite stylist once shelter-in-place orders are lifted. Below is our best trimming advice, along with some links to tutorials that will help you, depending on your hair's length and texture.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-cut-your-own-hair-at-home#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Will Knight', 'Will Knigh']",,The Cubicle Is Back. Blame (or Thank) the Coronavirus,"The cubicle is making a comeback.

As thousands of companies contemplate restarting operations, executives are weighing how best to reconfigure workspaces that have, by and large, been designed to minimize cost and foster the face-to-face interactions that can spread the deadly coronavirus.

Some companies are looking at high-tech approaches to enforce social distancing and track interactions, with location-monitoring apps and badges, artificial intelligence surveillance cameras, and high-tech health checks. Other innovations will be simpler: stickers to enforce 6 feet of distance between coworkers; staggered shifts that allow for more spacing; more regular cleanings; and of course oodles of hand sanitizer.

But one of the most important innovations may turn out to be cardboard or plastic dividers that turn open-plan offices into something more reminiscent of the 1980s.

“You’re gonna see a lot of plexiglass,” says Michael Boonshoft, a spokesperson for Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate company that has drawn up guidelines for reopening office spaces. “Having that divider will make people feel safer. That shield between desks will be really important.”

Cushman & Wakefield is importing innovations from offices it operates in China, where it has helped more than a million people return to work. Besides temperature checkpoints, masks, sanitizer, and wipes, the guidelines recommend rearranging desks and meeting room seating to ensure social distancing, having workers use disposable desk covers, and installing dividers between workspaces.

“Companies aren't going to have a ton of time and money to create a whole new office concept in a month,” Boonshoft says. “So these are quick- and inexpensive-to-implement ideas.”

“You’re gonna see a lot of plexiglass.” Michael Boonshoft, Cushman & Wakefield

WeWork, the on-demand office space company, has kept some sites open to support essential businesses during the pandemic. Last week the company shared with members a blueprint for maintaining safety at its locations. Measures include rules on social distancing at shared desks and in meeting rooms and kitchens, regular cleaning, and modifications of air-conditioning systems to reduce recirculation that might spread the virus. But a representative says the company is considering other steps, including installing partitions in what had been open office spaces.

“Partitions are really hot right now,” says Ben Waber, president and cofounder of Humanyze, a company that analyzes digital and physical communications between office workers to gauge productivity and collaboration.

Humanyze is working with clients including Panasonic in Japan to determine how to redesign office layouts to minimize potentially dangerous interactions without cutting off communication. The company measures workers’ movements inside buildings using anonymous data from smart ID badges.

Waber says a key challenge will be balancing new safety measures with opportunities for productive interactions: “At the end of the day, the only reason to be in an office is to collaborate.”

Cubicles appeared in US offices in the 1960s as a way to encourage personalization, movement, and meaningful interactions among office workers, according to Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace, by Nikil Saval. Robert Propst, a designer at Herman Miller, came up with the idea for a modular, low-cost, cubicle-filled space as an antidote to the rows of typing desks that were common at the time.

“Partitions are really hot right now.” Ben Waber, president, Humanyze

Over the following decades, however, the cubicle ironically became associated with regimented, monotonous, and depersonalized office life. It fell out of favor early in this century, as Silicon Valley startups embraced open offices to encourage collaboration, and companies elsewhere mimicked the idea.

Some businesses are eyeing more high-tech tools for ensuring social distancing and preventing the spread of the virus.

Smart cameras may be one way to guard against unsafe worker behavior. SmartVid.io, which makes AI surveillance systems for identifying unsafe situations at construction sites without identifying individuals, last month developed software to warn managers when workers fail to maintain safe distances from each other. CEO Josh Kanner says it is working on an upgrade that will detect whether workers are wearing masks.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/cubicle-is-back-blame-thank-coronavirus#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Angela Watercutter', 'Angela Watercutte', 'Emma Grey Ellis']",,An AI Meme Generator Gives Us the Absurdist Art We All Need,"Drake advocating a coup. Distracted Boyfriend casting his gaze toward carbs. Leonardo DiCaprio suggesting it’s time to have a dick. Truly none of these things make sense. Yet as people worldwide are fully in their second month of coronavirus quarantine (or should be), they’re all oddly hilarious notions. Perhaps it’s stir-craziness, but the images burped out by the AI meme generator—a recently added feature of the site Imgflip—make a random kind of sense. At a time when nothing is rational or orderly (somehow, large gatherings of people are threatening herd immunity, know what I mean?), jokes created by machine learning aren’t what anyone would call “good” or “hilarious,” but they do reflect a certain kind of fractured collective psyche. Why not enjoy them? If AI can’t stop this pandemic, the least it can do is provide some absurdist art.

Titled, wryly, This Meme Does Not Exist, the tool is very simple: Select from one of dozens of popular memes and let the generator do the rest. Pick Dave Chappelle’s Tyrone Biggums’ Y’all Got Any More of That meme and it’ll spit out something about emails. Choose Yoda and he’ll come back with a joke about your mom. The actual words themselves come from a corpus of some 100 million captions submitted to Imgflip’s meme generator. To keep things simple, the site trained its AI using just the 48 most popular memes and 20,000 captions per meme, for 960,000 captions total. “However, since we are building a generational model there will be one training example for each character in the caption, totaling ~45,000,000 training examples,” Imgflip founder Dylan Wenzlau wrote in a very thorough blog post describing the tool’s creation. “Character-level generation rather than word-level was chosen here because memes tend to use spelling and grammar … uh … creatively.” Put another way, the machine doesn’t generate each meme word by word but character by character. Hence really complex—and at times bizarre—word combinations. Memes used creative syntax to begin with; having it fed into an AI and regenerated makes it look like something put through Google Translate too many times.

It also looks like something akin to art. There’s an almost collage-like aspect to the images the meme generator is producing, like it’s feeding the internet’s twisted humor back to it as a form of commentary. The computer didn’t just look at DiCaprio and think, “Hm, something about dicks … ?” It came up with that based on things others had already said. Same with Distracted Boyfriend and bread. There’s something inherently surrealist about it. The project’s name invokes other AI image experiments like This Person Does Not Exist or This Cat Does Not Exist, but it also seems to echo ""This is not a pipe."" The early 20th century had Magritte; the early 21st century has memes. The treachery of images remains the same.

That is likely why the AI meme generator has taken off. Wenzlau posted his first paper on the project a little over a year ago, and researchers at Stanford have been using machine learning to make memes for nearly two years. Yet it’s only been recently, perhaps even in the last 24 hours, that social media has latched onto these memes. Such are the ways of the internet; memes that fall in the woods don’t get LOLs, memes that land on Twitter do.

That said, this time feels most ripe for this kind of humor. Amid coronavirus’s virulent march, lockdowns, protests against lockdowns, and daily White House briefings that feel disconnected from the experiences of everyday Americans, everything feels absurdist. There is senseless death, and even more senseless politicking around it. People are turning to social media in droves to find connection and maybe relief. Some laughs would help, but the web’s collective sense of humor feels tapped out. Joking about a pandemic can be a much needed release, but who wants to crack wise? Maybe it’s time to let the computers take this one.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/ai-meme-generator-coronavirus#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Lauren Smiley', 'Lauren Smile', 'Meghan Herbst']",,27 Days in Tokyo Bay: What Happened on the Diamond Princess,"Before dawn on the 5th of February, Captain Gennaro Arma sipped espresso in his tidy office, wondering how bad the news would be. He wore a crisp black uniform with shiny brass buttons and lifted the tiny cup with fingers swathed in cheap latex gloves. The passengers on the Diamond Princess were mostly asleep, and Arma, not long awake himself, brooded over the possibilities. He hoped for a Return to Normal: He would thunder up the engines and glide the Diamond from its anchored stillness out in Tokyo Bay into the port of Yokohama. Passengers would trudge down the gangway, Samsonites rumbling, a little befuddled by their brush with calamity but on their way. Then there was That Other Option, less clear and more ominous. Hearing a knock—there they are—Arma strapped on a surgeon's mask, opened the door, and greeted two Japanese health officers who strode in, also wearing gloves and masks, ready to deliver the verdict.

Two weeks earlier, on January 20, Arma had sailed the Diamond southwest from Yokohama for a 14-day cruise to China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, then back to Japan. Three days into the voyage, news reports arrived that China had shut down all travel from and within Wuhan, an inland city of 11 million, in an attempt to squelch a new coronavirus. Then, in the predawn hours of February 2, Princess Cruises' vice president of maritime operations had awoken Arma with preliminary information that a passenger in his eighties who had left the ship in Hong Kong eight days earlier had since tested positive for the same virus. The captain was told to speed back early from Okinawa to Tokyo Bay, so that passengers and crew could be screened. Ferrying out to meet the ship late on February 3, health workers boarded and spent that night and the next day walking cabin to cabin, asking if people were feverish or coughing, taking temperatures and swabbing throats.

Now the health officers were back with the first set of test results: The coronavirus hadn't disembarked with the elderly man in Hong Kong. Ten of the 31 results at that point were also positive. Nine passengers. One food worker.

While they spoke, the captain's thoughts went to the 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members. Those 10 people probably had roommates. How far had it spread?

Arma had spent more than 25 years at sea. Just five months earlier, in these same waters, he had faced his most arduous trial yet, white-knuckling the Diamond's helm against Typhoon Faxai. He had held the bow straight into 100-mph winds, lest they catch the cruise liner's massive flank and fling it around like a toy boat in a Jacuzzi. He accepted the sea's hierarchy—“You can't beat Mother Nature, but you can come to a compromise”—so all night he negotiated, gunning the engines and thrusters to keep the 115,875-ton behemoth in place, the nautical version of running on a treadmill. You didn't hear about a Princess cruise ship slamming into a cargo vessel or capsizing last September, because he succeeded.

“We got through Faxai. We'll get through this,” a staff captain told Arma upon hearing of the virus aboard the ship. Arma preferred Faxai. This new coronavirus wasn't something he knew how to navigate.

The legal authority for the ship's safety had shifted to the Japanese government. Those officials, in turn, had pondered a real-life version of the trolley problem: The ship was carrying 3,711 people, any one of whom could be harboring a potentially fatal disease to which no one had immunity. No option was good. A ham-handed disembarkation risked unleashing the virus within Japan, which at that point had only 20 known cases and was hosting the Summer Olympics in just five months' time. Send passengers to their home countries without ensuring they were healthy and Japan would be blamed for spreading the contagion. Yet the last choice—a quarantine, albeit in a glamorous prison—presented a danger, even an inevitability, of sickening many on board. And given that 60 percent of the cruisegoers were 60 years or older, with weaker immune systems, an infection could mean death.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/diamond-princess-coronavirus-covid-19-tokyo-bay#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Louise Matsakis', 'Louise Matsaki']",,How to Use TikTok: Tips for New Users,"It’s been more than three years since the lip-syncing app Musical.ly, now known as TikTok, first became popular among tweens and teens. The social network has since spread far beyond Generation Z: TikTok has been downloaded over 1 billion times, including 96 million in the United States, according to estimates from the research firm Sensor Tower. It’s also owned by the Chinese company Bytedance, now considered one of the most valuable startups in the world. The app itself revolves around sharing 15-second videoclips, which are set to music often licensed from artists and record labels.

TikTok is now beloved not only by lip-syncing 14-year-olds, but also by comedians, athletes, and, yes, brands. Major corporations like Coca-Cola, Nike, ABC, and Google have run advertising campaigns on TikTok. Even Khloé Kardashian has been paid to post sponsored content on the platform. But the app isn’t just home to ads: TikTok is also ground zero for some of the internet’s most popular memes.

You can be forgiven if you feel like you don’t understand TikTok. The app is fast-paced and chaotic, combining elements of Spotify, Snapchat, Vine, and Twitch into a single social network. Here’s what you need to know to get started, from TikTok “Challenges” to Coins and Original sounds.

Getting Started: Set Up Your Account

The first thing you’ll need is a pair of headphones. There’s just no way to enjoy TikTok with the sound off. After you download the app, you can immediately start browsing videos. But in order to post any yourself, you’ll need to sign up for an account.

You can make an account using your email, your phone number, or a third-party platform like Facebook. The app automatically assigns you a username. If you sign up for TikTok with your phone number, the app will generate a generic username such as user1234567. Using an email address generates a more personalized ID (although that may present a privacy issue for users).

To change your username, tap the icon in the right bottom corner that looks like a person’s upper body. Then hit Edit Profile. Here, you can change it to something more unique, as well as add a bio, picture, and Profile Video.

By default, TikTok accounts are public, meaning anyone can see your profile and view the videos you post. To adjust these privacy settings, tap the three dots in the top right corner of your profile.

Navigating TikTok

Now that your profile is ready to go, it’s time to watch some TikToks. The app is divided into two main feeds. The default is For You, an algorithmically generated stream of videos akin to Instagram’s Explore page. Swipe left and you’ll find the other, Following, which features uploads from people you choose to follow. TikTok is like a never-ending variety show; it’s pure entertainment. Follow creators who make you laugh, like @k.chh, who posts hilarious skits, or opt instead for adorable accounts like @cute_puppies12, which posts the tiniest dogs I’ve ever seen.

You’ll notice to the right of every TikTok video a series of icons. The first will take you to the profile of the user who posted it. Then there’s a heart, which functions just like hearts, or likes, on Instagram. Next are comments, then a right-pointing arrow for sharing individual TikToks to other platforms. Click the arrow if you want to copy the link to a specific TikTok, for example, to share it on iMessage. (One note for left-handers: You might find TikTok hard to use, at least at first, since it’s often right-oriented.)",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-tik-tok#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Emma Grey Ellis', 'Emma Grey Elli', 'Meghan Herbst']",,Covid-19 Is Killing Black People Unequally—Don't Be Surprised,"Ala Stanford is a doctor, but right now her office is a parking lot, a street corner, the sidewalk outside of a Philadelphia Baptist church. Stanford leads a mobile unit of doctors who are bringing free Covid-19 testing to the neighborhoods in Philadelphia that are being hit hardest by the virus: underserved black communities. Across the United States, black Americans are contracting and dying of Covid-19 at wildly disproportionate rates, and in some areas, they aren’t being tested for the virus nearly as frequently as their white peers, either.

Stanford and her cohort, who call themselves the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, are dedicated to combating the much discussed but poorly addressed crisis where it lives, armed only with nasal swabs, educational materials, and personal protective equipment. They’re able to pay for those necessities because this week they successfully raised more than $100,000 on GoFundMe. Money for lifesaving medical treatment during a pandemic is coming not from government coffers but from the whims and wallets of the internet.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that several racial minority groups account for a disproportionate number of the Covid-19 cases and fatalities in the United States, but the black community in particular is suffering. In Wisconsin, a state that is only 6 percent black, black people account for about half of its Covid-19 deaths. In Chicago, black people account for 70 percent of deaths due to Covid-19 but make up only 30 percent of its population. In Richmond, Virginia, all but one of the people who have died of Covid-19 were black. “I’ll tell you the first thing I said when I saw the disparities in fatality rates,” says Louis Penner, a professor emeritus at Wayne State University who studies racial disparities in health care. “I said, ‘People are surprised?’”

Anybody who is paying attention knows that the gulf between the health statistics of white and black Americans has existed for decades, or, really, centuries. Covid-19 is just the latest manifestation of an old and ugly trend. The explanation for it is at once simple—racism—and incredibly complex. Structural inequalities have kept black Americans significantly poorer than their white counterparts, and economic disparity creates health disparities, especially during a pandemic. Black people (and other minority populations) tend to live in more polluted, more densely populated areas, have more people per household, and are overrepresented in settings where people are unable to effectively social distance, like prisons and homeless shelters. They disproportionately work jobs currently considered essential, yet also are far less likely to have paid sick leave, enough savings to take time off, or a grocery store nearby enough to stock up easily.

Many of these factors, from living in food deserts to lacking health insurance, add up to mean that black communities also suffer at higher rates from acute and chronic medical conditions. “My colleagues knew this was going to be an issue months ago, as soon as we started hearing that preexisting conditions like obesity, diabetes, chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases are all risk factors for dying of Covid-19,” Penner says.

Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.

On top of creating the black community’s ongoing health crisis, systemic racism is also a barrier to treatment. According to Shervin Assari, a health inequality researcher at Charles R. Drew University, one of the only historically black medical schools in the nation, while white people prefer to get their health information from medical providers and the media, black people rate health-related information they receive from family members and churches more highly. The reason for this isn’t poor education (although it’s another structurally unequal factor), it’s due to longstanding and justified mistrust. “We found that racial prejudice amongst physicians affects how they interact with black patients,” Penner says. “Even in very short, highly structured interactions between physicians and patients, black patients pick up on this and react to it.”",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-coronavirus-racial-disparities#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Jerrine Tan', 'Jerrine Ta', 'Meghan Herbst']",,What Singapore Can Tell the World About Personal Liberty,"In mid-January I returned to the US from a visit home to Singapore, where people were already worried about the novel coronavirus spreading in China. All through February, it was bizarre to observe business as usual in the US. Western media reports mostly critiqued the authoritarian lockdown measures implemented by China—the same measures that have since been adopted in various forms across the world as it became clear that containment was key to managing the crisis. Complacency and an unwillingness to call for severe restrictions to mobility early on in the name of not violating individual liberty doomed the US to its ongoing crisis.

Donald Trump’s refusal to take the virus seriously and the delays in lockdown were myopic, prideful, and willfully ignorant. Western liberal democracies will not emerge from this crisis with much—or any—moral or political clout. The US and UK all but bungled their early responses. Instead, the world will look to places that have handled this crisis well, or at least better.

WIRED OPINION ABOUT Jerrine Tan was born and raised in Singapore. She has a PhD in English from Brown University and currently teaches Global Anglophone Literature in the English department at Mount Holyoke College. Her writing has appeared in Asian American Writers Workshop and is forthcoming in Modern Fiction Studies.

In the early stages of the outbreak, Singapore was roundly lauded for its prompt and efficient response, ensuring a quick flattening of the curve. But if we are to learn lessons from Singapore, they should be clear-eyed, understanding how and why it was able to respond in the ways it did, not only in a time of crisis but also because of how it operated before.

The Singapore government, synonymous with the PAP (People's Action Party), managed the first wave of infections well. Its system of contact-tracing is world-class. Masks were rationed and distributed. As the second wave of imported infections started rolling in, hotels served as dedicated quarantine rooms for returning Singaporeans, which ensured safe and proper physical distancing while propping up the ailing hotel industry and saving jobs.

But managing a crisis well does not mean that the problematic aspects of a government go away. In fact, effective crisis management can be aided by these characteristics. In The Economist, Kishore Mahbubani chalks the success of China, South Korea, and Singapore up to “quality of governance and cultural confidence of their societies.” But this claim is reductive. The PAP is notorious for draconian censorship laws, harsh retaliation against dissenters, and the suppression of other political parties. In the past month, the appeal to repeal Section 377A, a relic of colonial law criminalizing sex between two men, was dismissed. A local activist was jailed for unfavorably comparing Singapore’s judiciary system to Malaysia’s. These events largely passed unremarked due to the onslaught of Covid-19 news. On the back of Wired, CNN, and Time praising Singapore’s response in early March, the Singapore government made moves which political commentators have read as suggesting the possibility of snap elections, including announcing the new electoral boundaries on March 13, as if to leverage goodwill in the midst of crisis to solidify political power. But should the government call for elections soon, not only will opposition parties be at a distinct disadvantage, the health of the population will also be put at risk.

Is freedom and a robust democracy the price to pay for effective crisis management?

In late March, as flights from the US to Singapore got canceled for the indefinite future, I found myself grappling for the first time in my life with the existential and psychic pain of not being able to return home if I wanted to. Remaining in a country that quickly surged to have the most cases in the world, I began to wonder about the price I was willing to pay to ensure that the Singapore government acted in a way that would secure the safety of my family. As a child, I used to lie awake at night in fear, imagining the deaths of my loved ones, and brokering silent deals with god. Give my parents one more year of life and I swear I’ll do my homework every day. As the Covid-19 pandemic worsened across the US, and Singapore braced to face a second wave, I found myself sinking into helpless worry and again making wishful deals in the dark—this time not with god but with my government: Get Singapore through this. If my parents stay healthy until I can get home, I swear I’ll never speak ill of the government again. In a state of emergency, more than a few of us will find ourselves cutting deals with god, the devil, or the government alike.

"['Aarian Marshall', 'Aarian Marshal']",,Elon Musk Says Tesla Stock Is ‘Too High’—and It Quickly Falls,"He’s at it again.

Launching a Friday morning tweet-tear, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote, “Tesla stock price is too high imo [in my opinion].” Ask, believe, receive: The electric-car maker’s stock price immediately began to dip, finishing the day down 10 percent.

It’s curious for any executive to say the company’s stock is too high. It’s especially curious for Musk—even though, in just the past 48 hours, the billionaire has tweeted (then deleted) an image of a cursing unicorn topped by American flags and a pledge to rid himself of nearly all material possessions. That’s because Musk has been sued by US securities regulators for posting about his business before. To settle that case, he agreed to have tweets about Tesla reviewed by the company’s lawyers.

The tweet topped off a wild week for the automaker, which announced a surprise profit in the first three months of the year despite Covid-19-related closures at its assembly plants in Shanghai and California. But Musk received more attention for his remarks—launched on Twitter and continued on a call with analysts Wednesday—complaining that shelter-in-place orders were “forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights” and “fascist.”

A CEO calling the company’s stock price overvalued could hurt the enterprise and its investors in the short term. “Very few CEOs have ever said this—or anything close,” says John Coffee, who directs the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University Law School.

Still, Coffee says he’s not sure Musk could get in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the missive. “It is hard to impossible to call this fraudulent, and it is a statement of opinion,” he says, the sort of thing a company executive is permitted to say. “I tend to doubt that the SEC will choose to take on this one.”

Others aren’t as sure. Because Musk knows more about his company—material, nonpublic information—than its investors, it's possible the CEO is using Twitter to manipulate the price of Tesla stock and lead investors to buy or sell, says Stephen Diamond, a professor of corporate finance and securities regulation at the Santa Clara University School of Law. It’s a real problem for Musk if the tweet is misleading, he says, and could lead to more scrutiny from regulators. It’s an even real-er problem if the tweet can be linked with any sort of trading activity, including stock buybacks. Musk could be accused of insider trading.

“The problem is that this is Elon Musk.” Stephen Diamond, Santa Clara University School of Law

The tweet is especially risky for Musk and company because of their prior clashes with the SEC. Both Musk and Tesla paid $20 million apiece in September 2018 to settle with the SEC over a tweet in which the CEO said he had the funding to take Tesla private—a statement that was untrue. As part of that settlement, Musk agreed to have any communications that could contain information “material” to Tesla reviewed by a company lawyer, including tweets.",wired,https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-stock-too-high-falls#intcid=recommendations_default-popular_6bca1970-70be-4dc4-8177-adfcde3618d7_popular4-1
"['Julie Muncy', 'Julie Munc']",,The Last of Us Part II Gets a Leak—and a New Release Date,"Welcome once again to Replay, WIRED's weekly guide to everything going on in the world of videogames. This week, we've got leaks, announcements, and, uh, Elon Musk. Let's check it out.

The Last of Us Part II Gets Both a New Release Date and a Major Leak

Busy week for those keeping up with news out of Naughty Dog, developer of The Last of Us Part II. First off, the game has a new release date: June 19. (That's later than the original release date of May 29, but probably a relief for fans, considering it appeared to be delayed indefinitely just a few weeks ago.) News of the on-sale day came hand-in-hand with word of a major leak of a development build of the game, setting off a series of rumors and debates over who did the leak, why, and whether or not it might have been justified. The initial rumor was that a disgruntled employee had leaked the game to protest poor labor conditions, though Sony has gone on the record as of Friday to say that the leaker in question, according to its investigation, wasn't affiliated with Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.

The leak itself, featuring major spoilers about the game's narrative, surfaced last weekend, with footage from a late-in-development build of the game. It included gameplay as well as a number of important cutscenes. So if you're not interested in getting spoiled for this particular title, you might want to tread carefully.

The Next Assassin's Creed Will Meet Again in Valhalla

It's not super clear what connects the games in the Assassin's Creed franchise at this point, what with the broader narrative and aesthetic connections becoming thinner and thinner as time goes on. They all have, uh, murder? Some jumping? Anyway, the new one has vikings! As announced this week, the next game in the series is Assassin's Creed Valhalla, set in the ninth century and starring everyone's favorite raidy boys and girls of the northern hemisphere. In this one, like the last one, you can play as a dude or a lady, and this time you're a member of a Viking clan who, probably, decides to kill a variety of villains based on a personal sense of justice that occasionally overlaps with a broad science fiction-al metaplot that, at this point, we could not even begin to explain to you. It looks fun. It's coming at the end of the year.

Elon Musk Brings Deus Ex Into His Anti-Stay-at-Home Thing

So, here's the deal: Elon Musk, that dude who has a car company and is having a baby with Grimes, recently took to Twitter to heavily protest America's stay-at-home orders, tweeting ""FREE AMERICA NOW"" and applauding the decision of Texas' governor to allow a limited reopening of the state starting today. In the process of doing so, he also changed his Twitter icon to that of JC Denton, the protagonist of the 2000 videogame Deus Ex.
