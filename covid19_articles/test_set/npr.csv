He describes it as a ""leaf blower with a parachute overhead.""

Strap in, and ""your body becomes the fuselage"" — and you are the pilot. Your knees dangle into open air.

For 15 years, the contraption, called a motorized paraglider, has taken photographer George Steinmetz across 25 different countries. From airport to airport, Steinmetz carried his personal aircraft, which could be disassembled and stashed in three bags, each weighing about 50 pounds, that he would proceed to check in.

Launching himself over remote swaths of desert, stark Arctic terrains and cheek-by-jowl shorelines, Steinmetz has documented, from the sky, the way human activity has shaped Earth. The result is The Human Planet: Earth at the Dawn of the Anthropocene, a photographic record of our planet in the anthropocene age — a word that refers to the mark humans have made on the global landscape (""anthropos"" is Greek for human). The accompanying text is by science writer Andrew Revkin.

NPR spoke to Steinmetz about what it was like to glide over some of the most isolated regions in the world — and about the overwhelming signs he saw of humanity's footprint.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What inspired you to begin working on The Human Planet?

The book came out of a project I did for the New York Times Magazine. They asked me to go and photograph climate change on all seven continents from the air. And it made me think more globally than I tend to do, and it filled in a lot of gaps I had in my coverage of the planet. After that was done, I decided it would be interesting to go back through my archive and kind of reinterpret what I've been seeing for the past 30 years, looking at our fragile planet in a different way.

You'd been taking aerial photos for National Geographic as well.

I've been working for National Geographic for over 30 years, and [aerial photos] were always the most fun and exciting part of the story. I started doing that more and more, until finally, I wanted to do a story in the Sahara and realized I had to bring my own aircraft because there were no helicopters or planes to hire in these [areas of] Niger and Chad where I wanted to go. I had to learn how to fly my own thing.

toggle caption George Steinmetz

Could you tell us a bit about what it was like taking pictures aerially?

It's kind of personal because your body is the aircraft. It is some physical risk to go and see the world. You have to have to be fairly committed to taking the picture. And that made it a much richer experience. Now, I used drones a lot and drones are wonderful, but you don't have the same physical commitment.

A lot of the work was done with a motorized paraglider, which is the world's lightest and slowest motorized aircraft. You run to take off and land. It's a very personal kind of aerial photography, [because] there's no barrier between you and the outside.

You have to watch out for your knees getting in the picture.

I had a lot of unusual experiences flying in very rare places — like getting caught in sandstorms, some bad crashes. You have a lot of really epic moments where you see things that no one's ever seen before.

toggle caption George Steinmetz

What were some of those epic moments?

In the empty quarter of Saudi Arabia, [I flew over] the world's largest sand sea. It's about the size of France, Belgium and Holland combined without a single permanent point of water or habitation, and it's [practically] just an endless field of orange sand dunes. You feel like you're hallucinating out there. I also had a really amazing experience flying in the High Andes in the Altiplano of Bolivia. There's a salt lake there called the Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat. It's very surreal, especially in the spring when the fringes of it are covered in water. You feel like it's like something out of a dream. It's really beautiful.

You took these images before the coronavirus crisis, but I wonder if the pandemic has added any new layers of meaning to these photos?

We are in a time when humans have become the dominant force in the land. I think it's time to reflect on what we're all doing with our lives and maybe our place in the world. And I think a book like this brings up a lot of questions.

Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, Singapore was praised as a shining example of how to handle the new virus. The World Health Organization pointed out that Singapore's aggressive contact tracing allowed the city-state to quickly identify and isolate any new cases. It quickly shut down clusters of cases and kept most of its economy — and its schools — open. Through the beginning of April, Singapore had recorded fewer than 600 cases.

By the end of April, however, the case count exceeded 17,000. And not only is all of Singapore now under a strict lockdown, but it has the most coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia.

The vast majority of these cases are in the overcrowded dormitories that house more than 300,000 of Singapore's roughly 1 million foreign workers — and the number of cases is expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks.

""We have started our testing with the dormitories where there were a high number of cases detected,"" Singapore's health minister, Gan Kim Yong, said in a virtual press briefing this week.

Singapore ordered a lockdown on April 7 in response to an uptick in cases in the general population — and then began to find a significant number of cases in the dorms.

Gan says Singapore is now testing more than 3,000 migrant workers a day but hopes to expand that number. The virus is spreading so rapidly in the dormitories, however, that the Health Ministry hasn't been able to test all of the suspected cases.

""For dormitories where the assessed risk of infection is extremely high, our efforts are focused on isolating those who are symptomatic even without a confirmed COVID-19 test,"" Gan says. ""This allows us to quickly provide medical care to these patients.""

Singapore is a small city-state with a population of just under 6 million inhabitants. On a per capita basis, it's the second-richest country in Asia.

But its economy relies heavily on young men from Bangladesh, India and other countries who work jobs in construction and manufacturing. Singapore has no minimum wage for foreign or domestic employees. The foreign workers' salaries can be as low as US$250 per month, but a typical salary is $500 to $600 a month.

Speaking to the media, Gan credited extensive screening in the dorms with finding many workers who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but who didn't appear sick.

""So far, the majority of the cases here have had relatively mild disease or no symptoms. And they do not require extensive medical intervention,"" Gan said. ""About 30% require closer medical observation due to the underlying health conditions or because of old age.""

As of this week, only a handful of the migrant workers — fewer than two dozen — were in intensive care units.

The city-state is setting up thousands of what it calls ""community care beds"" in convention centers and other public buildings to isolate and treat coronavirus patients. The hope is that most of the cases can be managed by medical staff in these temporary wards, rather than in hospitals. So far the city has 10,000 community care beds and plans to expand to 20,000 by mid-June.

It's no surprise that the migrant workers are now being infected, says Mohan Dutta, a professor at Massey University in New Zealand who has done research on these migrant laborers. He says conditions in the dorms put the workers at significant risk of catching a respiratory disease like COVID-19. There are 12 to 20 bunk beds per room.

And even though some of the workers are deemed ""essential,"" most are no longer allowed to leave the dormitories. ""There is little room to move around. They have little room to store their things, which really contributes to this sense of the rooms being unhygienic,"" says Dutta.

Dutta, who founded CARE, the Center for Culture-Centered Approach to Research and Evaluation, at the National University of Singapore in 2012, with a focus on marginalized communities, has just published a paper on migrant workers in Singapore during this pandemic.

He says many of them told him they are concerned about whether they'll get paid during the lockdown (Singapore's Ministry of Manpower insists they will) and about the overcrowding and lack of sanitation facilities in the dormitories.

Dutta says that in many dormitories, 100 workers share a block of five toilets and five shower stalls.

""There is this sense of panic and fear, and part of that is related to this sense of not being able to move outside of the room,"" he says. ""Everyone is pretty much stuck in the room at such close proximity.""

Singapore's Health Ministry has moved aggressively to try to address the coronavirus outbreaks in the housing blocks. The government is trying to find alternative accommodations for people in the hardest-hit dorms, but Dutta says it's impossible to come up with safe, short-term lodging for more than 300,000 workers.

But he does believe there could be long-term changes that would help the workers. And Dutta hopes this outbreak will force Singapore to examine how it treats this often overlooked population, bringing major changes in how foreign workers are housed and treated.

Meanwhile, the explosion of cases in Singapore over the last three weeks has remained primarily among foreign workers. For example, on May 1 there were 11 new cases reported among Singapore's permanent residents and 905 new infections among the workers residing in the dorms.

Michael Merson, the head of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Global Health Institute in Singapore, says it's unlikely the outbreaks in the dormitories will spill over to the rest of the city.

""There's very little mixing between the foreign workers and the rest of the population,"" Merson says. He's confident that Singapore's health officials will be able to isolate the infected workers and give them, in his words, ""the best medical care possible.""

Nonetheless, the Singaporean government has extended the lockdown for the entire city-state until at least June 1.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/05/03/849135036/singapore-was-a-shining-star-in-covid-control-until-it-wasnt

I nearly lost it when the number dropped from 50 to 10.

My mother's church pastor tried to be steady and consoling, but I could hear the emotion at the edges of his voice. His news: Instead of the 50 mourners we hoped to host, just 10 people would be allowed to attend her funeral on March 28, courtesy of the latest social distancing requirements laid down by state and local officials. Including church staff.

It was unthinkable. My mother, Carolyn Jean Williams — who had spent 60 years singing in the choir at St. Timothy Community Church in Gary, Ind., who had logged nearly 50 years as a teacher in Gary's school system, and who had lived in that crumbling steel town since before The Beatles came to America — would not get the public outpouring of love from the places to which she had given most of her life.

The consequences struck me instantly. Remembering my mother now, what stands out is how much she loved music and singing, her church, her friends in the choir, her sorority and me. But so much of that would be stripped away from the bare-bones service we were now allowed to present.

The Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority has a ceremony for their beloved members who have transitioned, called ""Ivy Beyond the Wall""; couldn't happen. The church choir has a tradition for how to celebrate the passing of a valued member; wasn't possible.

After a funeral, attendees usually gather elsewhere in the church for a meal called the repast, which normally feeds hundreds of people. For my mother, the church would prepare food to go that we had to take somewhere else, gathering privately in a close-knit group, like criminals convening in a secret hideout.

Four days before she died of respiratory failure unrelated to COVID-19, I was forced to leave my mother's hospital bedside, thanks to new visitor restrictions. Now, with this latest news, it felt like we had once again become collateral damage in the war against coronavirus.

This is what happens when a pandemic strikes and institutions that should have spent years preparing are instead making policies, seemingly, on the fly. It's like trying to change a tire while the car is still moving.

Families like mine are forced into situations that are more horrific than they would be otherwise. And, while you struggle to cope with each new disappointment, a question rises in the back of your mind:

""Couldn't someone have found a better way?""

Already, the pandemic had taken so much.

My mother landed in the hospital after a fall in her apartment; weakened by a just-finished round of chemotherapy and two infections she didn't know she had. She lay on the floor for hours. The next day, I was by her side, logging 20-hour stints caring for her, until days later, a nurse told me I had to leave.

It was a surprise because, frankly, I had been helping a lot. When my mother was left in a drafty holding area after being sedated for a bone marrow biopsy, I asked someone to get her out before she got sicker. I eventually learned how to turn off the alarms which would sound when her intravenous line would get kinked up, because the nurses could take long minutes to answer and the noise was maddening.

But the hospital's visitation policies had been tightening for days, as the nation began to grapple with the pandemic in mid-March. And like a frog sitting in a pot of slowly heating water, I had barely noticed.

A security guard broke up a prayer session involving my mom, her pastor and three friends, because the hospital had begun banning groups of visitors. Over the next couple of days, only one guest was allowed in the room at a time, requiring me to leave whenever someone else came in.

Then, with little warning, I was told to leave, too. Everyone was apologetic. A beefy security guard came to deliver the news, talking incessantly about how sorry he was. After a few minutes, I realized his words weren't for me; he was soothing himself by trying to assure me, somehow, that it wasn't personal.

Of course, for us, it was entirely personal.

Just that morning, my mother had shown more energy than I'd seen in days, joking wearily with the nurses and doctors, who by then had become an endless procession of people poking and examining her. Now, she was pleading with them and the guard, tears welling in her eyes, as I assured her that I'd call soon and I'd be back before long. I was afraid, too; worried that the tiny bit of hope I'd seen would be snuffed out by this latest indignity.

I know all the reasons why the hospital made its decisions. I heard rumors they were caring for patients who had the COVID-19 virus, and they were rightfully worried about infection spread.

But there was also a constant sense the hospital was making decisions in the moment that could change from day-to-day. Visitors and patients had no idea what might come next and little confidence that any changes came from following a careful plan.

As I sat in my mother's home, urging friends from church who worked at the hospital to look in on her, I wondered about all the seriously ill patients not yet at death's door, now deprived of the soothing, inspirational presence of those they love most. How many more might recover, if they had a loved one by their side while fighting for life?

Even in my mother's final hours, odd things happened. The doctor who talked with me about moving her to hospice care – he was essentially telling me she was going to die — kept trying to shake my hand. I had to remind him, thanks to the current coronavirus guidelines, we were not allowed to touch in that way. Twice.

Finally, the hospital relented and allowed me to see her again. I knew it was because she didn't have much time; I raced to be by her side, and about 14 hours later, at 10:02 p.m. on March 22, she was gone.

I looked at her lifeless body, unable to fully process what happened. And before I left her hospital room, a troubling thought surfaced:

Was a funeral even possible?

As I tried to plan, it felt like she was being victimized again — robbed of the public outpouring of grief, love and respect she had earned through 81 years of life, much of it spent in the service of others.

We managed to pull together a wonderful service at St. Timothy. My mother's friends, who were also choir members, were among the 10 allowed inside and could sing my mother's favorite songs. The choir director, who had joined the church not long after my mother did nearly 60 years ago, provided recordings of her soaring solos during spirituals like ""God Is...""

A projector screen at the back of the sanctuary played a slideshow of photos from her life. And there were heartfelt eulogies from her friends, her pastor and me.

But I, Carolyn Williams' only child, was the only blood relative in the cavernous sanctuary – a space that could have held hundreds of mourners. (backed by my mother's friends, her sister-in-law and my wonderful girlfriend, who lives in Wisconsin and drove five hours to reach my mother's Indiana home.)

During a visitation before the funeral, one mourner, a fellow teacher and choir member who had known my mother for longer than I have been alive, just stood in front of me, feet of space between us, shaking with emotion as tears rose in his eyes. We needed desperately to hug each other and let the sorrow pass between us. But all we could do is stare and tremble.

The newspaper obituary and my social media posts had told people to connect with the church's website, where the service would be streamed online. But as we were leaving the church for the burial site, I passed the volunteer in charge of the technology; I could hear the sounds of a customer service operator coming from his cellphone.

That's not a good sign, I thought.

Sure enough, Comcast had a service outage about 20 minutes into the ceremony. Friends across the country told me later, the feed cut out mysteriously during my mom's first song. Fortunately, the church posted video of the entire service on YouTube, which you can see here.

Of course, there are so many who have experienced so much worse. Families have lost multiple people to the virus. Healthcare workers who only wanted to treat the sick have become sick themselves, and some have lost their lives. These shelter-in-place restrictions are key to slowing the spread of a global pandemic.

And, as frustrating as some of my own experiences have been, I am also very thankful.

Thankful that I had a job where I could leave with just a few hours' notice, with no idea when I might come back. Thankful that my mother wasn't suffering for long weeks or months in a hospital bed, unable to take care of herself: a fate she feared most. Thankful that she or I hadn't contracted coronavirus when the visitation rules were more lax and the words ""shelter at home"" weren't quite part of our common lexicon.

But I'll be even more grateful when most hospitals allow at least one highly monitored visitor for seriously sick patients without COVID-19 – so that at least some people, unlucky enough to fall gravely ill during the Age of Coronavirus, don't have to face death largely alone, surrounded by strangers.

Because, as much as a FaceTime call or ceremony livestream can connect those separated by social distancing and stay-at-home orders, they are a meager substitute for the healing which comes from one person holding another, providing strength and sharing love when it is needed most.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/03/844806361/when-a-beloved-life-ends-virtual-hugs-cant-replace-human-touch

Updated at 5 p.m. ET, April 20

As COVID-19 surges in places throughout the country, Americans are left to wonder, ""When will my state hit its worst point?""

A widely cited model offers some predictions. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's COVID-19 projections were cited in recent White House briefings and take into account how the pandemic is playing out in several countries around the world. They incorporate the current trend line of deaths in U.S. states and the estimated impact of social distancing measures to predict when each state might reach peak daily deaths and hospital usage.

While projections like these are imprecise, they're useful to policymakers and hospital leaders trying to prepare for surges. The model was designed to give hospitals an idea of how quickly they need to expand capacity and by how much.

Researchers at IHME make frequent updates to the model based on newly available data. As of the newest update, released Friday, the modelers project that U.S. deaths peaked Friday. Some earlier updates have resulted in significant shifts. For instance, a recent major update, made April 5, showed fewer people dying over a shorter period of time than originally predicted, the model's lead researcher Chris Murray says.

However, he cautioned that when social distancing measures lift, outbreaks could spark up again.

""If you ease up prematurely the epidemic can rebound right back to the level we are at now in a matter of weeks,"" Murray says. ""So the potential for rebound is enormous if we let up on social distancing.""

To compare states with vast differences in populations, NPR analyzed the projections by looking at deaths per 100,000 residents.

Understanding the projected range

It's important to note that much uncertainty comes with modeling into the future. The national model had a huge range between its low and high estimates for peak daily deaths, which it now says came to pass on April 15. But individual states have large gaps, too. The model, for example, estimated New York's daily deaths could range between 147 and 2678 at its peak, which it estimates the state reached April 16.

Loading...

In these models, the peak projects the date when a state's curve stops increasing and begins a consistent trend downward. Sometimes that's not the date of the current highest recorded number of daily deaths.

Murray acknowledged the challenge that the wide range of uncertainty poses to decision-makers at a press conference Monday announcing updates. He advised hospitals to hope for the best-case scenarios — but to prepare for the worst.

""In places where there's a rapidly rising epidemic — New York, New Jersey, now other places — the ability to predict that exact peak is not as accurate as we previously said,"" Murray said. ""Resource planners should pay attention to the upper bound so we're not caught off guard.""

New York had surpassed 18,000 COVID-19 deaths as of Monday. It is expected to be the hardest hit state, in terms of raw numbers. The model projects between 14,000 and 43,000 total deaths in the state by Aug. 4, and projected that daily deaths peaked April 16. That amounts to between 77 and 221 deaths for every 100,000 New Yorkers, putting New York among the worst hit states per capita as well.

The model also looks at hospital bed shortages. It projects a potential shortfall in New York, culminating this week. The state was projected to reach peak resource use on April 15, when it would need between 7,000 and 43,000 beds. Under normal circumstances there are only 13,000 beds available in the state, according to the modelers. (This does not take into account ongoing efforts to expand bed capacity.)

The effects of social distancing

The model projects California will see fewer deaths than New York, despite having twice as many people living in the state. That gives California a much lower death rate relative to its number of residents.

Loading...

The difference reflects social distancing measures California took, says Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at IHME who helped create the model.

""California started social distancing before New York. [Californians] had one week ahead of them in order to deal with the problem and took the right measures,"" Mokdad says. ""And we're seeing the benefit.""

The model makes some key assumptions about how state leaders will act — and depending on what they do, the picture could change. First, it assumes that all states will continue social distancing through the end of May, which is longer than the White House has asked Americans to practice social distancing. Second, it assumes states that have not already implemented three key social distancing measures — closing schools, closing nonessential businesses and issuing stay-at-home orders — will do so in one week.

This second assumption is particularly important for a state like Massachusetts, which has closed nonessential businesses and schools, but has not ordered residents to stay at home. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker has resisted calls to mandate a stay-at-home order, though he has enacted a voluntary stay-at-home advisory. ""I do not believe I can or should order U.S. citizens to keep confined to their homes for days on end,"" Baker said last month.

Loading...

The model's highest projections could spell tragedy for Massachusetts, estimating daily death tolls at the upper bounds nearly on par with what New York has experienced so far. The average figure it forecasts would still be devastating for a state of its size — the state was projected to hit peak daily deaths April 20 with 135 deaths that day.

Through social distancing, Mokdad says, communities and individuals can still make a difference in how bad things will get.

""We're modeling [based on] your deck of cards right now,"" he says. ""If you change the deck of cards, it's going to be totally different. If people do a better job, it's going to go down. If they don't — if they ignore recommendations and start partying and going out — then they will have more mortality.""

A final important note about this model: The data show the day each state may reach its worst day for deaths between now and the beginning of August. It does not reflect surges that could happen after that.

You can view your own state's peak and projected totals below, or see how all states compare.

Note: This projection is current as of April 20, at 5 p.m. ET, and will be updated periodically as the modelers input new data. The visualization shows the day each state may reach its peak between now and Aug. 4. The projected peak is when a state's curve begins to show a consistent trend downward.

Since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the United States on Jan. 21, over one million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of COVID-19. On April 12, the U.S. became the nation with the most deaths globally, but there are early signs that the U.S. case and death counts may be leveling off, as the growth of new cases and deaths plateaus. The pattern isn't consistent across the country, as new hot spots emerge and others subside.

In response to mounting cases, state and federal authorities have emphasized a social distancing strategy, widely seen as the best available means to slow the spread of the virus. Most states have put in place measures such as closing schools and nonessential businesses and ordering citizens to stay home as much as possible.

It's not clear how long such measures need to be in place to see a lasting effect. In Wuhan, the city in China where the virus originated, a strictly enforced lockdown and widespread testing have slowed the outbreak dramatically, enough to bring an end to the 76-day lockdown.

A large portion of U.S. cases are centered on New York City. Since March 20, New York state, Connecticut and New Jersey have accounted for around 50% of all U.S. cases. As of April 9, nearly 60% of all deaths from COVID-19 have been in these three states. While New York state appears to be reaching a plateau, as seen below, it notched between 8,000 and 10,000 new cases each day between March 31 and April 12.

To understand how one state's outbreak compares with another's, it's helpful to look at not just the daily counts but the rate of change day over day. In the following chart, we display cases on a logarithmic scale, meaning that every axis line is 10 times greater than the previous one. This type of scale emphasizes the rate of change.

When case counts grow very quickly, a state's curve trends sharply upward, as New York's does over the first 15 days past 100 cases. Generally, this is evidence of unbridled community transmission of the disease. As new cases slow, the curve bends toward horizontal, showing that the state's outbreak may be leveling off. This doesn't mean the number of cases has stopped growing, but the rate of growth has slowed, which could signify that social distancing measures are having an effect.

Loading...

In some areas, there are signs of hope. The areas with the earliest outbreaks — such as California and Washington — seem to be having success at suppressing the disease. The outlook in Washington has improved to the point that the state has returned unused Army hospital beds it had received in preparation for a peak in cases.

Elsewhere, limited access to testing may make the number of cases look smaller than it really is. As testing becomes more readily available, we are likely to see the number of confirmed cases continue to grow, even if not at the pace previously seen.

Since the new coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December, the infectious respiratory disease COVID-19 has spread rapidly within China and to neighboring countries and beyond.

The first confirmed coronavirus cases outside China occurred on Jan. 20, in Japan, Thailand and South Korea. On Jan. 21, the first case in the U.S. was identified in Washington state.

On Jan. 24, the first two European cases were confirmed in France. By Feb. 1, eight European nations had confirmed cases of COVID-19, and a month later that count had risen to 24 countries with at least 2,200 cases, most of them in Italy. On March 11, Italy eclipsed 10,000 cases and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic — the first since H1N1 in 2009. That's also when China, the original epicenter, began seeing drops in daily counts of new cases.

March also saw exponential spread of the virus throughout the U.S., with all 50 states reporting cases by March 17.

Every U.S. state has implemented restrictions designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Businesses reduced or ceased operations, people transitioned into working and learning remotely, and nonessential activities were paused. At least temporarily, much of the country was under strict orders to stay home.

State officials are now charting paths to a new normal, seeking a balance between reopening economies and protecting public health. Many governors are outlining new frameworks and timelines for their states. Some have also formed regional partnerships to coordinate economic recovery.

President Trump's federal guidelines for social distancing and mitigation expired on May 1. Many states are extending stay-at-home orders, prolonging school closures or delaying elections until after that date. Others are lifting restrictions and entering the first phases of their recovery plans. While conditions and predictions differ across states, there is broad consensus that reopening will not happen overnight.

Each day brings changes. NPR is tracking developments in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia so you can see what's changed and how states compare.

The coordinator for White House coronavirus response efforts says it is ""devastatingly worrisome"" to see crowds of demonstrators protesting stay-at-home orders while also refusing to follow social distancing guidelines or wear masks.

Asked about demonstrations last week where crowds swarmed Michigan's capitol building — some, brandishing firearms — Dr. Deborah Birx told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace that protesters may inadvertently jeopardize the health and lives of their family members.

""It's devastatingly worrisome to me personally because if they go home and infect their grandmother or their grandfather who has a co-morbid condition and they have a serious or a very — or an unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives,"" said Birx.

Thursday's protests in Michigan followed the decision by the state's governor, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, to extend stay-at-home orders, even as some states have begun the process of re-opening their economies.

Birx said regardless of where states are in their response to the virus, Americans should continue observing the recommendations of public health officials.

""We also made it very clear to the American people, this is what you need to continue to do to protect yourself. You need to continue to social distance. You need to continue to practice scrupulous handwashing,"" Birx said.

In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, issued an executive order to allow restaurants and retail shops in most of the state to re-open Monday — albeit at limited capacity and with social distancing measures.

In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has allowed stores, restaurants and movie theaters to re-open, though in the six days since that order was announced Dallas County has twice seen its daily tally of new coronavirus cases hit a new high.

Georgia has allowed tattoo parlors, gyms and barber shops to reopen. On barber shops in particular, Birx said that even with masks, it was still not advisable to get a professional trim.

""It's safer but we've made it clear that that is not a good phase 1 activity,"" Birx said referring to the phased re-opening guidance by the White House for states.

Other states which have been slower to re-open have seen protests, with recent demonstrations in several states including Oregon, Wisconsin and California, where hundreds amassed in Huntington Beach on Friday to protest state-mandated beach closures.

Wallace also asked Birx about statements by President Trump that projections for how many Americans would die from the coronavirus have dropped drastically. Early projections put the expected number of deaths between 100,000 and 240,000, but late last month the president put the number lower, saying, ""we're going toward 50- or 60,000 people.""

Birx maintained that original projections ""have always been between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives lost, and that's with full mitigation and us learning from each other of how to social distance.""

As of Sunday, more than 67,000 deaths have been recorded in the U.S.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/03/849786763/birx-on-stay-at-home-protests-devastatingly-worrisome

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened up about his nearly two-week long battle with coronavirus on Sunday, revealing that at points during his ICU stay doctors were making arrangements for ""what to do if things went badly wrong.""

""It was a tough old moment, I won't deny it,"" the 55-year-old said in an interview with the British newspaper, The Sun, ""They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin-type' scenario.""

Johnson spent three nights in the ICU at St Thomas' Hospital in London, where he said medical workers gave him ""liters and liters of oxygen.""

During that time he said, his health indicators were headed in the wrong direction.

""It was hard to believe that in just a few days my health had deteriorated to this extent,"" Johnson said, ""I remember feeling frustrated. I couldn't understand why I wasn't getting better.""

""But the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe,"" Johnson said, which would've forced him to go into a medically induced coma.

The prime minister attributed his recovery to United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) doctors and nurses. Johnson and his fiancée Carrie Symonds, named their newborn son,Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, in honor of two physicians, Dr. Nick Price and Dr. Nick Hart, whom the prime minister credited with saving his life.

The acknowledgment comes as NHS doctors have called out for more PPE and better pay.

Johnson said he wants to prevent people from suffering like he did, but that he is driven by a desire to get the U.K. ""back on its feet.""

The country has suffered more than 28,000 deaths due to the virus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. And, at least 183,500 people in the U.K. have tested positive for COVID-19.

But the country is past the peak of its coronavirus outbreak, the prime minister said.

With restaurants closed in Belgium until at least June 8 due to the country's COVID-19 lockdown, piles of potatoes that would have been deep-fried and topped with a glop of mayo have nowhere to go.

Some 750,000 tons of spuds intended for the free market which remain unsold — or those under contract but unable to be processed due to the glut — will only remain edible until the end of June. Meanwhile, the price for such potatoes has plummeted.

The head of Belgium's potato-processing association, Belgapom, says the solution is beautifully simple: Eat more frites!

Romain Cools points to statistics showing Belgian households typically eat one serving of fries per week and suggests one more won't hurt consumers and will really help producers.

""It will not damage your health if you leave something else a little bit greasy out of your meal,"" Cools counsels. That will free up space in freezers, he says, all the way from large factories to supermarkets to home kitchens, and allow more of the potatoes now harvested — and at risk of rot — to go into processing.

Cools came up with the campaign to eat twice as many fries as he was giving an interview about the crisis in the industry last month. The attention it's received from around the world has surprised and amused him. He's pleased his advice seems to have spread widely, since Belgium is, by volume, the world's largest exporter of frozen potato products. The processed potato industry is worth more than $2 billion annually in that country alone.

Potato producers aren't only asking for help; they're also giving it. In a new partnership between regional authorities and one industry leader, Pomuni, 25 tons of potatoes are being donated per week to area food banks to help make up for a COVID-related drop in donations.

Cools says Belgapom, which includes all Belgian processors, will team up with supermarkets in the coming weeks to get even more fries out of the freezers.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/03/848214754/belgians-urged-to-eat-more-fries-to-help-potato-farmers-amid-pandemic-related-gl

Months into the spread of the novel coronavirus in the United States, widespread diagnostic testing still isn't available. California offers a sobering view of the dysfunction blocking the way nationally.

It's hard to overstate how uneven the access to critical test kits remains in the nation's largest state. Even as some Southern California counties are opening drive-through sites to make testing available to any resident who wants it, a rural northern county is testing raw sewage to determine whether the coronavirus has infiltrated its communities.

County to county, city to city — even hospital to hospital within a city — testing capacity varies widely, as does the definition of who qualifies for testing.

Testing deserts, stemming from an overwhelmed supply chain and a disjointed public health system, have hit hardest in California's rural north and in lower-income urban neighborhoods with concentrations of residents who already were struggling to get quality medical care, long before the pandemic.

In the absence of a coordinated federal response, local health departments, hospitals and commercial labs across the state have been competing for the same scarce materials. Whether they are ""haves"" — or have-nots — is determined largely by how deep their pockets are, their connections to suppliers and how the state is allocating emergency supplies.

Compounding these problems is the lack of a state or federal public health infrastructure empowered to acquire and allocate resources on a grand and equitable scale. Hospitals and health systems where many people go for care are, by design, set up to focus resources on their own patients and workers. Their bureaucracies can't readily adapt to do the community outreach and education that could bring testing to the masses; nor are they set up to do the contact tracing that ensures that people who have been exposed to COVID-19 patients are tested and monitored.

Those roles typically fall to county health departments, which in much of California operate on bare-bones budgets that make it a struggle to contain perennial STD outbreaks, let alone a deadly pandemic.

Over the past two months, the state has triaged one testing disaster after another, but it is finally making headway on making tests more widely available, in part by cutting its own deals for supplies and expanding testing sites in underserved areas, said Dr. Bob Kocher, one of three people on a testing task force convened by California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

But conversations with dozens of local health officials, hospital systems, scientists and elected officials reveal just how complicated a task it will be.

Take Lake County, a recreational mecca just over two hours north of San Francisco. With 65,000 residents, it has had so few testing supplies that officials have resorted to buying swabs on Amazon and pilfering chlamydia testing kits for swabs and the liquid used to transport specimens to labs. Through what the county has cobbled together, it has identified six cases of COVID-19, all found via nurses or volunteers who have gone out looking for patients.

""We're basically having to do tea leaves to figure out what's going on,"" said Dr. Gary Pace, the county's health officer.

Pace knows the county has community transmission, both from the cases they've identified and because they've started running tests on raw sewage to check for the COVID-19 virus; samples from four treatment plants have come back positive. ""It is a way to just get more information because we can't do testing,"" he said. Unlike the diagnostic kits — which make use of supplies every health department in the country is competing for — the sewage sampling is done pro bono by a technology startup.

While announcing an ambitious program to increase testing last week, Newsom highlighted the rural-urban divide. ""One of the big struggles we have had in the last few weeks of this pandemic is getting to rural and remote parts of this state and getting up testing sites and making them available,"" he said.

Newsom is promising to dramatically increase the level of coronavirus testing, with a focus on rural towns and communities of color. California currently tests about 25,000 people a day but has a strategy to raise that to 60,000 to 80,000 per day.

The state has opened the first of 86 pop-up testing sites targeted for areas in need. It is launching a program to train 10,000 workers to serve as temporary disease investigators who can do the contact tracing considered fundamental in stemming the spread of the virus.

Pace said he wrote the governor to ask for one of the pop-up sites. ""Statewide, there's a situation where there's not enough testing, and if you're trying to demonstrate progress, the way you do that is numbers,"" he said. ""We are interested in equity, though, and in my view, we need some horizontal coverage instead of just lots of numbers.""

In Mendocino County, situated along California's rugged North Coast, officials expressed similar frustration. In late April, a health center on the Round Valley Indian Reservation got a rapid test machine made by Abbott Laboratories, distributed via the Indian Health Service. That same day, a tribal member came in feeling sick. That person tested positive for COVID-19, as did five family members. The county previously had identified just five cases, all linked to travel.

Dr. Noemi Doohan, the Mendocino County public health officer, fears a broader outbreak among the six tribes who live on the reservation. The state since has provided 2,000 test kits for people who live or work around the reservation. Doohan's office will have to hire couriers to drive 2½ hours to a public lab in nearby Sonoma County, which also has limited supplies, to get the tests processed.

It's every lab — and county — for itself

A mix of commercial and public labs are responsible for testing in California, and supply chain limitations have plagued them all. But those with deeper pockets and stronger commercial relationships have been out-competing counties and public labs with limited resources.

Rural Tulare County, spanning the peaks and foothills of the Sierra Nevada, is home to half a million people. It also has one of the highest per capita death counts of COVID-19 in California. Until recently, the local public lab was the only place in the county that could test for the disease. After borrowing staff from another county, buying additional machines, and suspending testing for most other diseases, they are now able to process 85 tests a day. Officials also can send specimens to commercial labs in other parts of the state, but say days-long turnarounds create bottlenecks for tracking patients and finding contacts.

Monterey County, in the heart of the state's ""salad bowl"" coastal farming region, has relied on donations — and horse-trading — to meet demand. A local hospital found the expensive materials needed to make a missing reagent and mixed a batch for the public lab, said lab director Donna Ferguson. The hospital also gave the county 1,000 swabs, which Ferguson used to barter with Riverside County for extraction kits.

And through the kindness of strangers, she found a stopgap for limits on another important resource: lab workers.

During an interview with a local public radio station in March, Ferguson mused that if one of the three microbiologists working in her lab got sick, it could be disastrous for the county's ability to process tests. The next day, she got a call from a graduate student at Stanford's nearby Hopkins Marine Station. He'd heard the interview. Could he and his colleagues help? The crew of six graduate students from three universities has been volunteering at the lab since, tripling its capacity to 120 tests a day.

Though the supply chain is a concern for labs of all sizes, manufacturers appear to be prioritizing orders from commercial labs and big health systems over public health labs, said Eric Blanks, chief program officer for the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which represents most of the labs run by public health departments in the nation.

Quest Diagnostics, the medical testing giant headquartered in New Jersey, is running 350,000 coronavirus tests a week in its facilities around the nation. But it is being inundated with samples from across the country, and even as it has worked to ease backlogs, counties and private hospitals are waiting days for results.

Kaiser Permanente says it can test 2,000 to 2,500 people throughout the state each week. Sutter Health, a major provider in Northern California, tests around 650 people each day across its hospitals. CommonSpirit Health, which includes Dignity Health hospitals, says it could process 50,000 samples a week if it had to. As of last week, Stanford had run more than 20,000 tests for Bay Area residents.

But even the giants don't have unlimited supplies. ""It really is the manufacturing lines. They're the ones that right now are the limiting factor,"" said Karen Smith, system vice president of laboratory services at CommonSpirit Health.

Moreover, hospitals are not set up to solve the broader issue of statewide disparities in access. They can generally handle the patients sick enough to seek out their ERs. But it hasn't historically been their role to arrange community-wide supplies and testing.

""You're not going to go to an emergency room if you're asymptomatic. That's the last place in the world you want to be right now,"" said Dr. Omid Bakhtar, medical director for outreach laboratory services at Sharp HealthCare in San Diego. ""It's frustrating for me. I have the ability to do more [specimens], but how do I get them?""

Tests but no takers

In pockets around the state, some counties have been able to stabilize their flow of supplies, in some cases because they have more financial means, in others because of their relationships with major hospital systems and research institutions.

With more confidence in their supply chains, Los Angeles and Riverside counties say they are ready to offer testing to any resident. Several other counties, including much of the Bay Area, are asking more people — including workers deemed essential who don't have COVID symptoms — to get tested.

But some counties that have managed to ramp up testing are wrestling with yet another problem: not enough people to test. The reasons are twofold. After weeks of being told they shouldn't go for testing because of shortages, the public seems to be adhering to that message even now that more testing is available. And the public health workforce tasked with locating those in need of testing is depleted.

San Francisco can test 4,300 people each day in its publicly supported labs but was receiving just 500 samples a day as of late April. Los Angeles is testing roughly 10,000 people daily but says it needs to double that to lift the shelter-in-place orders. Its focus in coming weeks is to increase testing among the uninsured and those in at-risk living environments such as homeless encampments and skilled nursing facilities.

Health officials say part of the challenge is they aren't getting the word out to poorer residents and communities of color, even as those same groups are being hit harder by the virus in many cities. In San Francisco, for example, Latino residents make up 16% of the population but 25% of COVID-19 cases. In Los Angeles, black people are 9% of the county's population but represent 15% of the deaths from COVID-19 for which race and ethnicity data is available.

Kocher, of the state testing task force, acknowledged the state has more work to do. But, he argued, there's also a sufficient amount of testing capability available today, especially via high-capacity commercial labs where the state says the vast majority of specimens should be processed.

""Right now, we're concerned with not having enough samples collected,"" he said.

When officials do slowly begin to let people return to work and school, experts agree that cases will go up, creating even more need for labs, testing and contact tracers. Preparing for that future will require even more resources.

""We need money,"" said Santa Barbara County Health Officer Dr. Henning Ansorg. ""Lots of money. Lots and lots of it.""

Updated Sunday at 6:59 p.m. ET

President Trump is moving to replace the Department of Health and Human Services watchdog whose office found severe shortages of medical supplies in hospitals as COVID-19 cases surged.

In a Friday night announcement, the White House named Jason Weida as its nominee to take the permanent inspector general post currently occupied by Christi Grimm, who's been in that role in an acting capacity since January.

A longtime staffer with Health and Human Services, Grimm was leading the inspector general's office in April when it issued a report chronicling testing delays — up to seven days in some cases — as well as severe shortages of supplies in hospitals amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Hospitals reported that they were unable to keep up with COVID-19 testing demands because they lacked complete kits and/or the individual components and supplies needed to complete tests,"" the survey of 323 hospitals found. ""When patient stays were extended while awaiting test results, this strained bed availability, personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies, and staffing.""

The report also recalled how one hospital had even resorted to making its own disinfectant.

Trump reacted to the report by calling its findings ""wrong,"" asking to know the name of the inspector general and suggesting the report was politically motivated. He later took to Twitter to castigate Grimm and the report even further.

""Why didn't the I.G., who spent 8 years with the Obama Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the Admirals, Generals, V.P. & others in charge, before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier!"" Trump tweeted in early April.

Grimm is a career official, not a political appointee, and began serving in the Office of the Inspector General in 1999.

The nomination of Weida — currently an assistant U.S. attorney — marks the latest replacement of a high-level watchdog by the president. A month ago, he fired the inspector general who raised concerns that eventually led to his impeachment. Days later, he removed the inspector general charged with overseeing the government's coronavirus response bill.

Washington Sen. Patty Murray, ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said that Trump's nominee ""must not get through the Senate without ironclad commitments"" to continue the agency's current investigations without political interference.

""We all know the President hasn't told people the truth about this virus or his Administration's response, and late last night, he moved to silence an independent government official who did,"" Murray said in a statement released on Saturday. ""Anyone who demands less will be complicit in the President's clear pattern of retaliation against those who tell the truth.""

Health and Human Services did not comment to NPR on Grimm's future role, but said in a statement that the agency had been preparing ""to assist a new Inspector General appointee over a year ago, when the previous presidentially-appointed and senate-confirmed Inspector General first announced his intention to retire from government service. We will continue to work conscientiously to support a smooth leadership transition.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/02/849642036/trump-moves-to-replace-watchdog-who-reported-medical-shortages

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a rare joint statement on Saturday, declined an offer from the White House to make rapid COVID-19 tests available for Congress.

""Congress is grateful for the Administration's generous offer to deploy rapid COVID-19 testing capabilities to Capitol Hill, but we respectfully decline the offer at this time,"" Pelosi and McConnell said. ""Our country's testing capacities are continuing to scale up nationwide and Congress wants to keep directing resources to the front-line facilities where they can do the most good the most quickly.""

McConnell, R-Ky., plans to bring the Senate back into session on Monday, while Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said this week the House would not bring representatives back over coronavirus fears.

On Friday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Twitter that the Trump administration would send three Abbott ""point of care testing machines and 1,000 tests for their use"" to Capitol Hill.

President Trump on Saturday tweeted: ""No reason to turn it down, except politics. We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new Doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work!""

Pelosi and Hoyer said they made the decision based on advice from the Capitol's attending physician, Brian Monahan. ""The House physician's view was that there was a risk to members that was one he would not recommend taking,"" Hoyer said Tuesday.

So far, Rand Paul of Kentucky is the only senator to have tested positive for the coronavirus. In the House, seven members have tested positive or have been presumed to be positive for the coronavirus.

On Friday, McConnell shared guidelines from Monahan urging lawmakers and staff to maintain 6 feet of distance, limit the number of people in offices, and wear masks when possible.

Monahan has told Republican leaders that his office does not have the capacity to proactively test all 100 senators and can only test those who are ill, Politico reported.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/02/849638799/pelosi-and-mcconnell-decline-white-house-offer-of-coronavirus-tests-for-capitol-

Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images

President Trump twice received intelligence briefings on the coronavirus in January, according to a White House official. The official tells NPR the briefings occurred on Jan. 23 and Jan. 28.

""The president was told that the coronavirus was potentially going to 'spread globally,' "" the official said of the first briefing, which came two days after the first case of the virus was reported in the United States. ""But the 'good news' was that it was not deadly for most people,"" the official said the president was told.

Five days after that initial briefing, the president was briefed again, according to the official. This time, he was told the virus ""was spreading outside of China, but that deaths from the disease were happening only in China,"" the official said. ""He was also told that China was withholding data.""

The question of what Trump knew about the coronavirus, when he was aware of it and the tenor of those conversations have come under heavy scrutiny, as the administration faces criticism that it was slow to respond to early warnings about the virus. In the time since the president's January briefings, the U.S. has reported more than 1.1 million cases of the coronavirus — more than any other nation. In all, more than 66,000 Americans have died.

The president has defended his handling of the crisis — pointing to steps like his decision at the end of January to restrict travel into the U.S. from China. But for much of the following month, the president and some of his top surrogates downplayed the threat of the virus.

""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,"" the president said in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News early in February. By the end of the month, with the virus reported in several dozen countries at that point, he continued to tell reporters that the risk ""remains very low.""

During his State of the Union address, roughly a week after being told that China was withholding data, Trump said his administration was ""coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak.""

To this point, the White House has offered little clarity publicly about the exact dates when Trump was briefed about the virus. Asked about this on Thursday, Trump told reporters that he spoke with intelligence officials about the coronavirus ""in January, later January,"" adding that intelligence officials had confirmed that this was the case.

On Monday, when The Washington Post reported that Trump received more than a dozen classified briefings in January and February, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence responded, ""The detail of this is not true,"" and declined to elaborate.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/02/849619486/trump-received-intelligence-briefings-on-coronavirus-twice-in-january

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP

Sen. Mitt Romney is proposing a way for workers in front-line and essential jobs to get a temporary pay bump during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Released on Friday, Patriot Pay is a proposal from the Utah senator and 2012 Republican presidential candidate aimed at providing bonus pay — up to $12 an hour on top of normal wages — for employees in eligible jobs. The increase would extend through May, June and July and would be paid out by employers and the federal government via a payroll tax credit.

Workers in industries designated by Congress and the Department of Labor as essential, including hospitals, grocery stores and health manufacturing, could qualify for the hazard pay, according to a one-page summary of Patriot Pay.

""Health care professionals, grocery store workers, food processors, and many others — the unsung patriots on the frontline of this pandemic — every day risk their safety for the health and well-being of our country, and they deserve our unwavering support,"" Romney said in press release announcing the plan. ""Patriot Pay is a way for us to reward our essential workers as they continue to keep Americans safe, healthy, and fed.""

Romney is not the only lawmaker to propose a form of hazard pay for essential employees.

Last month, Senate Democrats revealed their own proposal — a federal fund offering payments of up to $25,ooo, or $13 an hour and retroactive compensation for qualifying workers dating back to late January, when the public health emergency was first declared.

Their plan also proposes a one-time payment of $15,000 to draw new workers into essential fields.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has also called for some form of hazard pay.

Migrant advocates say more testing must be done in the U.S. and Mexico before deportees are sent back to their home countries.

At least 100 Guatemalans infected with the coronavirus were deported from the U.S. from mid-March through mid-April.

The U.S. suspended deportation flights to Guatemala after 44 migrants tested positive on a flight on April 13.

But this week at least one flight resumed. On Thursday the U.S. deported 89 Guatemalan migrants. All tested negative before boarding, according to Guatemalan officials.

U.S. immigration authorities had previously taken deportees' temperatures and screened for obvious symptoms but until this week had not tested deportees for the coronavirus.

In Mexico, deportations have accelerated in recent weeks. Officials with the Mexican government's National Migration Institute say they have deported more than 3,500 migrants back to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador from their 65 detention centers.

The move was in hopes of stopping the spread of the virus in the centers.

Mexico had been under pressure since March to empty the centers. Migrants had been complaining of overcrowding and dirty conditions for months as fears of the spread of the coronavirus grew. Border closures throughout Central America, in attempts to curb transmission of COVID-19, had complicated deportations.

Officials say there are only about 100 migrants left in the Mexican detention centers that have the capacity to house more than 8,000 people.

Advocates say it is troublesome that Mexico is not testing the migrants before sending them back to their home countries. ""With the deportations, Mexico's Immigration Institute has demonstrated absolute irresponsibility, insensitivity and negligence,"" says Salva La Cruz of the Fray Matías de Cordova Human Rights Center in Tapachula, Chiapas, which is located just miles from the Mexico-Guatemala border.

Others are concerned that continuing deportations without proper testing will put undo strain on the already weak health systems in Central American countries. ""What we're going to be doing is importing this virus in communities that simply cannot afford it once it gets there. The spread will be fast,"" said a U.N. official who would only speak on condition of anonymity. ""You are potentially injecting COVID into a situation which will not be able to manage and will further destabilize these countries,"" added the U.N. official.

In a statement, Mexico's National Migration Institute says that before boarding all buses to be returned to their home countries, migrants are checked out by health professionals and their temperatures are taken. The deportees are also given masks and sanitizing gel for the trip. The statement did not mention testing for COVID-19.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the northern triangle countries of Central America remain in the hundreds. Honduras is battling the biggest outbreak, with at least 899 cases and 75 deaths. El Salvador has about half that number of cases, with 446 confirmed cases and 10 deaths.

Guatemala is dealing with at least 644 cases and 16 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins COVID tracker. Nearly one fifth of the cases there have been traced to deportees from the U.S., according to Guatemalan health officials.

Some deportees are experiencing harassment upon return to their hometowns. In Guatemala, some villages are threatening deportees, fearful that they have brought back the virus, according to Reuters.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/02/849361628/migrant-advocates-call-for-more-testing-before-deportations

At a news conference Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo was not about to understate the scale of the effort to disinfect the New York City subway system.

""This is such a monumental undertaking, I can't even begin to describe it to you,"" Cuomo said during his briefing at a Metropolitan Transportation Authority facility in Queens. ""The New York City subway system has never been closed. It operates 24 hours a day because we have a 24-hour city.""

It will close nevertheless — for cleanup aimed at fighting the spread of the coronavirus, from 1 to 5 a.m. each day beginning Wednesday. Cuomo announced the ""unprecedented step"" on Thursday, which will also include cleanings for buses throughout the public transit system every day. And on Saturday, he made clear the project — which is closing all 472 stations throughout the system for that four-hour spell — will be comprehensive.

""The MTA is going to literally disinfect every train,"" he told reporters. ""It's smart. It's labor-intensive. People have to wear hazmat suits. They have a number of chemicals that disinfect, but literally, you have to go through the whole train with a misting device, with a spray disinfectant literally on every surface.""

New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, has lately seen glimmers of hope — with the number of new infections each day tapering and signs of progress in the number of hospitalizations statewide. The death toll remains ""obnoxiously and terrifyingly high,"" Cuomo said, explaining that at least 299 people across the state died in the past day — a slight uptick over the death toll of 289 reported one day prior.

The stay-at-home order instituted by New York has helped sink subway ridership on the order of 90%. At the same time, the change has exposed the number of people experiencing homelessness who seek refuge in train cars. Passengers will be forced to leave the cars and the stations during the cleaning periods.

""Mental health services, substance abuse [therapy], job training, etc. — we should provide that,"" Cuomo said, casting the operation as an opportunity to connect those in need with the city's services. ""The notion of, 'Well, you should let everyone sleep on the train and just stay on the train, the homeless, because that's good for them' — it's not good for them. We owe them more and we owe them better.""

The governor also pushed back against critics of New York's coronavirus lockdown, some of whom have flouted the state's ban on large gatherings by organizing demonstrations to urge lifting the restrictions.

""I understand the First Amendment: You have an argument, you want to make your argument, God bless America. You want to jeopardize your health, God bless you; you have no right to jeopardize my health,"" he said, noting that he was encouraging law enforcement to enforce an order requiring the use of masks in public across the state.

""I believe it should be enforced because it's reckless, it's irresponsible,"" he added, ""and it's not about your life — it's about other people's lives. And you don't have a right to do that.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/02/849589416/a-monumental-undertaking-nyc-subway-to-disinfect-every-train-each-night

After waiting out a seven-week coronavirus lockdown and some of the strictest social distancing measures in Western Europe, adults in Spain are being allowed out to play at last. On Saturday, six days after Spanish children got the chance to exercise outside, authorities offered their counterparts above the age of 14 the opportunity to do the same for the first time since mid-March.

Many across the country enjoyed a balmy spring day, putting on running shoes, breaking out bicycles or simply slipping on a mask and heading out for a walk after the national government in Madrid lifted its ban on nonessential outdoor activities.

""I have been looking forward to this for weeks. I was joking with my friends that I would be the first out in Madrid,"" one woman out for a jog in Madrid told Reuters on Saturday. ""I am very happy to be out after six weeks of yoga videos.""

Spain has so far suffered one of Europe's worst outbreaks, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, with more than 213,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and a death toll of more than 24,500 linked to COVID-19, as of late Saturday afternoon. In a desperate attempt to slow the spread of the disease, Spanish authorities declared a state of emergency as of March 14, threatening fines of more than $1,000 for anyone who left their home for any activity but those deemed essential, such as visits to the market or pharmacy.

The rules have proven effective, as the number of new cases reported each day in the country has begun to taper and the COVID-19 fatality rate has recently fallen. But they have also chafed at a population increasingly desperate for outdoor activity. By last Sunday, under pressure from parents and pediatricians, authorities had relented on their blanket ban on children under 14 leaving the house. Lawmakers partially lifted the ban as part of legislation extending the state of emergency through May 10.

Now, the freedom to leave one's home for exercise is staggered: Children have from noon to 7 p.m. and adults from 6 to 10 a.m. and 8 to 11 p.m., while vulnerable adults and the elderly have their own hours set aside between those windows.

Spain is just one of several European nations to begin gingerly easing the lockdowns that lowered much across the continent last month. Germany is reopening playgrounds, churches and museums Monday, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson — a recovered COVID-19 patient himself — has said the United Kingdom is ""past the peak"" of its coronavirus outbreak, promising a timeline next week for cautiously reopening the country.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/02/849551597/adults-in-spain-get-a-bit-of-sunshine-as-coronavirus-lockdown-partially-lifts

Gilead Sciences, the drugmaker behind the experimental COVID-19 treatment remdesivir, spent more on lobbying Congress and the administration in the first quarter of 2020 than it ever has before, according to federal filings.

The pharmaceutical company spent $2.45 million on lobbying in the first three months of the year, a 32% increase over the $1.86 million it spent in the first quarter of 2019.

The first quarter is also when Congress drafted and passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which contained numerous provisions affecting the pharmaceutical industry, including funding for the development of vaccines and treatments in response to the pandemic.

Early drafts of the legislation included a provision stipulating that COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and tests be affordable if they were developed with taxpayer funds. But the final bill included additional language that undercut that requirement.

The lobbying spike also coincided with Gilead's ramping up clinical testing of remdesivir, an antiviral drug that has become the most closely watched COVID-19 treatment under development.

On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of remdesivir for patients hospitalized with severe cases of COVID-19. The move would make it easier for patients to receive the intravenous medicine. But the remdesivir supply is limited and Gilead said the U.S. government will coordinate its distribution to hospitals in cities most affected by COVID-19.

The agency's decision came two days after results from two significant remdesivir trials became public.

Loading...

""The data shows that remdisivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery'' from COVID-19, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about a study his institute sponsored. He said the drug would become ""the standard of care.""

The same day, however, a study by Chinese researchers published in The Lancet found remdesivir didn't do better than a placebo when treating seriously ill COVID-19 patients on such measures as survival and time to clinical improvement.

Gilead says its lobbying expenditures increased sharply last quarter because in 2019, the company joined the trade group PhRMA, or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.

A portion of annual membership dues expected to go toward lobbying is typically added to first quarter lobbying disclosures, and this is the first year Gilead is paying dues for the full year, said company spokesman Chris Ridley. He said ""nearly all"" of the additional $590,000 over its first quarter 2019 lobbying went toward PhRMA dues. PhRMA declined to comment on this statement.

PhRMA is considered one of the most influential trade groups on Capitol Hill, sending 183 lobbyists to advocates on the industry's behalf last year as Congress debated drug price bills that eventually stalled, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that tracks campaign finance and lobbying. And the trade group's members spent even more.

""They see dollar signs ahead and they don't want the federal government to get in their way,"" says Ben Wakana, executive director of Patients for Affordable Drugs, an advocacy group. He said that he suspects Gilead is laying the groundwork to push back against congressional attempts to control the prices of COVID-19 drugs.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., says Gilead's track record makes her worry that remdesivir could be priced out of reach if the Food and Drug Administration clears the way for it to be used for COVID-19.

""We have seen one after another of these drugs come on the market, which are fantastic, and except that they end up being out of reach for most consumers,"" she said in an interview with NPR. ""We cannot tolerate as human beings, as Americans, for this to be an opportunity now for price gouging.""

Gilead's pricing of past drugs has drawn criticism. When it launched its hepatitis C cure in 2013, the cost was $1,000 a pill.

And the company is in a legal battle with the federal government over patents for Truvada, an HIV medicine the FDA also approved for use in protecting people at high risk of infection.

Truvada has a list price of more than $22,000 a year, according to GoodRx, a website that helps patients get discounts on drugs. The price has kept many patients from getting access to the drug, patient advocates say. The issue prompted a congressional hearing last year.

Gilead is donating the first 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, but the company has declined to say what remdesivir's price might be after that. During a conference call with investors on Thursday about first quarter earnings, analysts asked Gilead CEO Daniel O'Day whether they could expect similar returns on remdesivir as they've seen with the company's other products.

""There is no rulebook out there, other than that we need to be very thoughtful about how we can make sure we provide access of our medicines to patients around the globe,"" he said on the call. ""And do that in a sustainable way for the company, for ... shareholders, and we acknowledge that.""

Taxpayers helped fund research for remdesivir and other potential vaccines and treatments, so Schakowsky added a line to the CARES Act to make sure drugmakers don't set exorbitant prices.

""The line in the bill essentially said that any drug that was made with any money from taxpayers would have to have reasonable pricing,"" she said. But, she added, a problem arose when another line made its way into the final bill that undercut the pricing assurance. It reads: ""The [Health and Human Services] Secretary shall not take actions that delay the development of such products.""

During a House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing in February, Schakowsky asked Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to promise that coronavirus treatments would be affordable for everyone. He declined, and told her, ""We can't control that price because we need the private sector to invest."" Azar is a former executive of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly & Co.

""It seems to me then that we are in a hostage situation if that's the view of the federal government and the people in charge,"" Schakowsky said. ""If this is what they want to extract from consumers in order to cure it, it's immoral. And it will end in a lot of deaths because people won't be able to afford their drugs.""

Both Gilead and PhRMA declined to say whether they pushed for the CARES Act wording that barred HHS from doing anything that would delay product development.

As for pricing of COVID-19 treatments, the company and the trade group say they're mindful of concerns.

""We've publicly committed that, should remdesivir be proven safe and effective, we are committed to making the medicine both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world,"" Gilead's Ridley wrote in an email.

PhRMA expressed similar sentiments.

""Our industry is working around the clock to develop treatments and vaccines to address the COVID-19 public health crisis and save patients' lives,"" PhRMA spokeswoman Holly Campbell wrote in an email. ""The industry's priority continues to be making sure patients have access to safe, effective and affordable therapies.""

Pharmaceutical and health product lobbying has grown over time, hitting nearly $300 million in 2019, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Spending can also be cyclical, depending on which bills are on the table, says Tim LaPira, an associate political science professor at James Madison University.

Companies may ramp up lobbying to put on a ""charm offensive"" because of ongoing litigation or an upcoming merger, he says.

""It makes sense for a company to temporarily ramp up their lobbying as part of their bigger effort to, you know, quell the backlash,"" LaPira says, adding that lobbying can also help streamline the regulatory process for a new product.

Gilead, AbbVie and Regneron are among the pharmaceutical companies that spent more on lobbying in the first quarter than they ever had in previous quarters, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics compiled for NPR. They all are working on experimental COVID-19 treatments.

AbbVie's HIV drug Kaletra is being studied in COVID-19 patients, and the company spent an additional $90,000 above its previous biggest lobbying quarter, for a total of $2.98 million in the most recent quarter. AbbVie did not respond to NPR's request for comment.

Similar studies are also underway for Regeneron's arthritis drug Kevzara. The company, which is also working on antibody-based treatments, spent $370,000 on lobbying in the first quarter, which is $30,000 higher than the last quarter of 2019, its previous highest quarter.

""Our lobbying spend in Q1'20 increased slightly over the prior quarter due in part to increased interactions with various government agencies around the COVID-19 pandemic and our work to develop a treatment/preventative approach,"" Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie wrote in an email. ""In terms of pricing, we are working hard to beat COVID-19 and make treatments that are affordable and accessible.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/02/849149873/gilead-lobbying-rose-as-interest-in-covid-19-treatment-climbed

As I read news reports this week that health care workers in several states said they don't have enough protective gear, including face masks, an email pinged in.

""PUT ON YOUR GAME FACE,"" it said. A sport merchandise site now sells face masks in the colors and logos of NFL teams.

Let me just note that some masks looked more appealing than others. The dancing Miami Dolphin could make you look like a bear with a fish in its mouth.

The website cautions that the team masks are, quote, ""a fashion face covering not intended to be personal protective equipment."" Proceeds from all sales will be donated to the CDC Foundation, supporting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But you might wonder: weeks and weeks into this pandemic, how can health care workers still lack enough protective masks, while masks for all 32 NFL teams are being sold as fashion items?

Justin Wolfers, an economist at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, told us the difference between the N95 masks used in hospitals and the football team masks is akin to the difference between real gems and costume jewelry.

The N95 respirator, when fit closely, is designed to block at least 95% of microscopic airborne particles. Of the football team masks, Professor Wolfers says, ""My understanding is that they're somewhat effective at preventing the wearer's germs from being sneezed out all over the place. But they don't provide much protection to the wearer from germs that others have sprayed in their way.""

In football terms, the NFL masks might be good defense, but offensive germs can still break through.

Justin Wolfers explains that the masks are produced by different supply lines. Medical manufacturers are stretched in this pandemic and find it hard to keep up with demand. But the apparel industry is shedding jobs and needs new work now. So while fashion masks roll out quickly, medical masks can be delayed.

""You could tell the story of American ingenuity, opening up new forms of production as needed,"" Professor Wolfers told us. ""I was thinking more the opposite though. How difficult it can be to get an economy to shift overnight, especially given that we've needed these masks for quite a while.""

As a Bears fan, I haven't decided whether to buy a logo mask. Even if they're limited as protective gear, they're surely a telling memento of these times.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/05/02/849304170/opinion-nfl-fashion-masks-but-still-not-enough-protective-masks

Jo Hood impatiently waited for 5 p.m. Thursday — the hour Alabama's stay-at-home order lifted.

""It's time,"" he says before propping open the door at Jane Loves Shoes, a women's boutique named for and owned by Hood's wife Jane. They have three small storefronts in this outdoor shopping center in Orange Beach – a resort town on the Alabama Gulf Coast. They sell shoes, women's clothing, accessories and gifts.

Hood says he wanted to open as soon as it was legal as a ceremonial gesture after being closed for more than a month.

""I'm not sure what to expect,"" he says. ""But any business would be better than none.""

The question facing Hood and thousands of other small businesses around the country is whether people are ready to shop again in a pandemic.

Some states are beginning to ease restrictions on commerce imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In Alabama, beaches have opened up, and retail stores are now allowed to operate at half capacity. Restaurants are still limited to take-out or delivery only.

Tourists – a key customer base – are returning. You can see it in the parking lots at the public beaches and grocery stores – car tags from Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Michigan, and Virginia.

April, May and June are typically the busiest months for Jane Loves Shoes, which employs six people. The store lost half of its March business and all of April.

Hood says it's been frustrating that big box stores like Walmart and Target remained open, selling the same goods.

""I have mixed feelings about it,"" he says, adding that he has shopped at Target during the shutdown. ""I needed those things, and I'm glad they weren't closed.""

But he says it's unfair that people could buy a swimsuit or a pair of shoes there, but not his store. ""People are still trying those clothes on and putting them back on the rack,"" he says.

His employees have spent the last month deep cleaning and reorganizing.

""Doing everything we can to make it safe,"" Sydney Allegri says.

Seating areas have been spread out, each stocked with disposable footies for trying on shoes. Hood says clerks will hand the shoes to customers but won't be touching any feet. Disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers are available. At check-out everyone will be given their own sanitized pen to keep once they sign out. Workers will frequently wipe down door handles and other commonly touched spaces. And signs posted on the door explain social distancing and offer masks for customers.

Hood says social distancing should not be a problem, even though the store is small.

Hood says they occasionally have groups of women on a trip that come in together. ""But otherwise generally, we're one to three people at a time,"" he says.

Beyond the new safety protocols, the business is changing in a more fundamental way.

""Guess I won't hug anymore,"" Allegri says.

Jane Loves Shoes caters to a mature clientele – people who might be at higher risk for COVID-19.

Clerk Haleigh Yeates says there's some uncertainly about whether that group of shoppers will be ready to come back in just yet.

""If they come great,"" she says. ""If not, I understand.""

Yeates says she has become close with some of their regular customers.

""Almost family like,"" she says, describing how they sit together and talk. Now that can't happen anymore. Conversations will be from a 6-foot distance.

""We're gonna miss our normal,"" Yeates says.

Customers seem to miss it too based on the voicemails that have piled up.

""Hey Jo"" says one longtime client. ""I'm just so anxious for you all to get back open.""

Nonetheless, business this first day back is very slow. A lone customer is greeted enthusiastically by Sydney Allegri.

""It's our first day,"" she says. ""You're our first customer!""

Nancy Sebastian is looking for some new shorts.

""You see what I'm wearing – I'm wearing CVS clothes,"" Sebastian says.

She's a local real estate agent, and happy to be able to shop again, and not at the drug store.

""It feels really, really good,"" Sebastian says. ""I know there's so many mixed emotions with everybody but we have to get back to work.""

Sebastian says she trusts local merchants to operate in a safe manner.

""We are all going to do what we're supposed to do,"" she says. ""And everybody's at the beach right now and I'm hoping they're doing what they're supposed to do so they don't close it down again.""

Health officials warn if social distancing protocols aren't taken seriously, people will get sick, and businesses could suffer later.

Jo Hood calls it liberating to be back even under new norms.

""Small business commerce is a central part of our economy,"" Hood says. ""It's good to know we were able to practice it again.""

When the first crush of people sick with COVID-19 turned up at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, Benny Mathew says managers issued him and other nurses two N95 masks per week. Instead of throwing protective masks away after treating contagious patients, they stored them in paper bags.

""There's no way you're not getting it if you are working in the emergency room with the bare minimum protection,"" Matthew told NPR. He tested positive for COVID-19 on March 21 and said many of his co-workers got sick on the job.

""Some of them were in the hospital for almost a week,"" he said. ""Nurses carried this virus home and made their partners, kids and parents sick.""

At least 9,000 front-line nurses and other medical workers have contracted COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Federal agencies say dozens of nurses and other care providers have died.

NPR wanted to understand how this situation happened. How did the best-funded health care system in the world wind up sending nurses into wards full of people sick with a mysterious new respiratory virus without basic personal protective equipment?

The first warning signs emerged in early February, weeks before COVID-19 erupted in the United States. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, then warned of a ""severe disruption"" in the PPE supply chain.

""Demand is up to 100 times higher than normal,"" Tedros said. ""There are depleted stockpiles and backlogs of four to six months. Global stocks of masks and respirators are now insufficient to meet the needs.""

The U.S. relies on that same global supply chain, and some front-line medical workers appeared worried.

""Our main concern is that health care employers are not prepared,"" said Bonnie Castillo, executive director of National Nurses United, the nation's largest nurses' union.

In an interview with NPR in late February, Castillo said her organization had surveyed nurses working at hospitals across the country. They reported a troubling lack of personal protective equipment.

""Only 30% of the nurses are saying that there are sufficient supplies in stock,"" Castillo said.

During those crucial early weeks of the pandemic, President Trump was sending a different message, downplaying the threat of COVID-19 in the United States.

""By April or during the month of April, the heat, generally speaking, kills this kind of virus,"" Trump said Feb. 10. ""So that would be a good thing. But we're in great shape in our country.""

Hospitals also sounded confident.

""Everyone I've spoken to has taken substantial steps to make sure they are prepared,"" Nancy Foster of the American Hospital Association said in an interview with NPR in late February.

But NPR found that as the coronavirus took hold in the U.S., many federal agencies were aware a PPE shortage was looming. The CDC began urging hospitals to ration masks and gowns. The CDC and other federal agencies also relaxed safety guidelines, allowing PPE to be reused and making it possible for hospitals to use masks approved for construction workers.

Meanwhile, NPR found little was being done to expand the overall supply of masks, gowns and other PPE. As factories in China shut down, the Trump administration was still reporting no ""widespread shortages"" of medical supplies in the United States. On Feb. 27, 20 days after the WHO announced its warning, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a public notice acknowledging COVID-19 would ""likely impact the medical product supply chain.""

Even then, in late February and early March, little was done to expand domestic production of personal protective equipment to supplement scarce overseas supplies. In an interview with NPR last week, the American Hospital Association's Foster acknowledged hospitals were slow to grasp the scale of the problem.

""I think what none of us anticipated as fully as we should have is that a pandemic such as this one would cause a worldwide demand,"" she said.

Foster said hospitals urged Trump to use his authority under the Defense Production Act to force companies ""to really ramp up the ability of this country to make PPE,"" but that request from the AHA and other health care groups didn't happen until March 21, well after rationing of masks and gowns had begun.

The Trump administration has used the Defense Production Act sporadically during this crisis and instead has worked with companies on a voluntary basis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency also moved in late March and early April to buy more masks and gowns overseas, often competing with hospitals and states for the same scarce equipment. In late March, Trump suggested adequate PPE supplies already existed and were being stolen or misallocated.

NPR could find no evidence of widespread theft or misuse of PPE. Efforts to boost supplies didn't begin until weeks after the first warnings were sounded, and the government push to find new suppliers was often confused, pitting agencies against one another.

By April 8, the Trump administration announced that the national stockpile of protective equipment was 90% depleted and remaining supplies would be kept in reserve. The hospital industry acknowledges that even now, ""critical"" PPE shortages remain. Meanwhile, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs system of hospitals and clinics is still using ""austerity"" measures to ration masks and gowns.

The legal fight over how Americans will vote this year is rapidly turning into a war.

That's according to conservative ""election integrity"" advocates who accuse Democrats of using the current pandemic to push through changes that these groups say will undermine U.S. elections.

""We are watching as the Democrats and radicalized special interest groups are using this fog of COVID to fundamentally remake American elections,"" said Catherine Engelbrecht, the president of True the Vote, a group that says it is trying to protect against voter fraud. She spoke on Thursday during a webinar sponsored by a conservative nonprofit, the Committee for Justice.

Democrats and liberal advocacy groups say that they're actually trying to protect voters' rights and to eliminate obstacles they believe are intended to suppress the votes of minorities and others who tend to vote Democratic.

Of immediate concern to both sides are efforts to expand mail-in voting in response to the pandemic. A number of states are loosening restrictions on absentee ballots so people can vote without having to go to the polls in person. More than a dozen court cases have been filed in recent weeks either challenging those changes or calling for states to do even more to make mail-in voting accessible.

On Thursday, a federal judge denied a request by True the Vote to block a Nevada plan to send absentee ballots to all active voters for the state's June 9 primary. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du dismissed as ""speculative"" and ""without any factual basis"" the group's claim that the plan would expose the election to fraud and thereby dilute the votes of legitimate voters.

Marc Elias, an attorney leading the Democratic effort to expand voting options, called the decision ""yet another example of how Republican lies about voter fraud don't hold up in court.""

Still, True the Vote's attorney, James Bopp Jr., who also spoke on the webinar, said that getting rid of protections against fraud is the Democrats' ""game plan."" He said it is part of a decades-long scheme by Democrats to weaken the electoral process by fighting efforts to remove inactive voters from registration rolls and to impose strict photo ID requirements.

Some Republicans, including President Trump, have echoed those claims. On Thursday, the president tweeted about the need to stop Democrats from ""stealing the election."" Trump has repeatedly said that voter fraud is rampant, although there is no evidence that is the case. There is some evidence that absentee voting is more vulnerable to fraud, but even so, such cases are rare.

The issue will certainly be a recurring theme in the upcoming campaign. Both sides are aware that court decisions affecting voting rules could shape the outcome in November.

Democrats have intensified their push for states to implement changes they have long wanted, such as allowing same-day voter registration and eliminating the need for voters to provide an excuse to vote absentee. Elias has filed a separate suit in Nevada arguing that the state should allow third parties to collect and deliver absentee ballots for voters who might not be able to do so on their own.

Elias has also revised a lawsuit calling on Wisconsin to eliminate requirements that voters provide a photo ID when requesting an absentee ballot and have a witness sign their completed ballot. Efforts by Democrats to loosen the state's mail-in voting rules for the April 7 primary were blocked by Republicans, and tens of thousands of voters ended up going to the polls in person despite the health threat.

""While this is the latest lawsuit seeking to protect the right to vote during the COVID crisis, it won't be the last,"" Elias said in a statement. ""The hard work of fighting voter suppression in 2020 is far from finished. Indeed, in many ways, the fight has just begun.""

Also this week, voting rights groups were in court challenging an Oklahoma law that voters have their absentee ballots notarized and a Florida requirement that felons pay all fines and fees before regaining their right to vote.

Virginia Republicans also went to court to stop that state from removing its absentee ballot witness requirement. And Arizona's Republican attorney general asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule a lower court finding that a law prohibiting the collection of ballots by third parties is unconstitutional.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/05/02/849090889/the-legal-fight-over-voting-rights-during-the-pandemic-is-getting-hotter

Multiple cities have started door-to-door coronavirus screenings and testing in an effort to identify those who are infected and help severely ill people get treated.

It's a small part of a larger effort to test more Americans for coronavirus in order to get a handle on how widely it has spread and prevent another wave of infections as some parts of the economy slowly reopen.

Emergency medical technicians employed by the New Orleans-based company Ready Responders are working in New York City, New Orleans, Reno, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C., and plan to begin working in Los Angeles later this month.

In New York City, a pilot program with the company has been going on for about two weeks and is focused on eight public housing locations. It's meant to complement six new community testing sites that are also prioritizing New Yorkers who live in public housing.

The goal is to make sure residents understand the symptoms of COVID-19, and that they have access to coronavirus testing quickly and easily even if they don't have access to a car or a regular primary care physician.

""We wanted as many New Yorkers to be tested as possible,"" said Olivia Lapeyolerie, a spokesperson for New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio's office.

Mayelyn Rojas was assigned to distribute fliers, talk to residents about symptoms and do coronavirus tests this week at the Edenwald Houses in the Bronx.

""It's been pretty hectic,"" the 24-year-old EMT said, smiling behind her mask. ""I'm doing a lot of COVID calls. It's insane how often these calls are coming and they're just, like, 'No one's tested us before.'""

Rojas and other EMTs carry the protective equipment and materials, including nasal swabs, that they need to administer coronavirus tests. If a resident says they have one or more symptoms of COVID-19, or they think they were exposed to someone with the disease, the EMT sets up a telemedicine call with a doctor or nurse practitioner, who decides whether to order a coronavirus test.

When a patient needs a test, an EMT is dispatched to the person's apartment to take the sample right there in the living room. At the end of each day, the samples are mailed to a commercial lab and patients receive their results by text or on an online portal in two to three days.

Rojas says a lot of people with essential jobs are asking to be tested — a hospital administrator with a scratchy throat, a janitor with a fever, a maintenance worker feeling under the weather.

She has also noticed a rapid increase in demand for COVID-19 tests.

""Since they found out that we're now testing at home, the calls are non-stop,"" she said Thursday. She had run out of test kits earlier in the day and needed to go pick up more. At this rate, she estimates she's on track to do at least 25 tests each week.

It's a drop in the bucket — New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio said this week that about 13,000 tests are being conducted every day in the city, and epidemiologists warn that even that number is far lower than it needs to be in order to safely allow most people to leave their homes.

But at-home testing and screening allows medical providers to identify and treat people who likely would not have been tested or treated otherwise, including people who have serious cases of COVID-19.

Judy Vidal, 24, works part-time as an EMT for Ready Responders in New York City, and primarily works in Queens, a borough with some of the highest per-capita infection rates in the country. She says she has encountered people who have severe symptoms — shortness of breath, fever. In those cases, clinicians recommend that patients call 911, so they can be treated at a hospital, and it can fall to the EMT to help the family take that difficult step.

""They're not sure. 'Should I go? Should I not?' People are afraid,"" Vidal said.

Sometimes family members suggest that a sick person should wait one more day to go to the hospital. She said she tries to explain how people with COVID-19 can rapidly deteriorate.

""A day could be life or death,"" she said. ""We just have to persuade these patients to take that step, and their family too. Especially if we're talking about grandma or grandpa — we know that your parents are gonna be at the hospital by themselves. They're gonna feel lonely; it's going to feel strange. But the silver lining is your mom is going to come back.

""But actually that's the hard thing. We can't promise that their relative is going to come back, because we don't know.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/05/02/848525576/no-one-has-tested-us-before-emts-go-door-to-door-with-test-kits

As states around the country begin lifting stay-at-home orders, individuals face their own choice over whether it feels safe to resume activities we all used to take for granted.

We asked NPR listeners to tell us how they are making these decisions and nearly 250 people responded.

In general, it's clear that even as local officials lift restrictions, many people plan to wait longer before resuming their old routines.

""As long as there are new cases, I think it's not really safe,"" says Naomi Silas, a freelance graphic designer and graduate student in Grand Rapids, Mich.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer extended her ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" order through May 15, with some changes. For example golfing and boating are allowed now. But Silas says even going to a park with her 8-year-old son doesn't feel comfortable yet.

""Because there's just too many people and you can never be too sure. I think especially when the weather is really nice here in Michigan, people get kind of careless,"" Silas says.

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock's stay-at-home order expired this past week. Businesses can open if they follow physical distancing and other guidelines.

Still, on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, Camille Stein is taking more precautions than Montana recommends. That means more hours at home with her three daughters, who typically are busy with sports.

Stein plans to maintain restrictions for a few weeks and monitor the number of COVID-19 cases. She's also still deciding what to do this summer when her daughters usually are swimming

""That's something we're looking at too [that] we're nervous about. Would we even want to send our kids to swimming?"" wonders Stein.

Some NPR listeners told us they haven't had the luxury of sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic. Marnie Shale lives in Bloomington, Ind., and was stocking grocery shelves even as other businesses were closed.

""People were not staying home from the grocery store, in fact it was extremely crowded. So I was on my knees and people are above me, reaching over to get things... So I thought well, I'm not isolated to begin with,"" Shale says.

She's also a nurse and plans to start a new job at a long-term care facility soon. Without the ability to shelter in place, Shale says she looks forward to eating out in restaurants again. The only things she's not comfortable doing are long distance travel such as flying or taking a cruise.

In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp was one of the last to issue stay-at-home orders and he's among the first to reopen businesses, including nail and hair salons.

""I wasn't pleased with the decision to open us back up,"" says Regina Ellis, co-owner of Esuites, a salon in Albany.

Ellis says she knows people who have died from the coronavirus. While she's sympathetic to workers who need to earn a living, she's watching infection rates and plans to wait a few more weeks before going back to work herself.

Ellis says her customers understand.

""They don't want to come to the salon just to look good — to look good in a casket,"" she says.

The state of Arizona also is starting to lift restrictions on some retail businesses, though Gov. Doug Ducey has extended social distancing guidelines through May 15.

South of Phoenix in the city of Casa Grande, Episcopal Priest Dave Rickert says he's sticking with online-only services for now.

""I'm going to go a couple Sundays, let my other parishes — my sister and brother parishes — kind of be guinea pigs,"" Rickert says.

When it feels safe to resume services he's thinking about changes, such as removing some pews to create more distance between people.

Across the country decisions governors make get a lot of attention. But it's clear that millions of individual decisions also will determine how quickly we all return to our normal routines.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/05/02/849076177/as-coronavirus-restrictions-ease-many-still-wary

What happens when you go back to a place you thought was your home, only to find it profoundly different? That's the subject explored in Puerto Rican indie pop duo Buscabulla's debut album, Regresa, out on May 8.

Buscabulla is made up of husband and wife Luis Alfredo Del Valle and Raquel Berrios, two Puerto Rico-born musicians who were based in New York until 2017. When their birthplace was devastated by Hurricanes Maria and Irma that year, they decided to leave New York and go back to where they were born. It was an emotional journey, one that inspired the songs of Regresa and which they chronicled for an upcoming mini-documentary.

""There is something meaningful to being back here,"" Del Valle says. ""There is something meaningful to coming back to the place that sort of made you.

NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro spoke to Luis Alfredo Del Valle and Raquel Berrios about making the decision to move back to Puerto Rico, how the island has changed and capturing their conflicting notions of home on their debut album. Listen to the radio version in the audio link above and read on for highlights of the interview.

Interview Highlights

On the internal call to return home to Puerto Rico

Raquel Berrios: Coming back to Puerto Rico was sort of something that was always in the back of my mind. And the funny thing is that when I met Luis, it was sort of something that he kind of dreamt about as well. I always sort of felt incomplete in New York, even though we had a beautiful community and we were thriving with our careers and with our music. Puerto Rico has something — and you probably know it if you know a Puerto Rican — there's something about this island that really calls you. And our daughter was born in 2014 and that only made the feeling stronger.

YouTube

Luis Alfredo Del Valle: You know, home is a complicated concept. I think in your head, a lot of what you conceive of as home is maybe tied to your upbringing and your childhood and all this stuff. And I think, having enough distance from anywhere for enough time, you come back and it will have changed. I mean, a lot of the people that we knew and loved and our friends have moved out. Even close family doesn't live here anymore. A lot of our own close family has moved out. And to me it does feel, in that way, different.

I think that perhaps being away from Puerto Rico for a while, you can fall into this naiveté of idealizing your home. I think that coming back was, in a way, one of those curious reality checks where we felt the complexity; we felt the isolation; we felt detachment from the concept that we were that we had in our mind before going there. I think one thing that we learned was that it is complex to be anywhere, to call any place a home. Nothing is perfect. Nothing is going to be 110% happiness all the time, it is sort of within you. But there is something meaningful to coming back to the place that sort of made you.

On the impact of the move on the band's sound

Berrios: I would say that it's maybe broadened and evolved. I like how when we first got here, we just wanted to try really, really different things. I think that maybe it was a reflection that we were out of our comfort zone and that we were really trying to kind of fit in. And then as time passed by, just coming home maybe has made us a little bit more wanting to be more bold, or trying to make a stronger statement. Before, we used to kind of drown my voice more in reverb, and now I wanted my voice to be a little bit more — I think I wanted to show more of my emotion maybe than I ever had before.

On the double meaning of the band's name, which translates to ""troublemaker"" in English

Del Valle: Buscabulla was a project that essentially, I think just came out of Raquel's mind. It's a Puerto Rican slang word. I think it's appropriate in an interesting way because it has a double meaning. Bulla in Spanish can be like a ruckus, like a good time — or it can be a fight. So you could be looking for either trouble or reconciliation; or you could be looking for two opposite things.

YouTube

On the song ""NTE,"" which stands for ""No te equivoques"" or ""Make no mistake""

Berrios: ""No te equivoques"" is definitely something we use a lot here in Puerto Rico. ""NTE"" was another kind of angsty song, kind of related to once we kind of started getting bigger and people started to get to know the band. We live in a time, I really feel when being an artist is really hard. I think social media has made it hard. A lot of the narrative of who you are is not so much controlled by you anymore. And so ""NTE"" is about not getting us wrong. It's also like defiance — of coming back to Puerto Rico, even though it's clearly something that a lot of people would tell us to not do. And so ""NTE"" is more like a defiant sort of song about like, ""You can't really tell me what to do. You can't really tell me who I am.""

Don't see this video? Click here.

In our new series on the art of sampling, hip-hop producers demonstrate how they find inspiration in classics, hidden gems, found sounds and other raw musical materials to create new hits. For each of the five videos in the series, NPR Music has asked a writer we love to do something similar. Their only instruction was to watch one of the videos, pick an element that inspired them, and spin it off in a new direction — to sample it.

Today, Danyel Smith, the author of the forthcoming book Shine Bright: A Personal History of Black Women in Pop, follows the links between today's featured producer, Salaam Remi, and stars like Amy Winehouse and Nas to trace the essential role of collaboration in musical creation, and finds herself ruminating on a hit Babyface made with the singer Karyn White in 1989.

Salaam Remi's words immediately make me think about the Fugees and Amy Winehouse and Nas and the art of collaboration. The sight of him makes me remember running into Remi on the street in 2015 Brooklyn and how normal it was to recognize a person's whole face at first glance, to embrace and catch-up without the fabric masks of plague. My brain calls up the tragedies of that time, recalls how slow-moving they felt. The Weeknd's ""Can't Feel My Face"" was a huge hit that year. Little did we know.

I think of Remi as diplomat and counselor in the way successful producers must be — or else have middling songs and short careers. That thought brings me to the randomness of timing and how both Remi and Nas lost their mothers in flanking years. I think about vulnerability and how Pharrell convinces Snoop Dogg, when Snoop was going through a musical reinvention, to rap from the stance of a mature man deeply in love with his wife, Shante Broadus. To, as Snoop quotes Pharrell, ""put that in the vein."" About how Snoop must have felt seen, and understood. Same for when Remi challenges Winehouse to rise to the honor of a beat he created for Nas. To be our best, some of us need to dared.

Remi's talk about the tangles of creative partnership coincided with the recent Instagram Live Verzuz battle between producers Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds and Teddy Riley. I tend to think more often about Babyface than Riley because, either by himself or with partners Antonio ""L.A."" Reid and Darryl Simmons, Babyface has created hits with (among others) the Whispers, Pebbles, Whitney Houston, Johnny Gill, Boyz II Men, Tevin Campbell and TLC — these artists are beacons in my life. Plus, Babyface as performing artist has always been a favorite. The sunglasses, brown skin and high cheekbones. His turns of phrase, the relaxed way he plays guitar — all of it appeals.

I wrote about Edmonds' third solo album, For The Cool In You, in 1993. I was 28, in a new job as R&B editor of Billboard, and my doomed first marriage was choking on childhood wounds. I was freelancing too, stacking chips, and in the New York Times review I talk about Edmonds as ""purveyor of dreamy love and even dreamier heartbreak."" This mood washed through me like saline and sugar. I noted Edmonds' ribbons of emotional detail. I considered his status on the musical landscape. But as with most intimate fanships, mine was born in the relief of feeling understood. Singer/songwriter Karyn White felt similarly. ""L.A. and Babyface ... really helped shape who Karyn White was,"" she has said. ""That was their gift, to be able to see what was special in me.""

***

When I think about Whitney Houston with Babyface and Toni Braxton with Babyface and Janet Jackson with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Beyoncé with Swizz Beatz and The-Dream and Ciara with Jazze Pha and Mariah Carey with Jermaine Dupri, I am reaffirmed in my belief that reciprocal respect makes for the most transcendent art. That the pygmalion model — if it ever widely existed beyond making women creators palatable to a male-genius-loving cultural machine — is usually a more balanced alliance.

I rise up in women's collaborations with Edmonds because they feel mutual. Toni Braxton's 1992 ""Love Should Have Brought You Home"" stands out. As does Houston's glowing ""Exhale (Shoop, Shoop)"" from the 1995 soundtrack to Waiting to Exhale. All of the performing artists featured are black women, every song is written or co-written by Babyface, and the project is comfortably on the list of top 10 best-selling soundtracks ever. As for collaboration at the executive producer level: Whitney Houston and Clive Davis had final say on all contributors.

Babyface — fifth of six brothers from Indianapolis, raised by a widowed mother — has deeply-felt songs on hard drives he's forgotten about. But Karyn White's 1989 ""Superwoman"" is a perfect recording. ""We spent a lot of time on that vocal,"" she said, ""because I was too young."" She hadn't lived enough life yet. ""A 'superwoman' is a person who endures all ... and rises above it. So today when I sing it, I kill it.""

YouTube

Songwriting credits: L.A. Reid, Babyface and Darryl Simmons. Production by L.A. and Babyface for LaFace Productions. On lead vocals, emotional lifting, bravery, and extreme vulnerability: Karen Layvonne White of Los Angeles, California. ""Superwoman"" pops off like a go-ahead run — and it was for White. The leadoff single from her next album, 1991's No. 1 pop hit ""Romantic,"" produced by Jimmy Jam and White's future husband, Terry Lewis, was a grand slam. On deck for Babyface and L.A. Reid: Whitney Houston's ""I'm Your Baby Tonight,"" the soundtrack to Boomerang and Toni Braxton's massive self-titled debut.

About ""Superwoman"" though, White has been known for modesty. ""That was my blessing,"" she said of the song in 2012. ""They could've given that song to anybody. Everybody wanted to work with them ... so for them to see in me that strength, that I could ... carry that song, was brilliant. Besides, Babyface is one of the most prolific writers of the century. For him to have that sensibility of what a woman really feels — he just gets it.""

Babyface did have specific pop goals for the record. ""He wanted to write a song in the mode of the 1971 Fifth Dimension hit 'One Less Bell to Answer,' written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David,"" says writer Ed Hogan. ""Babyface wanted to have some of the same everyday elements — one less egg to fry, one less man to pick up after.""

And with lyrics like —

Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table

And make sure that your coffee has its sugar and cream

Your eggs are over easy

Your toast done lightly

All that's missing is your morning kiss

That used to greet me

— they got there. ""It's all about lyrics,"" as Remi says above. ""And knowing what the lyrical intent is, and knowing what the intent of the record is.""

White's voice — with its distinctive rasp and sweetness — is its own revelation. ""This song was an anthem,"" White said in 2018. ""It separated me from the Pebbles and the Janet Jacksons and the Jody Watleys I was being compared to."" The daughter of a beautician and a real estate agent who played trumpet on the side, the former cheerleader had sung background for Sheena Easton and Julio Iglesias. Inspired by heroes Diana Ross, Liza Minelli, Tina Turner and Sammy Davis Jr., White peels off thrillingly awkward, un-rhyming lyrics with bold sorrow —

I'm not the kind of girl

That you can let down

And think that everything's okay

Boy, I am only human

— and then the stomping demand:

This girl needs more than

Occasional hugs as a token of love

From you to me

""Superwoman"" works as thrilling showdown. As refutation of the strong black woman yoke. As a pure and contemporary blues. As a creative collaboration for all time. The song spent three weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's R&B singles chart, and went to No. 8 on Billboard's pop singles chart. White began years later to refer to the record as her testimony.

By 1999, White was divorced from Lewis. Her mother Vivian passed away near the same time. ""I believe,"" she said in 2012, ""that I became depressed, and didn't want to sing."" White moved from Minneapolis back to California, began work in real estate and didn't record again professionally for decades. ""I'm really good at goals, and focusing,"" she's said. ""Like if it's, I wanna be singer, a dancer, whatever it is, I'm really great at that. But I didn't feel like I could do it all, great. Be a mother, be a wife, be an entertainer. It was kind of strange, but ... I stepped back.""

Last week, White posted about the Babyface/Teddy Riley battle on her own popular Instagram feed.

This, so far, is a producer/songwriters' battle, and it works because it showcases the distinctly collaborative art of creating big records. ""Amy made me a better producer,"" says Salaam Remi. ""She had a knack for saying really smart stuff, and I had a knack for pushing her to write what she really was thinking."" The plaits of collaboration are tight. But as sure as in baseball the tie goes to the runner — in music, the song and the love it inspires goes to them that perform it. It's one of the reasons this Verzuz series, created by producers Swizz Beatz and Timbaland, works. It brings producers and songwriters out of parenthesis and into all-caps. And along with D-Nice's Club Quarantine, the throwdowns remind a pandemic-weary world of what it is to feel seen and understood — in a moment when we understand so little.

It was in response to Teddy Riley playing his remix of Janet Jackson's ""I Get Lonely"" that Babyface, robust after recovering from a positive COVID-19 test, reminded everyone that he doesn't do remixes. Then he pressed play on White's ""Superwoman."" The virtual crowd — over a half million people — went wild.

If you feel it in your heart

And you understand me

Stop right where you are

Everybody sing along with

Depending on where you live in the United States, turning the calendar from April to May means entering the second or third month of an indefinite period of social distancing. With little other choice in the way of entertainment, people have naturally turned to streaming TV to fill the time and to escape from the increasingly bleak news. Deciding among the available options can be overwhelming, however, and even a trending phenomenon like Tiger King can fall off the radar in an instant.

More than a way to burn through the hours cooped up at home, though, television can be a vital vehicle for music discovery. With the recent arrival of a Spike Jonze-directed Beastie Boys documentary on Apple TV, the ongoing Bachelor musical spin-off Listen to Your Heart and the upcoming release of Damien Chazelle's modern Parisian jazz tale The Eddy, now is as good a time as ever to stream TV with an ear towards the soundtrack.

From the stories of real-life musicians to scripted series with great music supervision, here are a few categories of music television to brighten your lockdown — and maybe inspire your next playlist.

Stories About Music And Musicians

Beastie Boys Story (2020)

One part live storytelling performance, one part career retrospective and one part tribute to late Beastie Boys MC Adam Yauch, Beastie Boys story is as form and genre-agnostic as the influential band that it profiles. Spike Jonze's documentary is centered around the two living Beasties, Adam Horowitz and Michael Diamond, re-telling the story of their journey from New York hardcore scene teens to international rap party boys to the boundary-redefining hip-hop artists they eventually became.

Streaming on: Apple TV+

The Eddy (2020)

The Eddy is the first foray into television for Damien Chazelle, writer and director of Whiplash and La La Land. Chazelle is responsible for some of the most memorable onscreen depictions of jazz performance in the last decade, and The Eddy -- starring Andre Holland as an American musician struggling to keep his Parisian jazz club open — promises to continue the streak. The series premieres May 8.

Streaming on: Netflix

Country Music (2019)

No one makes docuseries more sweeping, meticulous or detailed than those of Ken Burns. His most recent project is Country Music, an eight-part exploration of the distinctly American art form's long history. The series is a must-watch if you are a longtime loves of all things country and western — and if you are an ""anything but country"" type, the care and precision of Burns' storytelling might just show you the error of your ways.

Streaming on: PBS Passport, Amazon Prime

Nashville (2012-2018)

Nashville's six seasons told a soapy tale of drama, betrayal, jealousy and country music, set of course in the genre's capital. T Bone Burnett — who helped spark the modern Americana renaissance with his deftly curated O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack — was the show's music director for its first season, and stars as noteworthy as Lucinda Williams and Patty Griffin contributed songs. If you're interested in high drama, industry shenanigans and honest-to-goodness great original country songs, look no further.

A one-season Netflix drama, The Get Down follows a fictional group of aspiring rappers, DJs and artists in the South Bronx, just as hip-hop is taking root in the late 1970s. In their quest to make a dent in the nascent form, interact with real-life hip-hop founders Grandmaster Flash, DJ Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa — or at least actors playing them. It's a fun, fast-paced watch that showcases some classic hip-hop and also functions as a light history lesson on the origins of a style that has taken over the world.

Wu-Tang: An American Saga (2019)

If you're already a fan of the most important group ever to come out of Staten Island, then the sell for a TV show dramatizing the beginnings of the Wu-Tang Clan is easy. If you're not, the RZA-helmed biographical drama Wu-Tang: An American Saga functions as an excellent primer for how unique the group's music was and still is.

Flight of the Conchords (2007-2009)

The trials and tribulations of ""New Zealand's fourth most popular folk parody duo"" trying to make it big in America made for a mashup of sitcom and musical rarely seen befre when the show arrived in 2007. But the real key to Flight of the Conchords is that the songs of Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie aren't just funny — many are deeply catchy, even out of context. (If you're not a French speaker, ""Foux Du Fafa"" could be an upbeat lounge single from the 1960s.)

Shows With Great Soundtracks

Insecure (2016-Present)

Now in its fourth season, Issa Rae's Insecure has developed a well-deserved reputation for picking out new hip-hop and R&B tracks that fit its moods perfectly. It's also extremely bingeable, a combination of sharp comedic writing and hook-you-in drama. For a crash course on some of the best R&B released since 2016, you could do much worse than making your way through Insecure and writing down every song you hear.

Streaming on: HBO

High Fidelity (2020)

With needle drops on classic rock mainstays like David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix alongside contemporary artists like Y La Bamba and Omar Apollo, this new spin on the 2000 filmis anchored by exactly the kind of painstakingly eclectic soundtrack you'd expect from a show about the owner of a record store. It's also a story made to inspire spirited music debates with friends, which can be a blast even when it's happening over a video call.

Streaming on: Hulu

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (2015-2019)

There is perhaps no single showcase for the depth and scope of the late Adam Schlesinger's musical prowess better than Crazy Ex-Girlfriend: The Fountains of Wayne songwriter wrote or co-wrote 157 original songs over the show's four-season run. If you want a sense of why music communities were so particularly devastated by his loss, making your way through Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and the smart, genre-hopping tunes in each episode is a great place to start.

Streaming on: Netflix

Atlanta (2016-Present)

Considering it is written by and stars Donald Glover, one of the brightest and most multifaceted talents in music and Hollywood right now, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Atlanta is full of smart music references, clever song placements and perfectly deployed rapper cameos. If you're a fan of contemporary hip-hop, the show is worth watching just for the season-one Migos appearance. Plus, the fictional trap banger that instigates Atlanta's plot is pretty good in its own right.

Streaming on: Hulu

Babylon Berlin (2017-Present)

Babylon Berlin is a German neo-noir set in Weimar-era Berlin, more specifically in its bars and nightclubs. The show's creators took capturing the era's music so seriously that they assembled a 14-piece band to record the soundtrack and perform in the nightclub scenes — and in turn, that group has now become a serious touring orchestra in Germany.

Streaming on: Netflix

Twin Peaks (1990-1991, 2017)

David Lynch's cult classic about a myserious murder in an eerily insular town in the Pacific Northwest is surreal, perplexing and impeccably scored. The theme song and most of the soundtrack is ambient synth-driven pop tunes do much of the heavy lifting in establishing the show's atmosphere. If you exhaust the two seasons from the early 1990s, the series was also revived for one year as Twin Peaks: The Return in 2017, available for streaming on Showtime.

Streaming on: Netflix, Hulu, Showtime

Samurai Champloo (2004)

Samurai Champloo is a critically acclaimed but short-lived anime from 2004 whose influence you might recognize in a certain corner of hip-hop today. The late Japanese production titan Nujabes wrote the show's opening and closing themes as well as much of the soundtrack, and the combination of sleek animated visuals and his signature melodic, sample-heavy hip-hop struck a chord that still reverberates today. If you have ever studied or relaxed to a lo-fi hip-hop beat, you can thank the work that Nujabes did on this soundtrack.

Streaming on: Hulu

Westworld (2016-Present)

For better and for worse, no show makes more creative use of pop music than Westworld, HBO's often thrilling, often frustrating, always confusing dystopian sci-fi western. To help create the show's eerie both past and future atmosphere, Ramin Djawadi scored it with old-fashioned player piano reimaginings of popular music. At their worst, the songs are too on the nose and make the show into a game of ""Name That Tune."" But at their best — like the season-one transformation of The Rolling Stones' ""Paint It Black"" into a sweeping Ennio Morricone-style orchestral epic — they create exhilarating moments of recognition that draw you further into the scene and put familiar songs in a new light.

Streaming on: HBO

The Americans (2013-2018)

Credit to NPR Music contributor Hanif Abdurraqib for inspiring this pick. It can be difficult for a historical drama to pull off pop song placements that don't feel too obvious or too clever, but The Americans manages to thread the needle, setting thrilling scenes of '80s Cold War espionage and betrayal to a smart mix of massive hits and hidden gems from the era.

The Last Dance (2020)

You'll need to have at least a passing interest in basketball to get anything out of The Last Dance, ESPN's 10-part documentary epic covering Michael Jordan's final year with the Chicago Bulls, but the show will more than reward you musically. So far, each episode has featured at least one absolutely immaculately paired montage — from the earth-shattering ease of Jordan's early career highlights set to Eric B. & Rakim's equally casually jaw-dropping ""I Ain't No Joke"" to Dennis Rodman jumping into the stands to the tune of the Beastie Boys' ""The Maestro."" The series is airing Sundays on ESPN, and will come to Netflix July 19.

The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart (2020)

As one contestant — who presumably has not watched the 2017 Bradley Cooper film all the way to the end — sums up in a trailer, the appeal of the newest Bachelor spinoff is simple: It's a reality TV A Star is Born. Combining two of the most tried and true reality formats, Listen to Your Heart is both a dating show and music competition, in which single musicians couple up and then perform duets to impress a rotating series of celebrity judges.

Rhythm + Flow (2019-Present)

Featuring Chance the Rapper, Cardi B and T.I. as judges — as well as guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Anderson .Paak, Fat Joe and others — Rhythm + Flow pits up-and-coming rappers from across the country against each other for $250,000 and the exposure that comes from impressing so many famous faces. If you don't mind a spoiler and want a taste of the talent competing on the show, here's a link to the most recent music video from the first season's eventual winner.

The Masked Singer (2019-Present)

By now, you are surely familiar with The Masked Singer, the Korean game show concept turned worldwide phenomenon in which celebrities in elaborate disguises sing karaoke and only reveal their true identities upon elimination. It's a bit of a mess — the format and rules seem to change between episodes, and it is never fully clear what the judges actually do — but as a pure streamable spectacle it is unmatched. The inherent mystery makes it an extra-fun watch with a group, and you'd be surprised how much seeing an unknown celebrity belt out a pop favorite from underneath an oversized animal mask can take your mind off of troubling world events for a little bit.

Our Daily Breather is a series where we ask writers and artists to recommend one thing that's helping them get through the days of isolation during the coronavirus pandemic.

Who: Michael Trotter of The War and Treaty

Where: Nashville, Tenn.

Recommendation: Embracing childhood nostalgia and taking time to make memories with your loved ones

Well, I must be honest: I've been going back to my childhood lately. I've discovered cool apps and channels that cater to entertainment that was a little bit more healthier for the brain like The Andy Griffith Show, Leave It To Beaver, Laverne & Shirley, Three's Company, Sanford and Son, Family Matters and one of my all time favorites, Mama's Family.

I've also binged-watched series I love like Gunsmoke, Have Gun – Will Travel and Bonanza. Of course you will say, ""Michael, that's not TV from your day,"" but I beg to differ. When I was a young lad I spent a lot of time with my dad watching reruns of those westerns and with my mom watching reruns of those shows I mentioned prior. I watched the reruns so much that I thought it was regular TV programming. And now that I'm 38 years old, I remember the actual setting of those days as well.

With mom we'd be eating tuna fish and crackers, drinking Welch's grape juice and eating Mars bars as dessert. Mom would be sitting on the couch and I'd be laying in my favorite spot of the house in the corner by a heater vent with my blanket. We'd play this game to see who knew the most commercial jingles and we'd sing them and laugh so hard we'd cry tears of joy.

With dad we'd be in the TV room in our house waiting for Little Joe (actor Michael Landon) to sock some stranger in the mouth for getting out of line. Or waiting for some big tough guy to waltz into a bar and pick a fight only to find Hoss (Dan Blocker) standing behind him ready to give him a thumping. During commercial breaks Dad and I would do our Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene) impressions and we'd laugh at each other so hard we'd both start coughing uncontrollably. Dad would be in his recliner and I'd be laid out on a pile of blankets I'd lay on the floor. We'd be eating turkey sandwiches or corned beef sandwiches we'd get from Harvard Deli in Cleveland, Ohio.

With my siblings we'd rush to the living room to get daily lessons from Family Matters. One episode I remember was when the cops had wrongly accused Eddie Winslow (Darius McCrary), and his dad Carl Winslow (Reginald VelJohnson) would come to his rescue. That's where we first learned about police brutality, but the show also showed a side of the black family I hadn't seen before. It showed fathers hugging and kissing on their sons. It showed no yelling in discipline, but education was key, even in chastisement.

My opinion of discipline changed because of that show and I find myself dealing with my little Legend (eight years old) like Carl and Eddie. So you see, we weren't just watching TV but creating intimate memories that will last forever. Use this time to create memories with your beautiful family. That's all the mental health you need.

Lately, we've been sharing some of favorite entries to the 2020 Tiny Desk Contest, which closed for entries on April 27. We've seen entries from every state in the country; from big bands and solo artists; and from a huge range of styles and genres — and now, our judges will start to comb through our entries to find a winner.

This year brought particular challenges to our Contest community. Today, we shared the news on our website and in our newsletter that, because of the coronavirus pandemic, our annual On The Road tour with our winner won't be happening. We will, however, be starting a new virtual series with our judges and member stations to highlight the best entries from this year's Contest. We're excited to share more details with you soon.

Despite this year's conditions, we've been so impressed with how artists rose to the challenge and got creative under difficult circumstances. Those of us watching entries have noticed that many artists aren't simply adapting to these new circumstances; they're using this time to share music that speaks directly to our current moment. This week, we wanted to highlight some of the artists who sent us songs that have helped the Tiny Desk Contest community feel connected in a time of isolation, physical distancing and uncertainty.

Alisa Amador, ""Together""

YouTube

In a time when being apart is necessary to our survival, Alisa Amador's ""Together"" is a unifying light in a tunnel of solitude and a salve to the pain we've all become so accustomed to enduring. Amador told NPR Music she wrote the song three years ago, after talking to another musician who had lost the ability to play due to a medical condition. ""This musician listed the ways that they were coping,"" Amador says, ""and all of them had to do with connecting with others. I went home and started to write: 'All of the people of all of the Earth / Each with a piece of all this hurt.'""

For Amador, the song and its sentiment took on a particular significance against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""I've always seen songs as this intangible space of belonging — a place outside of the physical realm that holds the listener and accompanies them in whatever they are going through,"" she says. ""And now, in the absence of being able to hold a physical space with others, the song is the hug that we cannot give, the room that we cannot share."" Amador crystallizes that feeling in the song's final chorus, when the camera pans out to reveal a choir of fellow musicians, family and friends in a vision of collective solidarity. —Pilar Fitzgerald

Kora Feder, ""In a Young Person's Body""

YouTube

Kora Feder's melodic folk song ""In a Young Person's Body"" is a sign of the times. From the heartbreak of newsworthy stories like John Prine's death to the subtle-yet-crushing feeling that accompanies remembering each morning's sobering reality, Feder's lyrics eloquently illustrate the full range of emotions many people are feeling in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Appropriately, Feder wrote and recorded the song while quarantining in her Philadelphia apartment. She shared with NPR Music that she ""decided to be as honest as [she] could about [her] routine these days, physical and emotional.""

Feder also shared that she hopes her video will call attention to those in need and spark action: ""I think this pandemic is bringing the fragility of human life into perspective for a lot of people. Hopefully, we can use some of that awareness to bring change to those communities that need it most."" —Elle Mannion

KPH & The Canary Collective, ""One Sided Glass""

YouTube

KPH & The Canary Collective is the music of Kaeley Pruitt-Hamm, Kerenza Peacock and Justine Brown; the group describes itself as seeking ""to highlight voices of 'canaries' at the forefront of human and environmental health epidemics."" In the entry's YouTube description, Pruitt-Hamm says she wrote ""One Sided Glass"" after being diagnosed with a disease affecting her immune system, nervous system and lungs and that she was ""mostly bedridden from 2015-2019.""

Pruitt-Hamm says that experience was incredibly isolating; now, given the conditions of the current pandemic, she says the song feels especially relevant. ""So many more people [are] experiencing what it's like to be stuck in your bedroom for days on end, separated from loved ones and unable to move [forward] with what we thought we had in store in our lives,"" Pruitt-Hamm writes. The song describes these feelings of loneliness, but reaches towards community and connection. ""I don't think that we are alone / As much as we think,"" Pruitt-Hamm repeats in the song, joined by her other two band members singing harmonies. Ultimately, ""One Sided Glass"" is a song of hope. —Marissa Lorusso",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2020/04/30/847818357/tiny-desk-contest-2020-entries-that-help-us-feel-connected

When reality feels more like a neurotic moving target, a few snaps of the synapses couldn't really hurt right about now, right? If you're fiending for a mental reset the likes of Men in Black's Neuralyzer — brief, fuzzy, just enough to take the edge off — divergent heat from Octavian, Tora and Kali Uchis will do the trick.

Plus, Isaiah Rashad makes his long-awaited return as part of TDE Appreciation Week, Tom Misch and Yussef Dayes finally unveil with the full extent of their hip-hop-jazz fellowship and Mulatto takes no prisoners for an unrelenting 32 bars. Un-hunch your shoulders and isolate the memories of these new music moments.

As always, Heat Check provides sonic whiplash and tempts burgeoning curiosity on Spotify.

Octavian, ""Poison"" (feat. Santi, OBONGJAYAR, Take A Day Trip)

When South London's Octavian links up with Santi and OBONGJAYAR, two of Nigeria's rising stars, it's almost a guarantee the result will sound like nothing else out. Delirious, submerged percussion (provided by producer duo Take A Day Trip) sets the stage for a warning about overdosing on the ""poison"" of love: ""A girl like that will leave your mind erased."" Of course, they're not worried enough to completely stay away.

In the song's video, admission into a club costs the price of temporary insanity. The night devolves into a languid fever dream filled with black lights, Avirex, foggy pupils and blonde dreads braided into constraints.

YouTube

Tora, ""Vein""

""I can just release my nature,"" the London-based singer assures with a tone that feels like a welcoming, open-palmed hand. However, once the synthetic chorus hits, a frenzy of concepts clash that will leave you like a shaken Etch A Sketch.

YouTube

L'Suavo, ""Deep End (feat. Dyna Edyne)""

A grounded bass and quippy, grin-guiding verses from L'Suavo welcome you in just as it becomes clear that those faint police sirens in the background are no match for the siren song Dyna Edyne deploys in the third verse. These are two Florida artists worth keeping an ear on.

YouTube

Kali Uchis, ""i want war (BUT I NEED PEACE)""

Like many musicians, Kali Uchis is injecting her time in self-quarantine with a dose of creative whimsy. The Isolation artist shared a four-song EP last week titled To Feel Alive, an effort she produced and recorded primarily alone in her room ""in a couple of days"" to process her feelings about moments lost and futures unknown. The end product is a glistening ten minutes of piano, harp and pouty, glossed lip cynicism.

""It's time to stop blocking these blessings / See, I just wanna grow into my greatness / I wish I had the time that you've taken.""

YouTube

Mulatto, ""No Hook""

Fed up with being underestimated, under pressure and under constant supervision, the Atlanta rapper departs from her usual fun-loving, cash-stacking turn-up to drop a relentless 32 bars. Mulatto covers everything from family drama and fake friends to flimsy deals and online trolls.

""She used to be my dawg, but now she telling all my business / If I could take it back, I wouldn't have been on television / 'Cause y'all won't let me grow up and accept the fact I'm winning / Brother in the penitentiary, it's a piece of me missing,"" Latto vents.

In the accompanying visual, Latto walks into a therapy session to air out all her frustrations only to find out she's the only one she can trust to talk to.

YouTube

Tom Misch & Yussef Dayes, ""Nightrider"" feat. Freddie Gibbs

After weeks of singles and snippets online, South East London's Tom Misch and Yussef Dayes finally unveil the full extent of their hip-hop, jazz, electronic fellowship with What Kinda Music, an album that obliterates genre and deliberate ricochets off convention.

""Nightrider,"" featuring a blessing on the track from Freddie Gibbs, sputters and glides along loose as hell without losing the handle on cruise control.

YouTube

Isaiah Rashad, ""Why Worry""

After staying fairly quiet following 2016's The Sun's Tirade, Isaiah Rashad made his laid-back reentry during TDE Appreciation Week. With an atmospheric sample of ""Why Worry"" by Dire Straits, the Chattanooga, Tenn. rhymer performs a lyrical tightrope walk, levitating over fake love, shallow gossip, writer's block and bills due.

In an alternate timeline, I know precisely how I would have spent the evening of April 17. The dynamic South African pianist Nduduzo Makhathini had been booked for an album-release engagement at Dizzy's Club, the in-house nightclub at Jazz at Lincoln Center. I was looking forward to hearing his band in that room — not only because Makhathini's stateside appearances are few and far between, but also because the urgent, questing spirit of his music is something best experienced in person and in close quarters, as a form of communion.

Here is how I spent the evening of April 17: At that point, one month into home quarantine, I had grown accustomed to the live stream as a plucky substitute for conventional performance. I was about to cue up one of those streams when I saw reports of the death of Giuseppi Logan, a multi-reedist who made his mark in free jazz. I'd just started writing Logan's obituary when my phone rang: A friend and fellow critic wanted to know whether I was working on an obit for the revered avant-garde bassist Henry Grimes. ""Oh no,"" I said. ""Henry too?""

April is Jazz Appreciation Month. As designated by the Smithsonian, it's usually marked by a joyous overspill of music in the clubs, in the classroom and across our cultural institutions. The coronavirus reset that agenda this year, to put it mildly. Among the many April events displaced by the pandemic were the NEA Jazz Masters ceremony, an official rite of commendation, and the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, a social and economic linchpin. Beyond that, ""jazz appreciation"" feels destabilizing and fraught in light of the month we've all just lived through. The phrase has acquired the serrated edge of an austerity measure, as spots like Dizzy's, and The Village Vanguard, and Constellation in Chicago — the essential habitat for this music, and not just for reasons of commerce — went dark with no end in sight. As an art form, this music fought hard for the institutional approval that Jazz Appreciation Month represents. In practical terms, the pomp and plaudits don't matter half as much as the organic bond that forms between musicians and an audience sharing physical space in real time. To appreciate jazz, at a moment like this, is to understand how comprehensively it has been silenced.

To a unique degree, jazz also venerates its elders, whose experience as pathfinders and pacesetters is rightly understood as an irreplaceable resource. So it was all the more devastating to absorb the mounting casualties, especially at mid-month. COVID-19 took Henry Grimes and Giussepi Logan that same week that it claimed the incorrigibly creative alto saxophonist Lee Konitz. These and other losses served as a reminder of some of the systemic vulnerabilities this pandemic has exposed, especially for the elderly, and the African American population in cities like New York, New Orleans and Detroit.

Unlike many other musical communities, in jazz, the stature of elders only grows, with deepening implications for the music. Mentorship still plays an important role in the music's evolution, and in many cases, our most seasoned artists remain in active circulation to the end: Konitz, who was 92 when he died, released a vital album within the last six months, and he leaves behind more than one generation of younger artists profoundly shaped by their time with him. Or think of New Orleans pianist Ellis Marsalis, who fell to COVID-19 on the first day of this month. His legacy flows through the countless musicians he taught and encouraged — beginning with his heirs, Branford and Wynton among them — but it's also true that a particular, embodied wisdom was lost when he passed on.

""I'm 80 years old, and I've never seen anything like this in my lifetime,"" pianist Herbie Hancock told me this week, speaking from his home in Los Angeles. He was referring broadly to the pandemic, but he doesn't need to be reminded of a jazz community in mourning. One early victim of the coronavirus was trumpeter Wallace Roney, who worked with Hancock on a Grammy-winning tribute to Miles Davis; Roney was 59 when he died, on the final day of March.

One of the other musicians I checked in with this month is pianist Orrin Evans, who recorded an album with Roney just a handful of days before the trumpeter entered the hospital. Evans had asked Bootsie Barnes, a veteran tenor saxophonist from his hometown of Philadelphia, to play on the same session, but due to a miscommunication, he never made it to the studio. ""Oh well, I'll get Bootsie on the next one,"" Evans told himself, but that chance will never come; Barnes died of COVID-19 on April 22. I think of this story when I consider the heartbreaking toll of April — the lives lost, first and foremost, but also the new connections and collaborations that went unrealized, the music that went unplayed. And on a selfish note, indelible experiences like the one I'm sure I would have had with Makhathini and his band, week after week, in that alternate timeline I'm finding increasingly difficult to imagine.

For the last eight years, Jazz Appreciation Month has culminated in International Jazz Day, a summit of performances, panels and workshops, with a gala all-star concert as its marquee event. Hancock created International Jazz Day in his dual capacity as a UNESCO goodwill ambassador and chairman of the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz (previously the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz). The event is held in a new host city every year; its 2020 edition was supposed to take place in Cape Town, South Africa. In an alternate timeline, musicians from some 50 countries would be there now, conducting workshops and master classes and preparing for the global all-star concert.

In our actual timeline, International Jazz Day is unfolding online, with a series of streaming programs leading up to the concert, which begins at 3 p.m. ET. (I'm moderating a panel discussion at 1:30.) The concert, featuring the likes of Dee Dee Bridgewater, Dianne Reeves, Sibongile Khumalo, Lizz Wright, Cécile McLorin Salvant, Jane Monheit and Youn Sun Nah — and those are just the distinguished female vocalists taking part — will have artists beaming in from their respective homes, in a pandemic-appropriate adaptation of the usual international convergence.

In South Africa, where jazz famously helped define the soundtrack of a freedom movement, it's no stretch to talk about this music as a light in the darkness. ""Our music in this current time brings some level of calmness, some level of peace, and some level of hope,"" Makhathini said last month, in a conversation with WBGO's The Checkout. ""And maybe this will also help us, as artists, to start being a bit more deliberate about how this healing is then channeled in our music."" Any student of jazz history will recognize a parallel in the music's African American root system, and the way it exemplifies grace under pressure — a quality that Albert Murray always fondly identified as the byproduct of elegance and resilience. Jazz has been a freedom music in its country of origin as well, from the early epiphanies of Louis Armstrong up through the rigorous ecstasies of Esperanza Spalding.

At the moment, there is heavy resonance in the idea of jazz as a force for good, just as there's reason to reconsider what we mean when we talk about the art of improvisation. At heart, improvisation shouldn't evoke the irresponsible word-salad of a politician at a podium, so much as the dauntless invention of a hospital staff that draws on the depth of their training to respond to an ever-changing crisis. It has been inspiring (but in no way surprising) to see musicians with instruments among the many routinely expressing gratitude to those on the coronavirus front line.

Hancock, a devout Buddhist, has a tendency to focus on the positive. He has always articulated the aim of International Jazz Day as an erasure of geopolitical and cultural divisions, and he sees all the more reason to embrace that message now. ""This virus is showing us that we are a species,"" he said. ""We are all human beings, and we all need to help each other, and we all need to work together. It's showing us, in a way, what we have in common. It's almost opening a pathway for what the future should be like.""

A world of uncertainty confronts us in the months ahead: What had initially registered as a shock to the worldwide jazz ecology is shaping up to be something deeper and more challenging. We've seen organizations like Jazz at Lincoln Center reorient around online offerings: concerts from the archive, educational outreach, even a socially distanced performance by its resident orchestra. We've seen a wave of philanthropic support from MusiCares, the Jazz Foundation of America, the Louis Armstrong Foundation and others. Musicians are doing what they can — applying for grants and relief; doing live streams; giving online lessons; promoting efforts like a petition for fairness in the digital marketplace. It's all crucially important. I'm painfully aware that it isn't enough.

At Hancock's direction, every edition of the International Jazz Day global concert has concluded with an all-hands-on-deck performance of ""Imagine,"" the John Lennon anthem. In some past years, I've regarded this finale, with its utopian pageantry and its awards-show pileup of well-meaning talent, as something to slog through rather than fully embrace — even when it comes with a few stirring highlights, as it did in Melbourne last year.

""Imagine"" will almost surely provide the customary finishing flourish to Jazz Day again this year, despite the abundant ridicule heaped upon Gal Gadot and her celebrity daisy chain in the early phase of self-quarantine. I have a hunch that hearing Hancock and his assembled peers perform the song — even in coordinated isolation, as a capstone to this most unusual Jazz Appreciation Month — will elicit more poignant feelings than usual. Hancock has a point when he observes how this pandemic underscores our connections as a human family, just as he's right to suggest that music can serve as a bridge. Many of us are primed to welcome the hope and healing of ""Imagine"" à la Jazz Day, and to reclaim its earnest sentiment as a worthy ideal. ""And the world will live as one"" is a lyric that can sound platitudinous, even simple-minded, until unexpected circumstances turn the world on its side.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/04/30/848140228/a-month-to-celebrate-jazz-turned-tragic

As an art form, sampling has been evolving for 35 years now. That's about how long ago it's been since the legendary producer Marley Marl revolutionized hip-hop production when, almost by accident, he figured out how to sample a drum beat from an existing record. It makes this a perfect time to look at the legacy, but also the trajectory, of sampling through a handful of snapshots.

The NPR Video team conceptualized this series, The Formula, that takes us into the home studios of several iconic producers, or producers of iconic songs, to talk about their approach to sampling and how they've evolved as producers. From talking to Just Blaze, 9th Wonder, DJ Dahi, DJ Premier and Salaam Remi, what we ended up discovering is so much more — the stories behind the music, yes, but also how they've kept sampling authentic but also vital in a genre where styles and trends change and transform faster than any other.

The fifth and final video will premiere on Saturday. In the meantime, we've also been asking some of our favorite writers to ""sample"" an element of each video themselves and spin it off in a new direction.

Sarah Knight has written a series of books offering advice on what she calls mental decluttering. It's a step she took when she pared her life to the essentials.

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:

Sarah Knight has built a career saying no, specifically, ""Expletive Deleted No!"" She is the author of the ""No Expletives Given Guides,"" which include the books ""Calm The Expletive Down"" and ""The Life Changing Magic Of Not Giving A Expletive."" And Sarah Knight's latest book, which I referenced at the top, offers advice on how to do what she calls mental decluttering in order to pare down life to the essentials. It's something we've all had to learn to do a lot more of recently. NPR's Samantha Balaban has this profile.

SAMANTHA BALABAN, BYLINE: At the end of a long, winding, tree-lined highway about two and a half hours outside of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic...

SARAH KNIGHT: This is my very favorite end of the beach - Las Ballenas beach in Las Terrenas.

BALABAN: There's a little beach town called Las Terrenas.

KNIGHT: (Speaking Spanish). A snack?

BALABAN: And that's where Sarah Knight sits, looking at the ocean eating fried plantains - or tostones.

KNIGHT: We've already got a friendly beach dog on the approach. This one's around here all the time.

BALABAN: Las Terrenas is a fishing village, and unlike other beachside towns in the country, there are few all-inclusive resorts here. It's cozy and isolated. For Sarah Knight, it's idyllic.

KNIGHT: I wake up when I wake up. I never set an alarm unless I have an appointment. Maybe I sit outside, depending on how hot it is. And if I'm working on a book or if I'm working on an article or something like that, I usually get started around noon.

BALABAN: Knight has written two self-help journals and four books here. She's working on a fifth right now.

KNIGHT: So walking back toward my house along the beach, it's about a half an hour walk from end to end.

BALABAN: She lives about a five-minute walk from the water with two feral cats named Gladys Knight and Mr. Stussy (ph) and her husband. They moved here almost four years ago.

KNIGHT: I was a senior editor at Simon & Schuster in New York. I'd been there for five years and at the other big six publishers for 10 years before that.

BALABAN: And she'd achieved a lot of success - award winners, bestsellers.

KNIGHT: And so I was at a real peak - or at least I was, you know, rising in terms of my professional life. But I just - every day, it was a struggle to get up, to get ready, to put on makeup, to put on heels, to get on the subway, to go to work. I started having a lot of panic attacks and some depression and some just real big questioning - existential - what am I doing with my life? And can I continue doing it in this place for these people until the end of time? And the answer was no.

BALABAN: So she saved up for a year and quit her job. In the process of clearing out her office, Knight brought home a copy of Marie Kondo's ""The Life-Changing Magic Of Tidying Up.""

KNIGHT: And I read it. And it really resonated. And it allowed me to explore this concept of mental decluttering, which is the core that runs through all of my books.

BALABAN: She describes mental decluttering as a two-step process, discarding and organizing.

KNIGHT: And you have to really sift through it all and go, why am I doing this? Why am I spending my time, energy and money on these things that I don't want to do with people I don't like with time I don't have? And after that, you organize your life around whatever's left. Part of what I've discovered and what I've heard from - you know, from readers over the last few years is that nobody was taking the time to just think for a second before saying yes and also thinking about if you really quote, unquote, ""have"" to do something.

BALABAN: Meeting her, you get the sense that Sarah Knight is someone who practices what she preaches. She says no all the time - to working for less money than she feels her time is worth, letting friends with kids stay at her house, pub trivia.

KNIGHT: I kept making excuses for years. And then finally, I said, you know what? Instead of just kind of weirdly batting back and forth excuses and things or saying yes and ending up spending, you know, six hours of a night doing something I don't want to do, I'll just say no. And then they're cool with it. And then it's fine, and your life goes on. If you are saying all of these yeses, then you're stretching yourself too thin, and you're not having fun. You're not enjoying yourself, and you're not being the best version of yourself among other people. I really would like to make sure that people understand this is not about just saying, [expletive] off, I don't care, I'm opting out of life. This is - it's really about opting in.

BALABAN: Sarah Knight is much happier since saying no to her old life and moving to the Dominican Republic. But she understands that, under normal circumstances, saying no even on a smaller scale can be really, really hard for a lot of people. Like everyone else, she's been quarantining for the past month and a half. And she's been thinking a lot about how having to social distance, not being able to go out, to say yes to things, to overbook ourselves is kind of like taking a crash course in her books. And maybe that's a silver lining.

KNIGHT: You know, I'm hopeful that we're all going to come out of this with some better perspective on what's important, what isn't. We're all going to have had some time to take a crack at cleaning out our mental barns, you know, and putting some things in the joy column and a lot of things in the annoy column and not letting them back in when the world opens up again. You know, I'm hopeful that we can just go out there and say no.

BALABAN: Sarah Knight says if this pandemic puts her out of business, so be it. Samantha Balaban, NPR News.

NASA has selected three companies to develop the first vehicle in more than 50 years to put humans on the moon, with space firms run by billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos among the competitors.

Musk's SpaceX, Bezos' Blue Origin and a third company, Dynetics, a Huntsville, Ala., subsidiary of Leidos, will share $967 million in development money from NASA to flesh out concepts for the landing component of the Artemis program, which the space agency hopes will get it back to the moon by 2024.

Two other companies that put in bids, Boeing and Vivace, were edged out.

""This is the first time since the Apollo era that NASA has direct funding for a human landing system, and now we have companies on contract to do the work for the Artemis program,"" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said, calling the lander the ""last piece that we need in order to get to the moon"" by 2024.

YouTube

The last American astronaut to walk on the moon was Apollo 17's Eugene Cernan, who left the last human bootprint there on Dec. 14, 1972, 2 1/2 years after Neil Armstrong's famous ""one small step.""

With Artemis, NASA has promised that the first woman will step foot on the lunar surface and there's already speculation on which of the space agency's veteran female astronauts might be the one.

Over the next 10 months, each of the three companies announced on Thursday will refine their concept and NASA will choose the most promising.

The competing concepts couldn't be more different. SpaceX's is based on its Starship rocket currently under development and resembles some of the pre-Apollo ideas about how astronauts would land on the moon, with one large rocket landing vertically on the surface.

The NASA news release does not specify award amounts, but here they are:



• $579 million to the Blue Origin team

• $253 million to the Dynetics-led team

• $135 million to SpaceX



NASA chief says awards to not reflect ranking or preference.https://t.co/XwrB4Xo5F2 — Eric Berger (@SciGuySpace) April 30, 2020

According to concept drawings, Blue Origin's lander would use the same basic idea as the old Apollo lunar module — a two-part vehicle that lands and then lifts off from the surface using the bottom portion as an expendable launch pad.

Both of those concepts, however, would require astronauts to descend from their spacecraft a fairly long way to the surface. Starship's crew compartment would be so high, in fact, that astronauts might be required to use an elevator to reach the moon.

By contrast, the Dynetics lander is low and would require astronauts to take only a few steps to reach the surface.

Blue Origin is reportedly getting more than half the development pie, $579 million, with Dynetics at $253 million and SpaceX trailing with $135 million.

NASA's planned Lunar Gateway, a vehicle in orbit around the moon with living quarters for astronauts, a science lab and docking ports for visiting spacecraft, won't be ready for the first landings but will be used later to achieve ""a regular cadence of missions using commercial services contracts later in the decade,"" NASA says.

In a teleconference with journalists, Musk enthused about the ""potential for an incredibly exciting future in space with a base on the moon and ultimately sending people and having a self-sustaining city on Mars.""

Dynetics' vice president of space systems, Kim Doering, said the company is excited about the first mission in 2024 but also about the longer-term development of the moon as a commercial venture.

Bob Smith, the CEO of Blue Origin, called it a historic day, saying that ""going to the moon is the reason why we got into this business.""

Later this month, NASA plans to launch two astronauts from Cape Canaveral, Fla., for the first time since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011 left the U.S. without its own human space-launch capability.

Updated on Friday at 7:36 p.m. ET

Most of the nation's airlines are beginning to require passengers to wear face coverings or masks on flights to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Southwest and Alaska Airlines announced Friday they will join American, Delta, United, Frontier and JetBlue in taking the action amid growing pressure from Congress and their own employees.

Flight attendants having been calling on their airlines and the federal government to require face coverings or masks on passengers since the pandemic began, and in recent weeks, some Democratic lawmakers have been urging the same, ramping up pressure on the Trump administration and the airlines to do more to protect travelers and employees from COVID-19.

The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents employees of United, Alaska, Frontier and 17 other airlines, says at least 300 of its members have contracted COVID-19 and several flight attendants have died. The union continues to call on the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services to mandate face coverings be worn by all travelers on flights and in airports.

The FAA has said it expects airlines to follow CDC recommendations that everyone wear face coverings when in public, but the regulatory agency has stopped short of requiring them.

Some airlines already require crew members to wear masks, and in addition to now requiring passengers to do the same, some airlines are blocking out middle seats, spacing out passengers during boarding and taking other steps to ensure social distancing on flights. They've stepped up their cleaning and disinfecting of airplane cabins, as well.

JetBlue was the first U.S. airline to require passengers to wear face masks, starting next week. ""Wearing a face covering isn't about protecting yourself, it's about protecting those around you,"" said JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty. ""This is the new flying etiquette.""

United and several other airlines will provide masks to those passengers who do not have them.

Asked why his airline didn't act sooner when the flight attendants union had been calling for such step for over a month, United Airlines spokesman Josh Earnest said it was a supply chain issue.

""We did not want to be in a position in which we are diverting medical supplies that were badly needed for medical professionals,"" Earnest said. ""Now that there is more inventory, we have been able to work through our supply chain to ensure that we can provide our customers with masks on May 4,"" when the new requirement takes effect.

Earnest would not say if the airline will deny boarding to passengers who refuse to wear a mask.

""We will be providing masks to all of our customers"" to make it easy for them to comply, he said. ""We do have language in our contract of carriage that will be updated, so we're going to be real clear about what the requirements are.""

Earnest added that social norms are changing to the new coronavirus realities, ""and I think those changing norms will carry over into the social environment on board an aircraft.""

Delta will make masks mandatory on Monday, too. Frontier's requirement goes into effect May 8, and American will require passengers to wear masks as of May 11.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/30/848856259/passengers-must-wear-masks-on-major-airlines-to-cut-spread-of-coronavirus

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that all city and county residents who want a coronavirus test can now get one for the first time since COVID-19 cases began appearing there in January.

Free COVID-19 testing is available to any L.A. County resident. https://t.co/13jZaOOegy — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) April 30, 2020

The announcement, which makes Los Angeles one of the first major cities in the nation to offer free testing to all its residents, came on the same day that county health officials reported a surge in the number of new COVID-19 cases, which they attributed in part to more widespread testing.

The Los Angeles County Health Department confirmed another 1,541 cases — its largest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic. It also reported 56 additional deaths because of the coronavirus.

Health officials say despite the uptick, the rate of hospitalization and death in the county has remained steady. Los Angeles County now has a total of nearly 22,500 confirmed cases — accounting for nearly half of California's more than 46,000.

Until now, because of a scarcity of test kits, only people showing symptoms of COVID-19, essential workers and those in institutional settings such as nursing homes could receive a test in Los Angeles.

Garcetti's announcement could be a significant milestone, because health officials say without widespread testing they are unable to accurately track the spread of the disease. That information could then be used to determine when it is safe to ease stay-at-home orders.

Now, any LA city or county resident who wants a test can make an appointment and get one at one of dozens of testing sites in the area, the mayor said at a news conference on Wednesday.

But he added that people showing symptoms would still be given priority for testing.

Garcetti said Los Angeles currently accounts for about 9% of all the tests nationwide.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sergii Iaremenko/Science Photo Library/Getty Images Sergii Iaremenko/Science Photo Library/Getty Images

States clamoring for coronavirus tests in recent weeks have been talking about two types.

First, there's a PCR test that detects the virus's genetic material and so can confirm an active infection. And then there's an antibody test, which looks at the body's reaction to that infection and so is useful in identifying people who have been infected with the virus in the past.

Now, there's a third kind of test under development to help fight COVID-19 that homes in on proteins that stud the virus's outer surface; it, too, detects an active infection. Known as an antigen test, this one could offer a much easier and more widely available alternative for diagnosis than the PCR test, proponents say, though some other scientists remain concerned about the test's reliability.

""We have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing,"" Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House coronavirus task force said recently on Meet the Press in her most recent pitch for antigen tests. ""We have to be able to detect antigen rather than constantly trying to detect the actual live virus or the viral particles itself.""

Though there are no authorized coronavirus antigen tests on the market yet, several companies are already working on them, including one that has started seeking a stamp of approval from the Food and Drug Administration.

""It's very exciting,"" says Lee Gehrke, a microbiologist at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is involved with E25BIO, a Cambridge, Mass., company developing the test. ""It could change the landscape for testing.""

OraSure Technologies Inc. of Bethlehem, Pa., is also developing an antigen test that would enable people to test themselves at home from a saliva sample.

""Having a rapid antigen — in-home — self-test will help both combat the virus and also individual fear,"" says Stephen Tang, the company's chief executive officer. ""It actually gives the individual a bit of control and understanding — whether they're infectious and whether family members are infectious. So I think it starts to get us back in a mindset where we can control our destiny.""

Public health experts agree that such a test could be very helpful.

""Rapid antigen tests would be valuable because of their speed,"" Tom Inglesby, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, wrote in an email.

But Inglesby and others caution that any antigen tests would have to be carefully vetted to make sure they're accurate. Relaxed oversight by the FDA recently has raised concerns about the reliability of some other kinds of tests — such as antibody tests — which are being marketed aggressively by some companies with unverified claims.

When used to look for other types of infections, such as testing for the flu, or for strep in someone with a sore throat, antigen tests have tended to miss more infected people than the PCR tests for the coronavirus typically do, experts say.

""We know an awful lot about the performance of antigen detection tests,"" says Frederick Nolte, who heads testing at the Medical University of South Carolina. ""And we know that that sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired.""

Generally, antigen tests tend to miss about 15 to 20% of infections, Nolte and others say, and that's likely not good enough for many uses of a diagnostic test for the coronavirus.

""If you're using this test to screen people to make sure that they're not infected, and that they go back to work or things like that, then you'd be giving people the message that they are not infected when actually they are — and therefore transmitting the new coronavirus,"" says Jesse Papenburg, an infectious disease expert at McGill University.

The tests currently used to see whether people are actively infected with the virus are sophisticated molecular tests that can spot its genetic material in specimens swabbed from inside people's noses and throats. Most use the technique known as polymerase chain reaction — PCR — to generate and analyze millions of copies of genetic sequences from the virus.

But those tests require sophisticated equipment, highly trained technicians and complicated processes that use specialized chemicals; those strict requirements of PCR tests, and problems in reliably meeting them, have contributed to the testing shortage.

Wide-scale testing is considered crucial for determining the scope of the pandemic, bringing it under control and keeping large new outbreaks from occurring. Testing enables public health authorities to spot new infections quickly so patients can be isolated and so anyone they might have had contact with.

Typically, antigen tests are much easier and less expensive to manufacture and simpler to perform than either PCR tests or antibody tests. The same technology is used in pregnancy tests.

""It looks very much like a pregnancy test. And they're very simple. They don't require special chemicals or training to use them. And they can give you a read out in about 15 minutes or so,"" says Gehrke, one of the collaborators on the E25BIO test.

Gehrke says his company's test appears to be very accurate when evaluated with samples of the virus in the lab.

""The difficult question — and the one we want to ask — is how well does it perform on samples from real patients,"" Gehrke says.

Papenburg questions whether antigen test could ever be as reliable as the genetic tests because, unlike those PCR tests, they can't produce large quantities of the target proteins — so might be more likely to miss an infection.

Tang says OraSure is also conducting careful studies to ensure the company's test would be reliable — able to not only detect an infection with the novel coronavirus, but also to quickly and accurately discern it from other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common cold.

""Our aiming point for our rapid antigen test is to make it highly sensitive and highly specific,"" Tang says, though he acknowledges that it remains to be seen how the test will compare to the molecular tests. It could turn out the antigen test's results would have to be confirmed by the PCR tests, Tang says.

Another company, Mologic in the United Kingdom, is developing an antigen test and hopes to get it approved by June, according to Fionna Tod, a company spokeswoman. The test would produce results in 10 minutes and would sell for about $1, she says, which could be very helpful in less affluent parts of the world.

In an email, the company's medical director, Joe Fitchett, noted that genetic tests often use samples gathered through an uncomfortable procedure that involves swabbing deep into the nose.

""PCR tests using nasal swabs can be deeply uncomfortable, and poor technique is well-documented to lead to false negatives,"" Fitchett says. ""On the other hand, saliva that can be deployed in a rapid antigen test and could offer better, more user-friendly performance — that will be critical for a self-test.""

During a briefing Wednesday announcing a $1.5 billion effort to speed the development of new coronavirus tests, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said it could be possible to develop reliable antigen tests.

""While traditionally, antigen-based tests have lower sensitivity and specificity than do nucleic acid tests, I don't believe there's any law of physics that says that has to be the case,"" Collins said.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/30/847416695/a-next-generation-coronavirus-test-raises-hopes-and-concerns

If The Trees Can Keep Dancing, So Can I

What I'm learning about grief

is that it sits in the space between laughs

comes in the dark steals the warmth from the bed covers threads sleep with thin tendrils

is a hauntingly familiar song,

yet I can't remember the words...

What I'm learning about grief

is that it rolls like a heavy mist settles into the crevices lingers on the skin.

Visits, then visits again

Lurking under my chair.

And, when I'm not watching

Reaches out her tiny claws

And bats my ankles —

Grief sneaks up on you.

You find yourself on your couch with a well of rage living in the pit of your stomach and nowhere for it to go.

And, It chokes you.

What I'm learning about grief,

is that it can come like a whisper or storm through loud as thunder

it leaves a hollow, to be filled with a new planting.

And, when you wake for another day that feels oddly the same as the last, It crawls right back into your lap.

an ocean of tears So, you vary the crawl with the butterfly, the backstroke with breaststroke. At some point, drowning is no longer an option.

What I'm learning about grief

Is that it is a language.

Suffering is its own speech

it will not go away just because you won't look it in the eye

He rides shotgun when you go by old familiar places

Eventually, you will get closer and he will say

""See, it's not so bad. I got your back.""

This pandemic, this tragedy, this fulcrum of life is a shovel unearthing secrets we wish would stay buried I learn that I am ashamed I love solitude.

Hard times call for soft people. There is softness in stillness, in staying home, in distractions deleted, in a togetherness that stretches great distances.

What I'm learning about grief

is not found in mint leaves, floating in a glass of tears boiled thrice over.

It is an acquired taste which we never crave

It likes nachos

Staying up late

Watching Scandinavian murder shows

Sleeping in

And eating cake for breakfast.

it drips, like water, It gets in everywhere

through the small unseen fissures in the ceiling. You can ignore it like dust.

Just keep yourself too busy with laundry and living.

Grief shows up unannounced

Like when your husband tells you last October

That he's never loved you

And wants permission to leave

So you burrow the ache into carefully guarded well

And wonder if that means the memories have to go there too

What I'm learning about grief

is that it can turn you into someone you don't want to be, can help you become someone you never thought you could be

is that it transcends color, race, Religion, gender.

is that it's an old lover that won't leave. trying to hold your hand again –

that it aches in the arches of feet

that its mother is loss, its father, change

Make room for it.

Is that tiny losses add up

The missed first party my son was to attend

The school days he yearns for with his friends I tell him it will be over soon

What I'm learning about grief

I learned a long time ago.

Knead grief, as you would bread.

Weave grief, as you would thread.

there is no vaccine against it — we can't develop antibodies against it, it is something I have and something you have — but in these times it is something we have

It is anger and denial

It is chaotic laughter from splintered memories

It is jagged cries and single tears

It is numb and indifferent

It is the pinprick of light, promising

A slow semblance of normality returned

What I'm learning about grief

Is to acknowledge its presence

Its many forms and guises

Then, to use it, while reaching out

Connected To everyone who is braving this same storm

What I'm learning about grief is that it is still learning about me

Learning that I am strong and resilient

If the trees can keep dancing,

So can I.

['Nurith Aizenman'],2020-04-29,Why The U.S. Government Stopped Funding A Research Project On Bats And Coronaviruses,"Why The U.S. Government Stopped Funding A Research Project On Bats And Coronaviruses

This post was updated at 10:50 a.m. ET on May 1.

The U.S. government has suddenly terminated funding for a years-long research project in China that many experts say is vital to preventing the next major coronavirus outbreak.

The project was run by a U.S. nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance. For more than a decade, the group has been sending teams to China to trap bats, collect samples of their blood, saliva and feces, and then check those samples for new coronaviruses that could spark the next global pandemic. The idea is to identify locations that need to be monitored, come up with strategies to prevent spillover of the virus into human populations and get a jump on creating vaccines and treatments. Already the project has identified hundreds of coronaviruses, including one very similar to the virus behind the current outbreak.

But since early this month, U.S. officials have been working to raise suspicions about a key collaborator on the project: the Wuhan Institute of Virology, located in the city where the outbreak began. U.S. intelligence officials are investigating whether the coronavirus escaped from the Wuhan Institute through some sort of contamination accident. As noted in an NPR story published last week, many scientists have discounted that theory as nearly impossible.

Nonetheless, at an April 17 news conference, President Trump said he had given instructions to check if any U.S. funding was slated for the Wuhan Institute, and if so, he said, it would immediately be terminated. Days later, on April 24, the National Institutes of Health, or NIH — which was providing the grant for the project — notified EcoHealth Alliance that the money was being canceled, as first reported by Politico.

To learn more about the cutoff of funds and the possible impact on coronavirus research, NPR interviewed the president of EcoHealth Alliance, Peter Daszak, as well as Robert Garry, a microbiologist at Tulane University who is playing a prominent role in COVID-19 research but who does not work with the nonprofit. (NPR reached out to both NIH and the White House for comment. The White House referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH. A spokesman for the department did not respond to a request for comment. NIH provided a statement to NPR confirming that the grant has been terminated, adding that ""NIH does not discuss details of the decision-making process regarding specific grant awards.""

Here are the answers we got to four key questions:

Who approved funding for this project?

At the April 17 White House news conference, a reporter mischaracterized key details about the project, stating that ""the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant"" and asking Trump, ""Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?""

Trump continued that erroneous depiction, answering, ""I understand it was a number of years ago, right?"" Then he added, ""2015? Who was president then, I wonder.""

In fact, while the first grant for the project was indeed given in 2015 (for $3.25 million over five years, of which nearly $3.1 million was ultimately disbursed), the $3.7 million was approved last year as a five-year renewal.

Also, only about 10% of the grant — about $76,000 per year — was slated for the Wuhan Institute. This was provided in recognition that the Wuhan lab was doing the bulk of the on-the-ground sample collection and analysis, says EcoHealth Alliance's Daszak.

""You can't just turn up as an American and say, 'I want to find out what viruses you've got,' "" says Daszak. ""You have to work with local collaboration and with the permission of the governments.""

Daszak adds that NIH approved the five-year renewal unusually quickly. ""When you submit those grants, they get reviewed independently by scientists, and they're assigned a score,"" says Daszak. ""We received a really extremely high priority for funding.""

What results has the project yielded so far?

Daszak says the China bat sampling project has already racked up quite a number of successes. The team and its collaborators at the Wuhan Institute of Virology have collected about 15,000 samples from bats. From these they have already identified about 400 wholly new coronaviruses. About 50 of those fall into a category that caused the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and, now, the COVID-19 pandemic.

The researchers were also able to demonstrate that at least some of the new bat coronaviruses they have found are capable of infecting a human cell in a petri dish. Then the team sampled the blood of people in China who live near various bat caves. They found evidence that for some time now, these bat coronaviruses have been spilling over into the human population.

""Our work has shown that between 1 [million] and 7 million people a year are exposed in rural China and rural Southeast Asia to these viruses,"" says Daszak.

""It really gives us a forward look at what could be coming down the pike.""

Indeed, once the current pandemic began, the Wuhan Institute researchers on the project were able to consult their library of bat coronaviruses. They found an extremely close match.

All this work makes EcoHealth Alliance a ""major player"" in the field, says Garry, the microbiologist at Tulane. ""These are notable papers that people will be citing going forward.""

How did funding for the project unravel so quickly?

Almost as soon as the pandemic began, conspiracy theories started circulating, pointing to the Wuhan Institute of Virology as the culprit. In recent weeks, these have gained traction with the revelation that U.S. intelligence agencies are assessing the possibility of a lab accident, as well as with the leak of State Department cables obtained by The Washington Post indicating that in 2018, officials had raised safety concerns about the Wuhan lab. Trump and other Republican figures have used these points in a broader narrative that they are advancing, blaming China for the pandemic.

EcoHealth Alliance's Daszak says his first ""inkling"" of the impact that this would have on funding for the China research project came in a series of emails from NIH that began shortly after Trump's April 17 press conference. In the first email, ""they said, 'Can you not send funds to the Wuhan Institute of Virology?' "" he recalls. ""We wrote back straight away and said, 'Of course we won't [fund them]. Absolutely.' ""

In another email, on April 23, he says NIH expressed its thanks.

The very next day, on Friday, April 24, he received another email from NIH informing him that the funding for the China bat coronavirus project had been eliminated because ""at this time NIH does not believe the current project outcomes align with the program goals and agency priorities.""

This was particularly mystifying, Daszak says, because just a day earlier, NIH had released a strategic plan detailing COVID-19 research priorities. ""Our work is relevant to all four priority areas within that strategic plan,"" says Daszak.

""We really don't understand the rationale behind this,"" he says. ""And we've reached out to NIH and have not received a response yet.""

Garry of Tulane says it is ""highly unusual"" for NIH to halt funding for a project this way. ""Scientifically this doesn't make sense. Scientists should be able to work with other scientists without politics.""

What happens to the research that the project was doing?

The China bat research project was funded entirely through the NIH grant, says Daszak. ""So with the funding terminated, we won't be able to do this work. The fieldwork will not carry on.""

That poses a threat to U.S. national security and public health, he says. ""Once this pandemic is over, we know of hundreds of other coronaviruses that we've found evidence of in China that are waiting to emerge,"" says Daszak. ""We are now going to be unable to know about the risk of that, which puts us completely at risk of the next pandemic.""

At a minimum, EcoHealth — and the many international researchers to whom it provides information — will no longer have the ability to study the vast collection of new coronavirus samples already collected. ""They're in freezers in China. We had free and open access while we were doing this collaboration to get the genetic sequences of the virus from those samples. But without the funding, we won't be able to get that.""

Another part of the project that won't be able to continue: Over the next four years, Daszak says, they were going to dig deeper into how communities in rural China are getting exposed to coronaviruses. ""We have anthropologists that try to understand which human behaviors are most likely to cause those viruses to emerge. We designed programs to help reduce those behaviors — things like the wildlife trade — and to try to persuade governments and communities to do things in a less risky way.""

Finally, EcoHealth Alliance will have to forgo its plans to collect many more samples to expand the database of novel coronaviruses.

That's a serious missed opportunity, he says, because ""the genetic sequences of the viruses we find in wildlife are given to labs here in the U.S. — who then work to incorporate them into vaccines and drug designs so that we can be better prepared if there's an emergence.""

Already, he adds, at least one of the teams researching a treatment to help in the current pandemic — a group based at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill — has been testing a drug called EIDD-2801 against not just COVID-19 but against several of the other bat coronaviruses that the EcoHealth Alliance project helped identify.

After all, says Daszak, ideally drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 will be designed to work on a ""broader spectrum"" of similar viruses — because, he says, it's only a matter of time before one of those sparks another outbreak.

Not all scientists think that's achievable. But Tulane's Garry agrees it's a reasonable — if challenging — goal. ""It's entirely possible to come up with a universal anti-coronavirus vaccine,"" he says. ""That's the hope. It's aspirational. But to do that we would need to know what the diversity of the coronavirus species are.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/29/847948272/why-the-u-s-government-stopped-funding-a-research-project-on-bats-and-coronaviru

The U.S. Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort is scheduled to depart New York City on Thursday after deploying there to help with the coronavirus pandemic.

U.S. Northern Command announced on Tuesday that the Comfort, which arrived in Manhattan on March 30, would return to its berth in Norfolk, Va.

Other military personnel, ships, aircraft and facilities will remain involved in the disaster response, and the Comfort itself will continue to stand by.

""Even as USNS Comfort departs NYC, the ship and its embarked medical task force remain prepared for future tasking,"" the statement said. ""The Navy, along with other U.S. Northern Command dedicated forces, remains engaged throughout the nation in support of the broader COVID-19 response.""

There was no immediate information about a prospective second deployment for the Comfort or whether the ship might sail to another destination within the United States or somewhere abroad. The Comfort often undertakes medical missions to the Caribbean, Central American and elsewhere.

The ship's roughly 1,000 patient beds were first to be used as spillover capacity for non-coronavirus sufferers in greater New York, with the idea that they would free up space on land for pandemic victims.

Later, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and public health officials asked that the ship, which had not seen many cases, begin taking suspected pandemic patients, the first of which came aboard on April 6. There was no immediately available accounting about how many total patients the Comfort accommodated during its deployment to New York.

The Comfort's sibling, the West Coast-based hospital ship USNS Mercy, deployed to Los Angeles to help with the pandemic there. The crew of the Mercy also had to try to manage a COVID-19 outbreak among its own personnel.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/28/847457974/hospital-ship-usns-comfort-scheduled-to-sail-from-new-york-city

For nearly three years, Mark Green led the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in delivering foreign aid to countries in need during times of crisis, including the coronavirus pandemic.

In mid-March, Green announced that he was stepping down and taking on a new position as executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership. President Trump has asked John Barsa, part of the USAID leadership team, to take over as acting administrator.

NPR's Rachel Martin spoke with Green, a former Republican congressman from Wisconsin and U.S. ambassador to Tanzania, about the value of U.S. foreign assistance, his outlook on how developing countries will face the pandemic and what the future may hold for USAID.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Were you reticent at all to leave your job in the middle of this pandemic? I know it had been in the works, but even so, did you pause?

Over the course of a number of weeks when we first saw the epidemic, we began to take steps at USAID to craft the framework that we're now implementing in our work.

We stood up a crisis action team [for coronavirus], and then we moved to create an internal task force led by Ken Staley, who in his day job leads the President's Malaria Initiative. So I feel like we've got the right people at the right time at USAID to lead in that portion of the response to the pandemic.

But the other piece of this is that as we get through to the other side [of the crisis] — hopefully sooner than later — I'm really trying to dedicate myself to help build the kind of leadership that we need around the world to prepare against future shocks and crises. And that's the reason why I joined the McCain Institute, is to try to foster that kind of leadership.

So what does that look like? I mean, what is American leadership? What does it appear to be to you right now and what should it be?

I think the great lesson that we've seen from the coronavirus outbreak in some ways is strikingly similar to the lesson that we learned the hard way not so long after 9/11. We have to care about what takes place in the far reaches of the world.

I was elected to Congress in '98, and I remember not so long after 9/11 thinking to myself that if you would have told me that we would, in a remote corner of Afghanistan, really see a set of actions that resulted in 3,000 people being killed in New York — I'd have said, ""You're crazy.""

That same thing is true here. We have to care about what takes place in Asia, in Africa, because if we don't — if we're not engaged, if we're not building capacity in these countries — sadly, the challenges will come to us.

You have said that the spread of COVID-19 underscores the importance of investing in foreign aid and global health programs. Yet the White House is looking to cut funding to the World Health Organization. Does that concern you?

There is no doubt that the World Health Organization made some missteps early on. The World Health Organization has said that.

But the advantage of the World Health Organization for the U.S. government and for the American people is that they're able to work in places that are often difficult for us — insecure settings, places where we don't want to post Americans for a range of reasons. So an effective World Health Organization is important for our interests as much as the interests of other countries and other peoples.

President Trump has made clear for a very long time, even as a candidate, that he didn't have faith in international organizations and that, frankly, the U.S. should rethink its role in the world. As someone who believes that we should be paying attention and concern ourselves with all the corners of the world, how do you make sense of that?

There's no doubt that President Trump, that the White House [are] skeptics of foreign assistance and skeptics of multilateral organizations and there's nothing wrong with a healthy skepticism. When I was first asked about coming into the Trump administration, I remember meeting with president-elect Donald Trump, and he was asking me about the value of foreign assistance. And I said, ""You know, look, Mr. President-elect. I believe that if we do this right, if our foreign assistance is spent wisely, effectively and efficiently, we can take on the challenges that you see that were an important part of American leadership and American foreign policy.""

That's what we try to do at USAID, what I tried to do in my tenure there and I think it's important that we're always thinking in those terms. I think Americans are traditionally skeptical of foreign assistance and in working with international organizations. But I think as we look carefully at these investments, we'll see that they're wise, that in the long run, they're good for our security. They actually are good for our economy. They save us money in the long run, and I think they're important part of who we are as a people.

President Trump proposed slashing foreign aid by 21% in February of this year. Did that make your job harder?

At USAID and at other parts of the foreign assistance apparatus, our job is always to spend money as effectively and efficiently as we can. When we receive less funding, we can do less of that. Our job is to make the money go as far as it can. But make no mistake, when we face deep cuts, that means we have to make hard choices and things necessarily get set aside. And from my point of view, that's unfortunate.

One program that was reportedly cut was a USAID program called Predict. This was an initiative aimed at identifying and preventing animal viruses that might someday infect humans. Given what we know about the origins of COVID-19 at this point, was it a mistake to end funding for that kind of early warning program?

Well, I'm a little bit dated now, having been out of USAID for a couple of weeks. It's important to know that it wasn't cut, that it did come to the end of a contract that had been extended a number of times. And I do know that USAID is working with partners to actually recalibrate and build the successor to it.

I'm very proud of the investments that USAID has made, particularly looking at zoonotic diseases — those that move potentially from animals to humans. I'm also proud of the work that we've done against wildlife trafficking, which is oftentimes a driver of these risks. So the investments that we've made have made a huge difference and built capacity in places where it did not exist. We believe very much in a science- and technology-based approach, and I'm confident that we'll continue to build programs in that regard.

Do you think that America's alliances have frayed over the last few years?

I think they've been tested. I think we've had tough conversations. Again, nothing wrong with that. But, you know, I'm one of those who believes in our alliances. I believe that we're much stronger when we work closely together with our friends and allies on matters of mutual concern.

To the president's credit, he's asking tough questions about the model of foreign assistance that China, Russia, Iran and Turkey offer — more authoritarian models. But at the end of the day, I believe that our foreign assistance is well invested, well-spent and transparently, effectively outcome-oriented. I'm confident of how it lifts lives and helps make the American people stronger and safer.

What are your concerns as as we watch the pandemic start to unfold in developing countries?

In many cases, these countries lack some of the basic tools of an effective response, and I know that we — being the global community, from the United States to our allies — are trying to help with that. But to contain an outbreak, a pandemic, you need effective communications with your people so there's clarity around the steps that can be taken to prevent further spread of the disease and to make sure the treatment, when available, is applied effectively. That's often difficult in many of these countries.

It's also important to build the kind of citizen-centered, citizen-responsive governance that gives people confidence that their leaders, that their governments are well-equipped to take on the challenge.

Those are two key elements that we need to work on with our partners in many parts of the world to make sure not only that we're able to help contain and defeat the current outbreak, but to stop the reemergence of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in the future.

What is the most important thing that USAID should do in this crisis right now?

It's no one thing — it's a lot of things. So first off, the United States government and USAID are the largest sources of humanitarian assistance in the world. During these times, we continue that leadership role with emergency medical supplies, emergency food assistance. We need to move effectively and efficiently to parts of the world where people are hurting.

Secondly, we need to make sure that the supply lines that enable us to get medical assistance during these challenging times are clear and effective. That's obviously challenging in the face of all of the transportation challenges that emerged during a pandemic like this.

I think finally, it's listening carefully to our partner country leaders on the ways that we can respond to the needs that they identify. So that's a crucial part of what USAID does. We're not transactional. We build relationships. We strengthen leadership and we respond to those with identified needs. So that's the approach and the role that USAID plays during these important times.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/29/847359224/exiting-usaid-chief-on-the-pandemic-foreign-aid-trumps-policies

Opioid addiction isn't taking a break during the coronavirus pandemic.

But the U.S. response to the viral crisis is making addiction treatment easier to get.

Under the national emergency declared by the Trump administration in March, the government has suspended a federal law that required patients to have an in-person visit with a physician before they could be prescribed drugs that help quell withdrawal symptoms, such as Suboxone. Patients can now get those prescriptions via a phone call or videoconference with a doctor.

Addiction experts have been calling for that change for years to help expand access for patients in many parts of the country that have shortages of physicians eligible to prescribe these medication-assisted treatments. A federal report in January found that 40% of U.S. counties don't have a single health care provider approved to prescribe buprenorphine, an active ingredient in Suboxone.

A 2018 law called for the new policy, but regulations were never finalized.

""I wish there was another way to get this done besides a pandemic,"" says Dr. David Kan, chief medical officer of Bright Heart Health, a Walnut Creek, Calif., company. It has recently started working with insurers and health providers to help addicted patients get therapy and medications without having to leave their homes. He said he hopes the administration will make the changes permanent after the national emergency ends.

Years before the emergency regulations were issued, Bright Heart — along with several other telemedicine counseling providers — began offering opioid addiction treatment and counseling via telemedicine, even if they couldn't prescribe initial medication for addiction. Patients can renew prescriptions for drugs to deal with withdrawal symptoms, get drug-tested and meet with counselors for therapy.

When Nathan Post needed help overcoming a decade-long drug addiction, he went online in 2018 and used Bright Heart Health to connect to a doctor and weekly individual and group counseling sessions. He says the convenience is a big benefit.

""As an addict, it was easy to have excuses not to do stuff, but this was easy because I could just be in my living room and turn on my computer, so I had no reason to blow it off,"" he says.

Post, 38, a tattoo artist who recently moved from New Mexico to Iowa City, Iowa, was addicted to Suboxone, the drug he was prescribed in 2009 to deal with an addiction to opioid pills.

Officials with the insurer Anthem say Bright Heart's telemedicine option has helped increase medication-assisted treatment for members with opioid drug abuse issues from 16% to more than 30% in California and nine other states. While fewer than 5% of Anthem patients seeking addiction treatment use telemedicine, the company expects the option to become more common.

One barometer of the effectiveness of the care, Bright Heart Health officials say, is that 90% of patients are still in treatment after 30 days and 65% after 90 days — far higher than with traditional treatment.

Several insurers across the country — including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield companies such as Anthem — have begun covering the telemedicine addiction service.

Dr. Miriam Komaromy, medical director of Boston Medical Center's Grayken Center for Addiction, says there are some downsides to virtual care.

""I think therapists and providers do worry whether it provides the same level of engagement with the patient and whether it's possible to gauge someone's sincerity and level of motivation as easily over a camera as in person,"" she says.

Nonetheless, she predicts telemedicine service will grow because of the tremendous need to broaden access to mental health and addiction counseling. ""Too often the default is no counseling for patients,"" she said. ""This gives us another set of tools.""

Patients can also have trouble finding a doctor who is eligible to prescribe medication to help treat addiction. Physicians are required to get a federal license to prescribe Suboxone and other controlled substances that help patients with opioid addiction, and they can write only limited numbers of prescriptions each month. Many doctors hesitate to seek that qualification.

A few small studies have found that patients are as likely to stay with telemedicine treatment as with in-person care for drug addiction. But no studies have determined whether one type of therapy is more effective.

Telemedicine does have its limits, and it is not right for everyone, particularly patients who require more intensive inpatient care or who lack easy Internet access, Komaromy says.

Premera Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials say they are partnering with Boulder Care, a digital recovery program based in Portland, Ore., to help customers in rural Alaska. ""Telemedicine is a unique way for someone to go through treatment in a discreet manner,"" says Rick Abbott, a Premera vice president.

While telemedicine has been growing in popularity for physical medicine, some people may still be reluctant to use it for drug addiction.

There are also concerns that allowing providers to prescribe controlled substances without meeting patients in person could increase the risk of fraud.

""There is a fear around this that there may be some rogue providers who make a lot of money off addiction and will do it stealthily on the Internet,"" says Dr. Alyson Smith, an addiction medicine specialist with Boulder Care. ""While that is a small risk, we have to compare it to the huge benefit of expanding treatment that will save lives.""

Smith says she doesn't notice a big difference in treating patients for drug addiction in her office compared with on a video screen. She can still see patients' pupils to make sure they are dilated and ask patients about how they are feeling — physical and emotional signs that can help determine whether it's appropriate to prescribe certain drugs. Dilated pupils are a sign of patients suffering from withdrawal from heroin and other drugs.

Dr. Dawn Abriel, who treated Post and previously directed a methadone clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., says she can diagnose patients over video without issue.

""I can pick up an awful lot on the video,"" particularly a patient's body language, she says. ""I think people open up to me more because they are sitting in their homes and in their place of comfort.""

In West Virginia, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid addiction epidemic, Highmark, a Blue Cross Blue Shield company, started offering telehealth addiction coverage with Bright Heart Health in January. Highmark officials say a lack of health providers, particularly in rural parts of the state, meant that many of the insurer's members had difficulty finding the help they needed.

Dr. Caesar DeLeo, vice president and executive medical director of strategic initiatives for Highmark, says the insurer had been having problems getting customers into care. Only about a third of members with addiction issues were receiving treatment, he says.

""We needed to address the crisis with a new approach,"" DeLeo says. ""This will give people more options and give primary care doctors who do not want to prescribe Suboxone another place to refer patients.""

DeLeo says patients will also be referred to Bright Heart in hospital emergency rooms.

Dr. Paul Leonard, an emergency doctor and medical director for Workit Health, an Ann Arbor, Mich., company offering telemedicine treatment and counseling programs, says many patients who turn to ERs for addiction treatment get little help finding counseling.

With online therapy, patients can sign up while still in the ER.

""We've built a better mousetrap,"" Leonard says.

Providers who specialize in addiction medicine and have recently turned to telemedicine say they and their patients are getting more accustomed to virtual care.

""There are always times you wish you could reach out and hold someone's hand, and you can't do that,"" says Boulder's Smith. ""But we feel like we are more skilled at a virtual hand-holding and really connect with people — and they feel well supported in return.""

Germany is backing away from a centralized digital contact tracing program it had been considering to combat the coronavirus, saying the effort will only work if people trust that their privacy is being respected.

German officials had planned to collect data from users' cellphones and store the data in a central repository. That approach would give health officials greater access to information that could help slow the spread of the coronavirus. But it troubled privacy advocates, who worry about a slippery slope if the government has access to so much personal information about citizens' interactions.

Over the weekend, governmental ministers reversed course, saying the country would move to a decentralized approach.

""This app should be voluntary, meet data protection standards and guarantee a high level of IT security,"" Chancellery Minister Helge Braun and Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a statement, according to Reuters. ""The main epidemiological goal is to recognize and break chains of infection as soon as possible.""

Contact tracing works by identifying anyone that an infected individual has come into contact with, and then notifying people who might have been exposed. Apple and Google announced earlier this month they are creating a tracing system that uses cellphones' ability to detect nearby phones via Bluetooth.

Apple and Google are taking what is known as a decentralized approach, in which all the potentially identifying information is stored locally, on users' phones.

The centralized system originally preferred by German officials would have required Apple to change the settings on its phones to allow for the collection of information. Reuters, citing a ""senior government source,"" says Germany backtracked after Apple refused to make that change.

Earlier this month, hundreds of academics from around the world warned of the potential consequences of unchecked automatic contact tracing.

""We are concerned that some 'solutions' to the crisis may, via mission creep, result in systems which would allow unprecedented surveillance of society at large,"" said a letter signed by nearly 300 professors around the globe.

""Solutions which allow reconstructing invasive information about the population should be rejected,"" they wrote, warning that a state, the private sector or hackers could use that data to spy on citizens.

The European Parliament supports a decentralized approach, and it has cautioned that there is a ""potential risk of abuse"" if data is stored in a centralized database.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says that the island nation has defeated — for the present — the coronavirus as her government announced the lifting of some restrictions imposed to halt the spread of COVID-19.

""There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,"" Ardern said Monday. ""But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.""

Asked whether New Zealand had eliminated COVID-19, Ardern replied: ""currently.""

The coronavirus has been trending down in New Zealand since April 5, when 89 confirmed cases were announced. On Sunday, there were no new cases announced for the first time in weeks, but another five were reported on Monday. A total of 19 people have died in New Zealand from COVID-19.

The country's director-general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said the small number of new cases in recent days ""does give us confidence that we have achieved our goal of elimination.""

Bloomfield and Ardern said that declaring the virus eliminated did not mean there would be no new cases, but that the numbers would be manageable with the help of aggressive contact tracing, which the prime minister said had been scaled up ""significantly"" with the capacity to make up to 10,000 calls per day.

Ardern's remarks came as New Zealand, a country of just 5 million people, downgraded its COVID-19 alert to level 3 — meaning most, but not all, businesses are being allowed to reopen.

Businesses and professions that require face-to-face contact — such as hairdressers, salespeople, masseuses and public gyms — will remain closed until the alert level is reduced another notch, Ardern said.

""Your business must be contactless. Your customers can pay online, over the phone or in a contactless way,"" she said. ""Delivery or pickup must also be contactless.""

Exceptions include supermarkets, dairies, gas stations, pharmacies or other permitted health services, according to the New Zealand Herald.

For those who return to the physical workplace, they should maintain 1 meter (about 3 feet) of social distancing, Ardern said.

""COVID-19 has spread in workplaces, so the quid pro quo of being able to open is doing it in a way that doesn't spread the virus,"" she said.

The prime minister also advised that if people can work from home, they should continue to do so.

New Zealand has garnered praise for largely putting aside politics in order to tackle the outbreak.

As NPR's Julie McCarthy reports, Ardern, 39, a mother of a 21-month-old, ""regularly appears on Facebook Live chats, dressed in a sweatshirt, commiserating with families enduring isolation in their 'bubble,' as she calls their place of shelter, and assuring children the tooth fairy is still on the job. When she imposed stringent stay-home rules in late March, she urged people to 'be strong and be kind.' ""

Australia has also seen a precipitous decline in new cases since a peak nearly a month ago.

Speaking on Sunday, Australia's home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, suggested that New Zealand and Australia could reopen travel between them even as restrictions on inbound air passengers from other countries remained.

""You could look at an arrangement with New Zealand given they're at a comparable stage as we are in the fight against this virus,"" Dutton told Sky News, as reported by Radio New Zealand. ""You could look at other nations in our region if they've enjoyed the same success, but New Zealand might be the natural partner.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/27/845304917/new-zealand-says-it-has-won-battle-against-covid-19

Sweden's ambassador to the U.S. believes the country's controversial strategy of imposing only limited restrictions — and not locking down the country — is bearing success, with the capital, Stockholm, on course to reach herd immunity in the next few weeks.

""About 30% of people in Stockholm have reached a level of immunity,"" Karin Ulrika Olofsdotter told NPR. ""We could reach herd immunity in the capital as early as next month.""

Herd immunity means the majority of a given population has become immune to an infectious disease either by recovering from it or through vaccination. Some researchers have put the threshold for coronavirus herd immunity at 60% in some areas.

There is no scientific proof, however, that people who have recovered from COVID-19 are actually protected from a second infection. The World Health Organization on Friday said the idea that one-time infection can lead to immunity remains unproven.

Olofsdotter agreed that more research and testing are needed to answer the lingering question regarding immunity. The Swedish government is ready to change its strategy should the situation require it, but there are currently no plans to switch course, she said.

Schools, restaurants and malls have remained open in Sweden. The government has issued social distancing guidelines, discouraged nonessential travel and recommended that people over 70 stay at home. Authorities also banned gatherings of more than 50 people, and visits to nursing homes are prohibited.

While the vast majority of Swedes approve of and follow the government's guidelines, reports suggest that Stockholm's residents have begun to break the rules as the weather gets warmer. The government swiftly responded by threatening to shut down any restaurant or bar that fails to implement adequate social distancing.

""I don't want to see any full open-air restaurants in Stockholm or anywhere else. Otherwise, businesses will be closed,"" Swedish Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg said on Friday.

According to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University, there are more than 18,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in Sweden, with 2,194 deaths as of Sunday.

These numbers don't bode well when compared with those of other Nordic countries. Denmark, which this month relaxed some of its restrictions, is closing in on 8,800 coronavirus cases. Its death toll stands at 422. Finland recently extended its ban on mass gatherings through the summer. The country has more than 4,500 confirmed cases and has reported 190 coronavirus deaths. Denmark and Finland have a population of around 5 million each, which is roughly half of Sweden's.

""We share the same goal as all other countries, and that is of course to save as many lives as possible and protect public health,"" Olofsdotter said. ""So we face the same reality as everyone else. But what's different — and I think it's important to underline that all countries are different — is that politicians take the measures that they think works best for their country and their general public.""

More than half of all deaths in Sweden have occurred in elderly care homes, Dr. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist at Sweden's Public Health Agency, told CNBC on Thursday. The government is investigating the causes behind the high mortality at the nation's nursing homes.

""Once we know how the virus got into our elderly care facilities, the government can make recommendations and take measures to try to stop that, because that is the biggest tragedy of all this, that it has gotten into the nursing homes,"" Olofsdotter told NPR.

The ambassador said the decision to keep restaurants, shops and schools open during the crisis could potentially speed up Sweden's economic recovery, but she made clear that businesses and employees have been suffering under the pandemic.

""Our unemployment, which was about 6.5% before, is now roughly around 11% and growing,"" she said. ""This is, of course, extremely serious, and we expect that our GDP will shrink between 4-10% for 2020.""

European Union leaders last week failed to reach a deal on an economic recovery program for its 27 member states.

This month, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said thousands in the country could die.

""We have chosen a strategy of trying to flatten the curve and not get too dramatic a process, because then the health care system probably will not cope,"" he told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. ""But it also means that we will have more seriously ill people who need intensive care — we will have significantly more deaths. We will count the dead in thousands.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/04/26/845211085/stockholm-expected-to-reach-herd-immunity-in-may-swedish-ambassador-says

Updated at on Friday at 1:30 p.m. ET

President Trump on Friday signed Congress' latest coronavirus economic relief package, which includes additional aid to small businesses and hospitals.

The measure passed overwhelmingly in the House on Thursday — 388-5, with one lawmaker voting present.

The five lawmakers who voted against the package included one Democrat — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — and four Republicans — Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jody Hice of Georgia, Ken Buck of Colorado and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

""We have our differences, but we are coming together on this particular bill, and I am proud of that,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who made the case for ongoing, robust federal intervention as the only way out of the crisis. Pelosi on Thursday wore a white scarf to cover her face, but lowered it to speak on the House floor.

""I think that we have to do whatever we can to recognize that public policy has a role here, that governance carries with it responsibilities and opportunity and results and progress for the American people,"" she said. ""And that science and governance are the answers to meeting the health care needs and meeting the needs of our economy as we go forward.""

The Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent on Tuesday.

The details

The $484 billion package includes an additional $321 billion for the newly created Paycheck Protection Program, a lending program designed to help small businesses stay afloat with forgivable loans during the crisis. PPP was popular and ran out of its initial influx of $350 billion in just two weeks. It is likely the program will need additional funding. Republicans have criticized Democrats for holding up the bill — initially a stand-alone $250 billion request to fund PPP.

In the end, Democrats secured an additional $60 billion carved out for smaller banks to assist businesses, many minority-owned, that have struggled to borrow from bigger lenders. It also includes $100 billion Democrats sought for hospitals and more testing.

They were unsuccessful, however, in their efforts to include additional resources for state and local governments — a fight they vowed to carry on to the next round of funding talks.

""There will not be another bill without state and local government"" resources in it,"" Pelosi said on Friday.

Social distancing during votes

The House debate on Thursday included stark images reflective of the time: House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow mask, as did most lawmakers and aides who appeared in the chamber. The visitors' galleries, normally open to the public, were closed.

It was the first roll call vote in the House since it approved a prior coronavirus relief bill on March 14. After that vote, two lawmakers fell ill and about a dozen others self-quarantined as a result. One of those quarantined members, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., later tested positive for COVID-19. House leaders installed more aggressive social distancing guidelines for today's votes.

""We should be mindful of the people surrounding us,"" said House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who is leading an ongoing effort to find ways to allow lawmakers to vote and hold hearings remotely.

Loading...

Members were directed to vote in smaller groups broken down by alphabetical order for each vote. Between floor speeches and votes, lawmakers were asked to stay in their offices. And members were asked to vote by machine and not a manual card that requires more contact. Short recesses were held between debates and votes to clean the chamber.

The pandemic also continues to affect lawmakers personally. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., announced on the House floor that her sister is hospitalized with COVID-19. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that her eldest brother died from the virus on Tuesday.

Next up

This is the fourth measure Congress has approved since March 1 to confront coronavirus and the economic fallout. While all four enjoyed fast, bipartisan support, there are signals that the parties are retreating to more familiar partisan lines for an anticipated fifth package.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he wants a ""pause"" before Congress considers additional legislation, and that it is unlikely additional measures will be able to pass the Senate by unanimous consent, which is generally reserved for noncontroversial bills. He has also indicated he will oppose any no-strings-attached funding for states and that he supports a new legal channel for states to declare bankruptcy to address their fiscal woes.

Among the measures Congress is expected to debate for inclusion in future legislation is funding for state and local governments to make up for budget shortfalls, additional cash payments to American workers and families, extended unemployment benefits, aid for the U.S. Postal Service and first responders, and new infrastructure spending.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/04/23/842706630/congress-passes-latest-economic-relief-package-to-confront-coronavirus
['Linda Holmes'],2020-04-19,Michael Jordan And The Chicago Bulls Play Some Good Basketball In 'The Last Dance',"Michael Jordan And The Chicago Bulls Play Some Good Basketball In 'The Last Dance'

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andy Hayt/NBAE/Getty Images Andy Hayt/NBAE/Getty Images

The documentary series The Last Dance, which begins Sunday night on ESPN, is about basketball.

Maybe that should be obvious, since it's the story of Michael Jordan and the dominant Chicago Bulls team that won six NBA championships in the 1990s. But understand: it's really about basketball. It's not O.J.: Made In America, which was primarily about race and policing and media. It's not like some of the documentaries in ESPN's 30 For 30 series — to which this feels like a spiritual cousin — that use sports as a way to talk about other things.

No, The Last Dance is really, deeply, intensely about NBA basketball. It's about why Michael Jordan was as dominant and feared as he was, and about how you build a team that can win that much. It's also about how even Jordan could not win championships by himself, and about how team dynamics were affected by such a towering figure. It's about the business of the NBA and the egos and whims of owners and general managers.

The structure of The Last Dance is a little complicated, in that it follows two timelines simultaneously, one gradually catching up to the other. The first is the entire period of the Bulls' ascendance and dominance, from the drafting of Jordan in 1984 through their six championship seasons: a three-peat in 1991, 1992 and 1993; another in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The second timeline is a much more deliberate examination of just that last winning season, the 1997-98 year in which, despite the five championships they'd already won together, the futures of Jordan, coach Phil Jackson, and underpaid second man Scottie Pippen were all uncertain. (The documentary explains early on that in 1997-98, the Bulls and Jordan allowed a film crew tremendous access, which is why there's abundant footage from that season.)

toggle caption Jason Hehier/ESPN

Director Jason Hehir makes wise use of visual cues and a sliding on-screen timeline to continually reorient you to where you are in the story. And it's effective to tell the story of that last season and slide back in time, over and over, to revisit the story up to that point. But I suspect there will be people who will find the back and forth frustrating, particularly if they're following it week by week rather than in a giant binge.

At the center of the documentary, at the center of the Bulls, and in some ways at the center of the world, especially circa 1993, is Michael Jordan. Jordan has always somehow been both ubiquitous and a little elusive. These are by far the most involved, seemingly candid interviews I've ever seen with him; he gave the filmmakers a lot of time to talk about everything from his tensions with Isiah Thomas to the death of his father.

Incidentally, the bad blood between the Bulls and the early '90s Detroit Pistons — Thomas especially — is one of the juiciest tales that arises from the first years of the Bulls' dominance. Some examinations of old sports rivalries show former athletes burying the hatchet or at least finding some humor in their pasts (as in the outstanding 30 For 30 entry Winning Time, about the Pacers and the Knicks). This is not that kind of documentary. Jordan doesn't seem to have lost an iota of his disdain when it comes to Thomas, and the filmmakers offer some artfully presented evidence that he's got good reason to remain frustrated.

The interview techniques here are very smart; I especially like the decision to sometimes let an interview subject see the footage of what someone else has already said. Sometimes you get a wry ""that's about right""; sometimes you get a laugh; sometimes you get Jordan roundly ridiculing another player's reminiscence of perhaps having gotten the better of Jordan once, just for a moment. He assures you that never happened. Never.

In fact, one of the most compelling threads in The Last Dance is the fine line between Jordan's unmatched competitive drive — to which everyone attributes much of his success — and his extreme sensitivity to slights. Even at the height of his powers, he cannot bear to have anyone even casually compared to him, in any way, lest his uniqueness be bruised. Over and over, he explains that his desire to win a particular game came from a need to retaliate following something inadequately reverent that was said about him or the Bulls. (This at a time when he was also exhausted by the demands of being as famous as he was.) He attributes one of his best performances to wanting to get back at someone who didn't greet him at a restaurant.

Did Michael Jordan, who could have crushed most of his enemies in multiple ways at any time, actually need to make things this personal in order to be motivated, as he seems to suggest? Or was he just an outstanding basketball player who also nursed decades of grudges because it's just how he is? Do you need resentments to be that good?

It feels important that The Last Dance doesn't seem built to change anyone's opinion of Jordan, for better or worse. It returns again and again to his extraordinary talent, his legendary work ethic (including during his stint in minor league baseball, which took place between the Bulls' two three-peats), his closeness with his family, and his version of leadership — which looks a lot like bullying, but which teammates who are interviewed generally insist was for the best.

But there's also a lot of time spent on the fact that no matter how good Jordan was, and no matter how much talent he had, he was never going to win six championships without the rest of his team. In that final season, when Pippen — who everyone then agrees is wildly underpaid because he got into an ill-advised seven-year contract — decides to have surgery on his foot at the beginning of the season rather than getting it over with in the off-season, in part because he feels stung by management's unwillingness to renegotiate, Jordan is irate. Pippen has left him out there to fend for himself, he complains. He has disappointed the team. Indeed, the season doesn't start off well at all.

And ... well, wasn't this Pippen's point? Wasn't he precisely trying to demonstrate that he was needed more than they were treating him like he was needed, even with the great Michael Jordan on board? And didn't he prove he was right? This, too: Couldn't Jordan have thrown his massive influence behind Pippen's request for a renegotiation as he had behind Phil Jackson, announcing he'd quit if the coach was replaced? It's not explicitly explored, but watching Jordan get so angry that someone else was also trying to have his value recognized is, at times, curious.

The biggest open question from The Last Dance is what it would take to put together a team this dominant over this period of time again. Could you possibly keep guys together long enough? If a Scottie Pippen doesn't get into a bad seven-year contract (a mistake you have to assume young players want to avoid) that lets the Bulls keep him cheaply, does Michael Jordan get the support he needs to be Michael Jordan in the first place? Put another way: No matter how good LeBron James is, it seems like he was probably never going to win six championships in eight years with the same team.

I think it will take at least a passing interest in the NBA, or in Jordan, to find this series fully satisfying. But for people who wonder whether we'll ever see sports dynasties again, there's a great deal here to enjoy. And if nothing else, you will certainly see some tremendous dunks.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/04/19/836882712/michael-jordan-and-the-chicago-bulls-play-some-good-basketball-in-the-last-dance

Pan-fried buns with beef filling, shrimp stir-fried with seasonal bamboo shoots, roasted chicken and seared scallops — such dishes are on the menu for the Shanghai medical staff who recently returned from Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicenter of China's COVID-19 outbreak. To show its gratitude for the 1,649 now-quarantined workers, the city has cooked up a free 14-day meal plan for them.

In Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province, the city's Federation of Trade Unions is saying ""thank you"" by handing out 2,000 yuan ($280) cash to the families of 122 medics, who will also get paid leave to recuperate after ""winning the battle of epidemic prevention and control.""

Meanwhile, in Guizhou province, residents are wondering: Is a reward still a reward if the heroes have to pay for it?

In the poverty-stricken province, Guizhou Liquor Exchange, a trading platform that promotes liquor trading, investment and storage, took the appreciation game in a questionable direction. It recently offered each of the 1,443 front-line medical workers back from Hubei the opportunity to buy up to six bottles of the nation's most sought-after liquor — a locally produced, 106 proof Maotai liquor called Feitian — at 1,499 yuan ($210) per bottle.

A bottle of Feitian could fetch from 2,000 yuan ($280) to 300,000 yuan ($42,200), depending on the year it was made and market demand.

Produced by the state-owned Kweichow Moutai Group in Guizhou, Maotai liquor is the Chinese answer to premium scotch. Known as China's national liquor, it's often served on official occasions and holiday dinner tables. In 1972, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai made a Maotai toast to then-President Richard Nixon, who was warned prior to the banquet not to drink it. (He did anyway.)

Although the Group sold 142,000 tons of liquor worth more than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) in 2019, it's not enough for those thirsty for Maotai. Fake Maotai liquors are all over the market, retailing at similar price points. Some fans make pilgrimages to Maotai town, where each visitor is allowed to buy two bottles. On the Chinese e-commerce site Tmall, Feitian liquor is available each day, with a limit of two bottles per 180 days. It's snapped up in seconds.

While $2,106 for six might be a steal, consider the per capita disposable income of an urban resident in Guizhou: 20,397 yuan ($2,870) in 2019. That's one reason the offer has been derided as a crass publicity stunt.

""They [Guizhou Liquor Exchange] are shameless,"" said a commenter on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. ""It's just a couple bottles of liquor. Can't they just give for free?""

""This is how you treat our heroes?"" another opined.

""Do you think regular medical workers can afford it?"" one asked.

Others think it's a good deal, especially given the resale market.

""Do you not know how expensive Maotai liquor is? Isn't this a reward?"" one netizen asked.

""I think it's pretty good,"" another said. ""They can make money by reselling these liquors.""

As criticism became increasingly heated, the Guizhou government stepped in, asking Guizhou Liquor Exchange to immediately stop using the pandemic for marketing purposes.

The $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package marks the largest rescue package in American history. President Trump announced Wednesday that it includes $300 billion in direct payments to individuals to alleviate at least a little of the financial pain caused by the deliberate near-standstill of the U.S. economy.

But despite promises that the one-time funds will be distributed ""within the next three weeks,"" it will likely be months before the stimulus checks hit bank accounts according to experts.

Under the plan, single people earning incomes below $75,000 will receive as much as $1,200 as ""direct payments into most people's deposit accounts,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a news briefing on Wednesday.

Married couples would get $2,400, and parents would receive $500 for each child under age 17. About 90% of households — approximately 165 million — would benefit from the checks, according to the Tax Policy Center.

Payments would be phased out beyond those income limits, and people making more than $99,000 will not be eligible at all.

How soon can I expect my check?

""It really depends on what information the IRS has on you,"" Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told NPR.

That's because the infusion of cash will be distributed by the IRS, so those who have previously received tax refunds via direct deposit will be first in line for the rebate checks. Pomerleau, estimates the earliest those payments will go out is three to four weeks after the package is approved.

Alternatively, people who receive tax refunds through the mail will have to hold out much longer.

""I don't think physical checks will be in the mail for another three to four months,"" Pomerleau said, citing delays in the system in 2008 when the government last issued national stimulus payments under the George W. Bush administration.

Back then the financial relief package was signed into law in February but the delivery date for people whose checks were sent through the mail was somewhere between May and July.

There's another group who may have an even longer wait: Those who receive tax refunds in the mail and have moved since filing 2018 taxes.

""So far there's no information on how [the IRS is] going to handle that,"" he said.

What if I didn't file 2018 taxes?

Pomerleau says nonfilers, including recent college graduates, and those who didn't file 2018 taxes because they had no obligation, ""would be left out unless they hurry up and file a return for 2019.""

Americans receiving Social Security benefits are also on file with the government and their payments will be based on those records, he added.

What if I made more than $99,000 in 2018 or 2019?

Those who earned more than $99,000 are not totally shut out from the massive relief package if they expect to make less than that sum in the coming year.

The IRS will allow tax filers to qualify for the relief aid next year, when filing 2020 taxes.

""That of course is no good for someone who needs to pay their bills today,"" Pomerleau said, ""but all is not lost.""

Other holdups

Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, suspects the IRS's infrastructure, or lack thereof, will create even more delays for desperate people.

In the past it has taken several months for the government to develop, test and install the kind of software necessary to launch a rebate program. But it is unclear, what if anything, the administration has done behind the scenes so far.

""It takes several months to get a program like this up and moving,"" Holtzblatt told NPR.

""I hope that they've been building their infrastructure in the days between when they first announced they were going to do this and the day of enactment,"" she said, adding that in 2008, the process took at least three months.

Impact of COVID-19 on the IRS

Another unknown factor, that Holtzblatt says needs to be considered is how the COVID-19 disease is going to affect the capacity of the IRS staff to ensure the timely delivery of the payments.

As she noted in a recent blog post:

All of that may slow distribution of the payments, Holtzblatt said.

She cautioned the public to be patient: ""The IRS will be overburdened and there will be lots of taxpayer confusion ... and all this will collide with the processing of 2019 returns. There will be snafus.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/822224393/show-me-the-relief-money-no-promises-on-when-coronavirus-checks-are-coming

Toilet tissue isn't the only paper product that Americans are hoarding these days. Paper money is also in high demand.

Banks are seeing more cash withdrawals as nervous customers try to protect themselves from the uncertainty of the coronavirus clampdown.

There are reports — especially from wealthy neighborhoods — of people pulling tens of thousands of dollars out of their bank accounts. Demand was so high that one bank branch in Midtown Manhattan temporarily ran out of $100 bills, The New York Times reported. The bank was quickly resupplied the following day.

While stocking your pantry with pasta and canned goods may provide some measure of security, officials say there are risks to keeping too much cash on hand.

""Forget the mattress. Forget hoarding cash. Your money is the safest at the bank,"" said Jelena McWilliams, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which safeguards bank accounts.

McWilliams understands the anxiety that the coronavirus provokes. She'll confess to making her own panicked grocery run to Costco. But the federal bank regulator says there's no need for customers to empty the ATM.

""Just as it is not necessarily rational to hoard toilet paper, it is also not rational to hoard cash,"" McWilliams said.

Some banks have limited hours or even closed branches out of concern for their workers' health. But ATMs are still operating and getting frequent cash deliveries from armored trucks. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin noted this week that armored truck drivers and others who work in financial services are considered essential parts of the nation's critical infrastructure.

Because that infrastructure is still functioning, financial advisers say the race to grab cash is misguided.

""This is not a natural disaster like a hurricane or an earthquake where the electricity is out,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. ""This is the opposite in many ways, in that, if you're holed up at home, having a pile of cash isn't going to do you a whole lot of good.""

McBride said homebound customers are better off leaving their money in the bank so they can pay their mortgage and credit card bills online. It also relieves any worry about loss or theft.

Before the coronavirus hit, Americans were steadily moving away from cash and increasingly relying on credit cards, debit cards and new forms of digital payment.

""Even person-to-person payments, that's increasingly done through apps like Venmo or Zelle and not by reaching into your pocketbook, pulling out some green stuff and handing it to your colleague,"" McBride said.

Of course, millions of Americans don't have bank accounts and may have to rely on cash. Some have suggested that handling paper money may increase your chances of getting or passing on the coronavirus, although there's little scientific consensus on that.

In some cases, people's rush to pull money out of the bank has been stoked by scam artists. The FDIC warned a California gold dealer last week to stop advertising its products with the false claim that consumer bank accounts could be seized in a time of crisis.

""That is absolutely false,"" McWilliams said. ""It's patently false. And frankly it's criminal in my opinion.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic intensifies, some communities will be better equipped to treat the sickest patients — specifically those requiring admission to intensive care units — than others. Not only do ICU capabilities vary from hospital to hospital, but also some parts of the country have far more critical care beds by population than others.

An NPR analysis of data from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice looked at how the nation's 100,000 ICU beds are distributed across the more than 300 markets that make up the country's hospital system.

NPR found that ICU bed capacity varies widely across the United States. ICU beds are especially important now because they are the hospital units typically equipped to treat patients with respiratory problems that require ventilators.

""The implications from this data is that the pandemic will look quite different in different places,"" says Eric Toner, a physician and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

""Some places will maybe be able to get by without having to ration critical care. Other places definitely will not be able to,"" he says. ""The worst-case scenario would be catastrophic failure of health care in that facility.""

A report from the Society of Critical Care Medicine found that more than nine out of 10 intensive care beds nationally are in metropolitan areas with a population of more than 50,000. Only 1 percent of America's ICU beds are in rural areas.

David Wallace, a researcher and critical care doctor at the University of Pittsburgh, found that larger hospitals, teaching hospitals and those whose ICUs were at high occupancy were more likely to have added ICU beds from 1997 to 2011.

Toner says those disparities will expose regional differences in access to critical health care in a pandemic.

""We are seeing the fruits of trying to have a market solution to a national strategic issue,"" he says. ""We have the number of beds we do because that's what the market is or demands where.""

Craig Coopersmith, who leads the Emory Critical Care Center in Atlanta, calls the pandemic a ""once-in-a-lifetime event.""

""One can't develop a health care system solely for times of pandemic,"" he says. ""If they did, the vast majority of times ICU beds would be empty.""

And, he says, there is ""absolutely no standard,"" for critical care beds nationally.

Still, whether it's better to be a COVID-19 patient in a big city or a smaller one will depend on how many people are infected in those areas and on the local hospital's capabilities.

Wallace says even his own research into counting ICU beds is an oversimplification because intensive care units themselves vary so widely.

""While I may be able to count the number of beds in Region A and Region B and the underlying populations in those two areas,"" he says, ""what those beds and ICUs are actually able to provide is an entirely different question.""

Both Wallace and Toner tell NPR that hospitals will try to manage high demand for critical care beds by repurposing some of their facilities, shifting staff and moving patients between hospitals. Toner argues the country should collectively share that cost.

""It's in the national interest to have hospitals and intensive care capacity in places that are not profitable,"" he says.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/25/819940409/icu-bed-capacity-varies-widely-nationwide-see-how-your-area-stacks-up

One of the pioneers of Afro-funk music, the saxophonist Manu Dibango, has died of COVID-19. He was 86 years old, and died in Paris. Internationally, he was best known for his 1972 song ""Soul Makossa,"" though his entire oeuvre could have been the soundtrack to a cooler 1970s than most people lived. But that one, funk-drenched hit, lit by Dibango's burning saxophone, went on to influence the sound of American disco — and its hooky spoken intro helped power songs by Michael Jackson and Rihanna.

Dibango's death was announced on social media by his representatives, who said that he died Tuesday at age 86 due to the coronavirus; they had also announced last Wednesday that he had been hospitalized due to the pandemic. A public memorial will be ""organized when possible,"" the announcement said.

YouTube

""Soul Makossa"" became a hit in New York after DJ David Mancuso started playing the track at his Loft parties.

Dibango was born December 12, 1933, in the port city of Douala, Cameroon; his father was a civil servant. His parents' marriage was unusual for the time: His mother came from the Douala ethnic group, and his father from the Yabassi, and he later said that he never felt quite at home identifying with either.

When he was 15 years old, his parents sent him to study in France, so that he could return as an administrator, like his father. He paid for his initial rent in Europe with three kilograms of coffee from home — a fact that provided the title for his autobiography. He had been sent abroad to study philosophy, but instead fell in love with American jazz. As he told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1990, his parents were extremely upset by his decision to pursue music professionally, and cut him off.

While still in France, he began playing in bands — piano, mandolin, vibraphone and, soon enough, saxophone. Dibango made his way to Brussels, where he met one of Africa's greatest bandleaders, Joseph ""Grand Kallé"" Kabasele, a master of Congolese rumba. This was a time of exciting, super-danceable musical experimentation -- Congolese rumba was a blend of American jazz, Cuban rhythms and buoyant African sounds. The genre-bending, free-wheeling music became part of the roots of Dibango's own creativity as a bandleader.

Kabasele hired Dibango to play saxophone in his group, African Jazz. As part of that group, Dibango traveled to what was then Congo, now Zaire, to spend a month with the band. Instead, he stayed two years and opened his own club, Tam-Tam, in what was then the city of Léopoldville, now Kinshasa.

Dibango then moved to France where, in the late 1960s and early '70s, he began to forge a career as a significant solo artist. But ""Soul Makossa"" skyrocketed him to international fame.

In the years after the success of ""Soul Makossa,"" he collaborated with many famed international artists, including Art Blakey, Herbie Hancock, Don Cherry, Sly and Robbie, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, King Sunny Adé, Youssou N'Dour, Hugh Masekela and Fela Kuti.

""Soul Makossa"" was originally the B-side for a Dibango 45 RPM single; its refrain was something of a branding exercise for ""makossa,"" the funky, jazz-tinged dance genre that Dibango pioneered. (Kossa means ""dance"" in Douala, his mother's native language.)

In 1982, Michael Jackson picked up a version of a line that Dibango declaimed on ""Soul Makossa"" — which Jackson sang as ""mama-se, mama-sa, ma-makossa"" — on his song ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' "" from the album Thriller.

The Cameroonian musician sued the American megastar; Jackson settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. In 2007, Rihanna sampled Jackson's version of the ""Soul Makossa"" line on her song ""Don't Stop the Music."" (Jackson had given her permission, but not Dibango.) Two years later, Dibango sued Jackson again, as well as Rihanna in France; that time, his case failed, due to the earlier settlement.

Publicly, Dibango did not dwell on his wranglings with Jackson; as he wryly told Fresh Air in 1990, ""I think he wanted to say hello to Africa somewhere.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/24/820598340/afro-funk-saxophonist-manu-dibango-dies-of-covid-19

President Trump has drawn repeated comparisons between the novel coronavirus outbreak and the flu season.

""We have a lot of people dying from the flu on top of everything else,"" he said Monday. ""It's very bad. It looks like it could be over 50,000.""

The reality so far for the current flu season is still emerging. There have been at least 23,000 deaths from flu during the 2019-2020 season, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The upper range of the estimate for deaths is 59,000.

The CDC estimates there have been at least 38 million flu illnesses and 390,000 hospitalizations.

The CDC estimates are based on weekly surveillance data and are preliminary.

The rates of hospitalization for flu ""remain moderate"" overall, according to the CDC. But some age groups have experienced higher hospitalization rates than usual. Flu hospitalizations are ""the highest CDC has on record"" for young children, up to age 4, and adults ages, 18-49.

While the flu can send hundreds of thousands of people to the hospital each year, the seasonal effect is reasonably well understood and planned for. The comparison between flu and COVID-19 doesn't capture the strain that the new coronavirus is putting on hospitals.

The Tony Award-winning American playwright Terrence McNally has died of complications related to COVID-19. He died Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. at age 81. McNally was a lung cancer survivor who lived with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

His work on Kiss of the Spider Woman, Love! Valor! Compassion!, Master Class and Ragtime won him a string of Tonys in the 1990s. He also won a lifetime achievement Tony last year. In all, McNally's body of work encompassed some four dozen plays and musicals, many of which went to Broadway.

McNally was born Nov. 3, 1938 in St. Petersburg, Fla., and grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, before attending Columbia University in New York. (In a 2002 interview with the school, he professed not to know how he had graduated, saying: ""I went to the theater so much."")

McNally was a crucial voice in illuminating the lives of LGBT people in the United States; in 1995, the New York Times marveled that his ""proudly gay play"" Love! Valor! Compassion! became a mainstream Broadway hit.

In a 2019 interview, he told Playbill he was ""tone-deaf,"" but that he also considered himself to be a musical person. Certainly, much of his stage work — whether writing books for musicals or, in the case of Master Class, creating a theatrical portrait of opera legend Maria Callas — was an expression of his deep love of music. He also wrote the librettos for two operas by composer Jake Heggie: Great Scott and Dead Man Walking.

In a 2003 interview with WHYY's Fresh Air, composer John Kander — who, alongside lyricist Fred Ebb, collaborated with McNally on several shows, including Kiss of the Spider Woman — called him a gracious co-creator. ""[McNally] is very good at writing a scene that has five pages in it that he knows perfectly well we're going to steal and musicalize,"" Kander said, ""but where he will let a character go on in dialogue in a way which is probably unnatural for him emotionally to do. And he does that in order to turn Fred and me on to musicalizing it.""

Among his other awards were an Emmy, two Guggenheim Fellowships, four Drama Desk Awards, two Obies and an induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/821114834/terrence-mcnally-honored-american-playwright-has-died-of-coronavirus

That's after Kentucky's Sen. Paul, 57, revealed on Sunday that he had tested positive for the virus and Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, both of Utah, said they had recent contact with Paul, but showed no symptoms. All three are now in self-quarantine.

A statement from Romney's office said: ""He has no symptoms but will be tested.""

Senator Romney’s office issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/tBSx03ZlTr — Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) March 22, 2020

In a separate statement, Lee said he also showed no symptoms or other risk factors and that he had been advised that a test for the virus ""was not warranted.""

Lee, 48 and Romney, 73, are both expected to self-quarantine for 14 days.

Other senators, including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., have previously self-quarantined as a precautionary measure.

Because the Senate has no provision for remote voting, the absence of the three puts additional strain on Senate Republicans to garner the votes necessary to pass the relief bill — legislation aimed at an injection of cash into the economy — including direct payments of $1,200 to most Americans and $350 billion in loans to small businesses in an effort to save jobs. Even so, Rand and Lee were among eight Republicans who voted against the package in an earlier vote.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blocked a vote on the stimulus bill late Thursday, saying it did not go far enough.

Last week, The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Paul was present at an event on March 7 where two individuals who attended later tested positive for the coronavirus. The newspaper said several of the attendees had subsequently self-quarantined.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Stringer/Getty Images Stringer/Getty Images

Pregnancy can sometimes be an uncertain and stressful period in the best of circumstances. But during a pandemic, that anxiety can quickly multiply. Researchers are working quickly to learn more about what the new coronavirus — as well as its impact on our daily lives — means right now for people who are pregnant. And health care providers are game-planning with mothers about how to best manage care in light of growing limits on public contact.

Here's what we know so far.

Am I more at risk if I'm pregnant??

""The good news is that thus far there hasn't been any indication that pregnant women are more severely affected"" by the novel virus, says Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory Healthcare and a senior author of a prepress review paper slated to publish in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

This comes as a welcome surprise, as the similar coronavirus that caused SARS had a much higher fatality rate for pregnant people (about 25%, according to the limited data available from the 2003 outbreak) than for the general population (about 10%).

The current, hopeful assessments of the new coronavirus are based in large part on a study published online last month in The Lancet of nine pregnant women in their third trimester in Wuhan, China, who had pneumonia caused by COVID-19. None of the women developed severe illness, and all of their babies were born healthy.

""According to the current evidence in China, the clinical performance of pregnant women with COVID-19 is consistent with that of ordinary adults,"" says Jie Qiao, director of the National Clinical Research Center of Obstetrics and Gynecology Disease in China, who was not involved in that study but authored a commentary about it in the same issue of The Lancet.

Jamieson notes, however, that ""we don't have very much evidence from this coronavirus."" And although the data from third-trimester pregnancies appeared reassuring, we don't yet know much about the first or second trimester during a COVID-19 illness. So Jamieson, Qiao and other experts are closely following the evolving data.

What extra precautions should I take while pregnant?

The immune system's efficacy dips during pregnancy, which places pregnant people at a higher risk for contracting many transmissible illnesses — whether foodborne or respiratory. ""They should be considered an at-risk group,"" Jamieson says.

Official recommendations during pregnancy are currently about the same as for the general population, including avoiding crowds, staying away from sick people, washing hands frequently and not touching the face.

Qiao takes these suggestions a step further, adding that she recommends avoiding public areas if possible — and wearing a face mask when out. And talk to your doctor about telemedicine, to avoid unnecessary visits to the office. ""Except important pregnancy checkups,"" she says, ""consulting [your] doctors online is recommended."" Many offices are already working to consolidate in-person appointments (for example, if someone is coming in for an ultrasound, a routine prenatal check might be added to the same visit).

In addition to personal steps, Jamieson notes that it is important to consider how such a widespread outbreak could strain the health system, leading to disruptions in normal care. To prepare for that, she says, she advises that pregnant people have their medical records on hand.

Neil Silverman, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, adds that hospitals are already ramping up to increase the capacity to care for pregnant women.

What kind of contingency planning should I do for delivery?

One big change that is already occurring in many labor and delivery wards is that they are limiting the number of visitors who can accompany anyone admitted for delivery — including through the postpartum stay. ""This has been, reasonably, upsetting,"" says Rachel Pilliod, an OB-GYN who teaches obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University. ""We understand that giving birth is more than a physiological process,"" she says, and many families have expectations about sharing the occasion in person.

She advises women who might deliver during the pandemic to ask their provider and the place where they intend to deliver about current rules on visitors. Typically the limit has been to one other healthy adult for the duration of the hospital stay.

Ahead of delivery, Jamieson advocates that ""every pregnant woman and her family should have a plan, which should include what would happen if she or an additional caregiver gets sick."" For example, if a partner becomes ill with COVID-19 and is trying to self-isolate, is there another caregiver who can step in to help care for a newborn and mother? And because the illness is riskier for older adults, if the other caregiver might have once meant a new grandparent, a younger adult might be a better backup if possible.

If I do get sick, how do I protect my newborn?

If you do get sick near your delivery date with confirmed or even suspected COVID-19, there are special precautions to be aware of. Though new mothers might not be at higher risk themselves, it is important to avoid passing the virus to a newborn.

Early research has not shown any evidence that the virus can be transmitted in utero, during delivery or through breast milk. But transmission can occur after birth when infants are in close contact with someone who has the illness.

This issue raises challenging decisions for families and health care providers. The practice of keeping a newborn in the same hospital room as the mother after birth (known as ""rooming-in"") has become popular in many U.S. hospitals. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends avoiding rooming-in for new mothers with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infections. The guidelines (as of publication) say these infants should be placed in isolation and themselves be treated as presumed coronavirus cases, being cared for by healthy caregivers and medical staff in protective garb. ""The main purpose is to avoid close contact with mothers, isolating respiratory tract transmission and possible infection,"" Qiao says.

Pilliod notes that in her practice, the CDC guidelines will be discussed with families so that they understand the risks and trade-offs of their care decisions. Healthy family members may have the choice to spend time with the newborns in isolation.

If an infant is taken to isolation directly after birth, the CDC recommends that ill women who would like to provide breast milk for their infant use a breast pump, being sure to practice good pumping hygiene. Direct breastfeeding could also be possible if the infected mother wears a mask, but it is not currently the CDC's first choice. ""It's a difficult decision, and I think the mother needs to be involved in the conversation about the risks,"" Jamieson says.

What else do I need to know if I get sick during pregnancy?

Research is underway, but there is not currently a definitive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. Once these do emerge, it's a distinct possibility that they won't initially be approved for use during pregnancy and lactation. ""This is one of the big concerns,"" Jamieson says.

For now, says Silverman, it is important to ""be aware of the potential symptoms so [pregnant women] can call their health provider if they have any,"" which include fever, respiratory symptoms or possibly even diarrhea. Additionally, he notes, if they learn they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, they should monitor their own temperature and be especially aware of any respiratory symptoms. Their health care provider can advise best steps for care and testing.

Qiao notes that individuals should also be careful when selecting over-the-counter medications for treating symptoms, as many standard remedies should be avoided during pregnancy (including many cough and cold — as well as pain and fever — medicines).

With the large uptick in the number of cases of the novel virus, researchers are gathering more data about the disease's impact on pregnant people, fetuses and newborns. Synthesizing all of that information will likely take additional time, but it will eventually help better guide public health and health care recommendations.

In the meantime, the best offense remains a good defense. And that means pregnant people — and those around them — should follow the best current personal and social hygiene recommendations. ""We keep pregnant women and their newborns safer by keeping everyone around them healthy as well,"" Pilliod says. ""It takes a village to keep us all safe.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/22/817801475/pregnant-and-worried-about-coronavirus-how-to-stay-safe-and-make-a-game-plan

Twila Boyd, a pharmacist in South Charleston, Ohio, explains what it's like to treat patients in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

We've been hearing from health care workers of all kinds as they battle the coronavirus outbreak. Now a pharmacist, Twila Boyd - she owns the Charleston Pharmacy in South Charleston, Ohio, a town of about a thousand people. She joins us from her home now. Thanks very much for being with us.

TWILA BOYD: Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

SIMON: How have your days changed? - a whole lot busier?

BOYD: (Laughter) On Monday, we saw a 50% spike in our pharmacy volume. And it's continued the rest of this week - people trying to get their medications early or trying to get multiple months filled of their medications. So yes, it's been very interesting.

SIMON: Can you help them?

BOYD: Yes, we can. What we're trying to tell people - that if they just normally get a 30-day supply of their medication, it's best if they continue with that pattern. If you have people stockpiling, then that doesn't leave as much or anything left for the other ones later on. So it's like the grocery stores. But right now, we have medications. And we're doing fine. We're able to get things in. It may take us a couple of days to get something that we need. But we are able to get it in.

SIMON: People working for you - overextended, extra hours, extra stress?

BOYD: I think this is a very stressful time because a lot of their friends maybe are working from home, and they're feeling the stress of dealing with the population where somebody might be a carrier that doesn't have any symptoms. But right now, they're doing very well. There's a lot of cookies and cupcakes that are being brought in. And the people that come in are bringing - some of them will bring health cleaning supplies. So that's nice.

SIMON: Do you have any masks?

BOYD: No, we do not have any masks. We do have gloves. I do have a delivery driver that goes out every day Monday through Friday. And he does wear gloves. And he has a mask. So he can wear those no problem because he is dealing with the elderly. He's dealing with children or, you know, families. So he is trying to have minimal contact with them.

SIMON: Do you get new protocols all the time?

BOYD: Every day - yes, we do. The one that is really good is that we do not have to have everybody sign with either the pen pad with the pen or their finger. So we don't have people touching the machine constantly or one right after the other. Then other things - it's telling us that if you have the elderly, pregnant or somebody that is sick, if they come into the pharmacy, they would be waited on immediately. And then they would be ushered out of the pharmacy once they get their medication. So we don't really have anybody that sits in the pharmacy and waits for their medication. Most of the people just drop their prescriptions off and are leaving the pharmacy. So that is also good.

SIMON: Well, I guess we should note that Charleston Pharmacy - South Charleston, Ohio - is open for business.

BOYD: Yes, it is (laughter). Yes, it is. We are open. And it's always nice that - if you have a pharmacy - that you are familiar with the pharmacist, that if you have questions, you can call them, or you can talk to them. At this point, they're really very busy. And most of them are understaffed.

SIMON: Yeah.

BOYD: But during regular periods of time, if you have questions, you could always talk to the pharmacist because we are a wealth of knowledge. And we can certainly help you. Since we're usually the first ones - if someone is feeling sick...

SIMON: Yeah.

BOYD: ...They usually go to the pharmacy first. So if you think you might have it, we could help you with deciding whether you do have either the COVID-19, the flu or they just have a cold or if it's just allergy season. So we do see a lot of people coming in with runny noses right now.

SIMON: Twila Boyd owns and operates the Charleston Pharmacy - South Charleston, Ohio. Thanks very much. Good luck to you.

BOYD: Thank you very much.

Updated 6:14 p.m. ET

The Trump administration announced it will crack down on certain vaping products containing fruit, mint and other e-cigarette flavors to keep them away from kids. Manufacturers will have 30 days to take these products off the market before the Food and Drug Administration can take enforcement action.

The enforcement applies to many flavors of cartridge-based e-cigarettes. Menthol- and tobacco-flavored cartridges are exempt from the restriction, as are tank-based systems sold in vape shops, because data show these aren't popular among kids and teens.

""We're striking a balance,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during a news conference, explaining that e-cigarettes need to remain an ""off-ramp"" for adults to transition away from combustible cigarettes, but they can't become an ""on-ramp"" for children to become addicted to nicotine.

Azar stressed that all vape products are currently ""illegal"" because they are on the market despite not being cleared by the FDA. They are only allowed to be sold because the FDA is using its enforcement discretion. A judge ruled last summer that e-cigarette manufacturers would need to submit premarketing applications to the agency by May 12. They will then be allowed to remain on the market for one year while under FDA review.

The administration stressed this is not a ban.

""We are temporarily taking certain illegal products off the market if they are the types of products and flavors most widely used by kids,"" Azar said. Manufacturers can seek approval from the FDA to market even flavored products, as long as they're in compliance with the Tobacco Control Act.

More than 5 million kids and teens used e-cigarettes in 2019, up from 3.6 million the year before, according to the latest National Youth Tobacco Survey. Nearly 60% of respondents said their go-to e-cigarette brand was Juul. Nearly 1 million said they used an e-cigarette daily.

Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., said in a statement that the move ""falls far short"" of what the Trump administration promised last year. In September, Trump endorsed an FDA plan to remove all flavors ""including mint and menthol"" from e-cigarette products — not just cartridges like Juul. The plan stalled in November, reportedly because of industry pushback and other politics.

""A so-called flavor ban that exempts menthol and vape shops is no ban at all,"" Pallone said. ""Unfortunately, the Trump administration caved to industry lobbying pressure and decided to prioritize politics over people's health.""

Public health organizations, including the American Cancer Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics, also expressed ""outrage,"" especially with menthol's exclusion from enforcement.

""Big Tobacco's shameful record includes targeting youth and adults in minority and underserved populations with menthol products,"" Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said in a statement. ""Keeping menthol e-cigarettes on the market would enable the tobacco industry to extend a dangerous legacy that began with menthol cigarettes.""

Matthew Myers, president of Tobacco-Free Kids, said he and several public health leaders met with the president in November to discuss the e-cigarette crisis. The public health advocates were united in their views:

""We face a true public health crisis,"" he said. ""This is a totally preventable crisis because we have solutions and first and foremost the solution is to sweep the market entirely of all flavored e-cigarettes.""

Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said doctors flavor prescription drugs like amoxicillin because kids will take medicine that taste better. To her, ""leaving any [e-cigarette] flavor on the market is dangerous for children's health.""

For Gary LeRoy, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, what's happening with e-cigarettes feels like déjà vu.

""We've been here as a society,"" he said. ""When the tobacco industry introduced us to tobacco products, it promised that they were safe, that they were of no harm. We know what fell out of those promises.""

As the decade changes and we consider the state of women's health in America, who better to turn to than the authors of five taboo-busting books from 2019 that took on issues that generations of women haven't been talking about, but need to. We asked these outspoken doctors and health advocates to give us their Top 7 messages to women for 2020. Here's what they said.

1. Better birth control is possible — and necessary

""Because birth control has been an incredible force in the lives of women — allowing them to achieve (and even set) long-term educational goals and career goals, and achieve gains toward economic parity with men — there's a taboo around talking about it critically, for fear that it will be taken away, and our gains with it,"" says Sarah Hill, author of This Is Your Brain On Birth Control: The Surprising Science of Women, Hormones, and the Law of Unintended Consequences.

Hill wants to see more investment into research and development of better birth control. Hormonal birth control influences the brain in ways that make people uncomfortable to acknowledge, she says, including whom a woman finds attractive as a mate and, to some degree, how she responds to stress.

It used to seem like the best defense against sexist rhetoric was to pretend as if these effects didn't exist at all, Hill says. ""But sticking your head in the sand is no way to advocate for a better future for women.""

It can be uncomfortable acknowledging the flaws of hormonal contraception while simultaneously fighting to make it accessible, Hill says, but adds, ""it's a trade-off. We have to find a way to live in this discomfort while we push for improvements. Women deserve better.""

2. Most ""vaginal health"" products are bogus

One of the most pernicious myths is that vaginas are in a constant state of near-catastrophe and need cleaning and repair, says Dr. Jen Gunter, New York Times columnist and author of The Vagina Bible: The Vulva And The Vagina — Separating The Myth From The Medicine. Forget all those myths, she says.""Your vagina has got things covered.""

The messaging that a woman's genitalia needs constant upkeep — with things like special ""feminine"" washes, douches, hair removers, wipes and tighteners — is mostly promoted by companies that want to make women feel insecure so they'll buy something, she explains. ""If our genitalia required special care, we never would have evolved this way."" In general, Gunter says, it's a bad idea to rely on information from a source that's also trying to sell you something.

3. Transgender women are women

Gunter writes about gender transition and what she has heard from parents of trans kids is that it provided them with medical information that they weren't getting anywhere else — even from their primary health care provider.

What it comes down to is simple: ""Having a vagina isn't what makes you a woman. It's how you feel inside,"" says Gunter. ""We shouldn't reduce anyone to their body parts, but it happens more with women, and especially with trans women.""

Ultimately, she says, ""parts are parts, and people are people.""

4. Women's pain is real

For years, Abby Norman experienced extreme menstrual symptoms and extraordinary abdominal pain during sex. But doctors wrote her off. ""They implied they thought my pain was psychological,"" she says.

It was only when she started to bring her boyfriend with her to appointments that she felt taken seriously. ""All of a sudden, things changed. All I could think was, 'Why wasn't it enough when I was saying it?' Why is it that being a disappointment to the man in your life is the sign that things needed to change?""

Norman wrote about her experience — which culminated in a diagnosis of endometriosis — in her memoir Ask Me About My Uterus: A Quest to Make Doctors Believe in Women's Pain. She says the big takeaway (besides the need for more awareness and understanding of endometriosis) is that ""doctors need to acknowledge that women are capable of knowing themselves."" This phenomenon can be compounded when the patients are women of color.

5. It's time to rethink menopause

According to historian Susan Mattern, when women in premodern, agrarian societies would exit their reproductive age, ""it was viewed as an upgrade — an entrance into a really important life phase."" Mattern is the author of The Slow Moon Climbs: The Science, History, and Meaning of Menopause.

Too much emphasis in mass market books about menopause, she says, is placed on menopause ""treatments"" (or lack thereof).

""The modern way of thinking about menopause isn't the only way,"" she says. ""And other ways might serve us better.""

Mattern says humans have been a long-lived species for quite some time, and were ""engineered"" by evolution to live into our 70s — and thrive in our post-reproductive years. She says that what's new is the stigma attached to old age. ""We tend to think that aging is bad, and that only young people are useful. But if we're not appreciating what's going on during the rest of our lifespan, we're not understanding who we are.""

6. Vagina. Labia. Clitoris. It's OK to talk about them

These clinical terms are still often treated like dirty words, and that's a problem, Gunter says. ""When you can't say a word, the implication is that it's shameful and that it shouldn't be talked about. And that stifles your ability to find out what's typical, versus what might be a medical condition.""

Regularly, she says, women come to her office, ""and even behind closed doors, they can hardly say the words to describe what's wrong with their reproductive tract. They'll even say to me, 'I don't know why I'm having trouble saying this.' And that's not to disparage the women — that's just how effective the culture of shame is, even today.""

The danger of being unable to speak freely about bodies, Gunter says, is twofold. If women can't discuss health concerns with their doctor, not only will they miss out on treatment, but they also may get bad advice from less reputable, clandestine sources.

7. Women's rights are human rights

Jennifer Weiss-Wolf is fighting to end what she calls the ""tampon tax,"" which still exists in 32 states. She outlines the case against the taxation of menstrual products in her book Periods Gone Public: Taking A Stand For Menstrual Equity.

It's time to connect those issues to the ways society marginalizes certain other groups, she says, and push for greater dignity and justice for people experiencing homelessness or incarceration, too.

David Stern, a basketball Hall of Famer and former commissioner of the NBA, died on Wednesday at age 77. The NBA issued a statement saying that his death was the result of a brain hemorrhage that he suffered in mid-December.

Stern spent 30 years as commissioner of the NBA, beginning in 1984. He took over the league during a time of some uncertainty; the NBA's image had been battered by reports of widespread drug use among players. But that same year, Michael Jordan entered the league along with other soon-to-be superstars such as Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Under Stern's leadership, the league began to soar. It added seven teams, spread its brand globally and saw revenue and player salaries skyrocket.

Stern was also a driving force behind the creation of the WNBA in 1996. The commissioner of the WNBA, Cathy Engelbert, described Stern's commitment to women's sports as ""ahead of its time"" and said it had ""provided countless opportunities for women and young girls who aspire to play basketball.""

During Stern's time as commissioner, the NBA did see some problems, including tense labor battles that led to shortened seasons and four lockouts. Even so, Stern has been described as one of the most influential commissioners in NBA history. When he stepped down as commissioner in 2014, Stern was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.

Stern is survived by his wife, Dianne, and his sons Andrew and Eric. In a statement on Twitter, current NBA commissioner Adam Silver wrote, ""Every member of the NBA family is the beneficiary of David's vision, generosity and inspiration.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/01/792919610/david-stern-one-of-the-most-influential-nba-commissioners-is-dead-at-77
['Tom Goldman'],2020-01-01,Sports Journalism Shifts To Cover More Hard-Edged Topics,"Sports Journalism Shifts To Cover More Hard-Edged Topics

Media coverage of college sports has been a mix of entertainment and boosterism. But today, as college athlete rights have become a major issue, the journalism is getting more hard-edged.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

New Year's traditionally is one of the biggest days in college sports - prominent bowl games. Think the Rose Bowl. They command the sports media's attention. In recent years, though, college sports coverage has shifted away from a singular focus on entertainment. There's more hard-edged reporting on issues such as paying athletes or the disproportionate power and wealth of university athletic departments. NPR's Tom Goldman has this story about a journalist who has embraced the shift and become a college sports gadfly with plenty of targets.

TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: With his new journalistic venture, The Intercollegiate, Daniel Libit wants to examine college sports skeptically. He knows he's treading on sacred ground.

DANIEL LIBIT: I am totally appreciative and empathetic and have experienced the emotional connection to a college sports team.

GOLDMAN: He was a fan.

LIBIT: My lasting memories with my mom was going to watch New Mexico Lobo basketball games.

GOLDMAN: But the 37-year-old former political reporter decided it's more important to move beyond fandom and train his sights on a multi-billion-dollar college sports industry inextricably linked to the American higher education system, a link he just doesn't get.

LIBIT: I continue to fail to see what any of this has to do with higher ed.

GOLDMAN: There is, he acknowledges, value in college athletes getting an education they might not have otherwise and value in athletic competition. But all too often, Libit says, what happens in college sports has less to do with the benefit and education of athletes and more to do with winning for the athletic department.

LIBIT: Bringing in more donors, bringing in more revenue. And that revenue ultimately goes to pay for salaries for an executive class of athletic administrator and coach, who's the real beneficiary of this system.

GOLDMAN: A system Libit began scrutinizing full time three years ago.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: It is a mess. The state auditor's report on UNM's athletics department paints a picture of a department that did not understand basic accounting rules.

GOLDMAN: The University of New Mexico, Libit's alma mater, proved to be fertile ground. He helped unearth those financial problems with the athletic department. Fueled by endless public records requests, Libit broke a bunch of stories, including how the athletic department's problems threatened the university's accreditation. This year, Libit decided to expand his focus. He figured New Mexico's problems were reflected in many athletic departments. At the end of October, he launched The Intercollegiate, what he calls a watchdog journalism project that includes a website, newsletter and a podcast.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

LUKE CYPHERS: Hello.

LIBIT: Hey, Luke.

CYPHERS: Daniel.

LIBIT: All right.

GOLDMAN: Longtime sports journalist Luke Cyphers joined Libit on the project. They talk stories regularly, Libit in Chicago, Cyphers in New York.

LIBIT: I'm, like, trying to break away from doing name, image, likeness stuff for an issue.

CYPHERS: Yeah. Well, I don't think that's terrible to keep it going because it's on the front burner right now. It's what everyone's talking about.

GOLDMAN: Athlete compensation is a big story right now after California passed its law allowing college athletes to be paid for the use of their name, image or likeness. But there are many more issues where Libit and Cyphers want to turn their attention - athlete health and safety and athlete abuse. Larry Nassar's serial sexual abuse at Michigan State has been a major story. But abuse in all its forms is a common and underreported phenomenon at schools across the country.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Rebound by Otto. And that will do it. That was an explosive first half for UC Riverside, a dominant one.

GOLDMAN: The women's basketball team at the University of California Riverside, for instance, has been embroiled in an abuse scandal over the past year.

GIULIANA MENDIOLA: My name's Giuliana Mendiola. I'm an assistant women's basketball coach.

GOLDMAN: Or at least Giuliana Mendiola was a coach, a popular coach for seven years at UC Riverside. Last summer, the school didn't renew her contract. During her tenure, she raised concerns with school officials about the team's longtime head coach, who resigned three months ago after an investigation. Now Mendiola's speaking out about what she says was the coach's pattern of emotional and verbal abuse.

MENDIOLA: During one of our games, he called a player a [expletive] loser. Excuse my language, but that's the words he used.

GOLDMAN: Mendiola says the coach pressured players to return quickly from injuries, or else they'd lose their position on the team or lose playing time.

Did he ever threaten scholarships?

MENDIOLA: Yes, he did, absolutely.

GOLDMAN: UC Riverside is not an uncommon story, says Daniel Libit, especially in women's sports. He launched The Intercollegiate by printing reams of athlete exit interviews from schools. Some reveal stories of punitive and indiscriminate punishment or inappropriate personal comments by coaches. They are told by athletes finished with their careers. Former UC Riverside Coach Mendiola, who's suing the school for employment discrimination and retaliation, notes a lot of the public support she's gotten is from former players. She says current athletes often feel voiceless, unwilling to speak up or push back.

MENDIOLA: Because they're in fear. They're in fear of losing their scholarships. They're in fear of being threatened. It really bothers me because you're dealing with kids who aren't yet developed to deal with these kinds of things. So it allows the people in a position of power to continue to not just use their power but abuse their power over them because they know they can.

GOLDMAN: Daniel Libit says UC Riverside, like many schools, responded favorably to his records requests and provided exit interviews from the last year. Women's basketball was one of a handful of sports that didn't have the interviews. In a statement provided by the university, the athletic director said, the well-being of our student athletes, along with the culture and environment created for them, are of paramount concern to us. We take these matters very seriously.

When Libit released all those documents, he invited other journalists to dive into the records, so there could be an open collaboration. He says, in fact, his work is not as lonely as it once was. More mainstream college sports media are balancing boosterism with skepticism. And it's buoyed by shifting public attitudes. A recent survey by Seton Hall University showed 60% of those polled support college athletes getting paid for the use of their name, image or likeness. Libit says the plates are shifting beneath the feet of college sports, even inside that world, where he says some of his good sources work in athletic departments, including athletic directors.

LIBIT: There are people who like the gist of what I do because they are true reformers. They like college sports. They more or less like college sports as it exists today. They just want to sand off some of the rough edges.

GOLDMAN: How long before significant sanding? That's anyone's guess. The NCAA is an organization notoriously slow to reform. For Daniel Libit, that's OK. It means more work. Tom Goldman, NPR News.

[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly say the University of New Mexico is Daniel Libit's alma mater. It is actually his hometown college.]

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP Jae C. Hong/AP

Updated on Jan. 2 at 4:55 p.m. ET

California can now begin enforcing new minimum standards for light bulb efficiency, a federal judge ruled Tuesday. It's the latest split between the state and the Trump administration, which has moved to reverse the same standards on a national level.

The judge rejected a petition for a temporary block by two industry groups, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association and the American Lighting Association. The ALA says it's ""conferring with counsel on next steps.""

The standards were adopted by the California Energy Commission (CEC) after the Trump administration recently moved to roll them back.

The light bulb efficiency standards originally passed under President George W. Bush, then were expanded during the Obama administration. That expanded version includes specialty light bulbs like those used in bathroom vanities and recessed lighting, as well as candle-shaped lights.

The Obama-era rule aimed to phase out all incandescent and halogen bulbs, and replace them with LED bulbs that meet a minimum energy efficiency of 45 lumens per watt. (Still not up on your lumens-watt conversion? Here's some help!)

According to the Energy Department, LED bulbs are among the most energy efficient in the market today, using 75-80% less energy than regular ones.

In November, 16 states, including California and New York, sued the federal government over its reversal of the latest standards, and the California Energy Commission decided to adopt the original federal legislation. That's when the two industry groups petitioned for a temporary restraining order.

The judge denied that petition Tuesday, saying the efficiency standards have ""garnered significant support from consumer groups.""

The judge's decision ""keeps California at the forefront of the movement to resist the Trump Department of Energy's efforts to tie Americans to the technology of the past,"" said Noah Horowitz, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), in a statement.

According to the NRDC, the new standards will save California residents up to $2.4 billion on their annual utility bills.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/01/792885422/california-will-enforce-the-energy-efficient-lightbulb-rule-trump-wants-to-rever

Grim trends

A record number of people will need humanitarian assistance

The United Nations is predicting that 168 million people, a record, will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather, large infectious-disease outbreaks and intensifying, protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries. That's around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019, and the number is expected to continue to rise, up to 200 million people by 2022. The U.N. expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to $29 billion.

Hot spots include Burkina Faso, where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people; the Philippines, where a Christmas Eve typhoon killed more than two dozen; and Venezuela, where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years.

Shannon Scribner, associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at Oxfam America, says that funding to respond to these crises ""is not keeping pace with the need, and that will continue to be a challenge.""

Scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international NGOs that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict-affected areas such as Syria and Yemen.

""Humanitarian law isn't being upheld in some of the countries where we're working,"" says Scribner. ""And we don't see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did.""

One key solution, she says: Channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately, rather than big international NGOs. — Tim McDonnell

Second-tier diseases will go gangbusters

Over the last 12 months, the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers — HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. But other illnesses, some of them easily preventable, stole the limelight.

Those second-tier diseases include measles and dengue, which did gangbusters in the tropics. Cholera raged in Yemen. Polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat. In Pakistan, polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018. In a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort, a dozen countries that had been polio free (including China, Angola and the Philippines) reported cases of vaccine-derived polio in 2019. Venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country's health care system continues its downward spiral. Despite efforts to rein it in, a few cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the Middle East, and that will probably continue in the coming year.

Recent high-profile measles outbreaks in the U.S., Europe, the Philippines and Samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year. To prevent outbreaks, the World Health Organization says that roughly 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles. More than half the countries in the world, including the U.S. at 94%, haven't reached that threshold, according to UNICEF. Where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020? Afghanistan, Angola, Bolivia and Haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40%.

But there are some signs of progress: This year, a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years. And the world is more prepared to deal with Ebola than at any time in history: Two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use, all developed after the 2014 West Africa outbreak. The current Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world's ability to battle this virus. If there's an Ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020, it would likely be contained and crushed quickly. — Jason Beaubien

Aid will become even more political

""It seems we're returning to the bad old days of the Cold War when we used aid as a glorified payoff for [political] friends and allies,"" says Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and former U.S. foreign disaster assistance chief under the Obama administration.

Instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development, Konyndyk says there's a growing mentality in the U.S. that aid can be used as a ""goody bag"" to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line. Examples include Trump's freezing and reinstatement of aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies; his threats to cut off countries that don't vote with the U.S. at the United Nations; and his withdrawal of aid to Palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan.

The U.K. has also announced plans to merge its Department for International Development into its Foreign Office, a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing U.K. aid. These shifts by the U.S. and U.K., two of the world's largest aid donors, could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world, says Konyndyk. — Joanne Lu

Unrest over inequality will grow

2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world, and according to some experts, the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020.

Since the 1980s, income inequality has been on the rise, says Lucas Chancel, co-director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics. In the U.S., for example, Chancel says the richest 1% owned about 40% of the nation's wealth in 2016 — up from 20% in the 1980s — and Trump's 2017 tax policies have only ""turbocharged"" inequality, with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of American households.

""It is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different,"" he says, meaning inequality will deepen, despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it.

Part of the problem is that inequality has a ""new face,"" according to a new report by the United Nations Development Programme. People are no longer just angry about income; they're concerned about inequalities in political representation and power, higher education, access to technology and the resources to survive climate change.

Chancel says the protests in Chile, France, Lebanon, Hong Kong and other countries demonstrate that ""governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation"" and have yet to provide adequate solutions. Until they do, the UNDP report warns, the social unrest will likely continue. — Joanne Lu

Water taps continue to run dry

In June 2019, Chennai, India, reached ""Day Zero"" — the day on which the city's reservoirs ran almost completely out of water. By the fall, seasonal rains had resupplied the city, at least temporarily. But the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020.

In India alone, 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020, according to a government report. And an August report from the World Resources Institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one-quarter of the global population — including Botswana, India, Iran and Mexico — are using as much or more water than they can replace.

Upmanu Lall, director of the Columbia Water Center, says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity, in many cases Day Zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources.

""I haven't seen any reasonable improvement,"" he says. ""So I think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a Day Zero this year.""

The Indian subcontinent is a prime candidate, he says. But on the plus side, climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for El Niño and La Niña, the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others. The absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity.

Either way, Victoria Beard, an urban planning professor at Cornell University and World Resources Institute fellow, says water scarcity will continue to be a problem, especially in cities, until governments of high-risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems.

""People are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services,"" she says. ""There's no self-provision [of bottled water] that's going to solve this problem in the long term. There are no examples where it's a free-for-all and it works out well. You need coordinated massive public investment."" — Tim McDonnell

Gender equality is not on the horizon

The U.N. calls gender equality a ""necessary foundation"" for a peaceful and prosperous world. Yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality, as defined by the U.N.'s sustainable development goals, by 2030.

2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality: It's the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women's rights. The global community will be taking stock of progress — and lack thereof — at gatherings such as that of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in March.

Worldwide, women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence, less access to economic and educational opportunities, and exclusion from decision-making roles at the community and governmental levels.

By one measure, the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century. The most current estimate by the World Economic Forum — which publishes an annual report to track country-by-country progress across economic, educational, health and political dimensions — is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99.5 years at the current rate.

While the WEF report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment, which could be possible in as soon as 12 years, progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding. By that metric, parity is a ""lowly 57.8%"" and will take 257 years to overcome. — Emily Vaughn

Hopeful trends

Global health will get woke

This year, expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when Western countries colonized poor countries, stripping them of resources and autonomy. People who work in the field know that much of the money, influence and decision-making about how to help low-income countries still comes from wealthy countries — with little input from the people who receive the assistance.

One reason for this mindset, says Renzo Guinto, a Filipino physician and a member of The Lancet Planetary Health's editorial board, is the colonial roots of tropical medicine. In the colonial era, European researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers — not the people living in those places — from getting sick.

Over the past couple of years, he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change. They aim to give medical professionals in low-income countries real leadership roles. At the university level, students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field's colonial history in global health curriculum. And communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media. Many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags #ShiftThePower and #DecolonizeGlobalHealth.

Jennifer Lentfer, a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades, says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development. There are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject. In the coming weeks, Lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question Western motives to ""make a difference"" and help because it is our ""moral imperative."" And in January, graduate students at Duke University are organizing a conference called Decolonizing Global Health 2020.

""There's a real question as to how to flip the leadership,"" says Lentfer. ""And that's coming to a big head."" — Malaka Gharib

Satellite imagery could improve global health

This year, expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky-high point of view. Imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive — and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty, disease and environmental challenges.

Marshall Burke, deputy director of Stanford University's Center on Food Security and the Environment, is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them.

Let's say you run a government agency in a low-income country and want to identify the poorest 10% of villages — or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito-borne diseases. Satellite imagery can help you answer those questions, Burke says, in a way that's much less expensive and time-consuming than traditional boots-on-the-ground surveys. Cars, large buildings and well-tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space.

Satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the Sahel look for water and assisting regulators in West Africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining. It can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters. In some cases, it might help us peer into the future: In December, the World Resources Institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery, in conjunction with other data, to predict water shortages and conflicts.

In 2020, Burke says, expect to see more satellite-based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers. And although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the U.S. and the European Union, more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries — including Ethiopia's first observatory satellite, launched in late December. — Tim McDonnell

Youth activists will lead the fight for a better world

It's not just Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who seized Time's Person of the Year cover for 2019. Helena Gualinga, a teen Indigenous activist from the Ecuadorian Amazon, took world leaders to task at the COP 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of ""violating our human rights."" University students in India are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes Muslim migrants.

""Young people are in the lead,"" said U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres in a statement on Human Rights Day. ""Everywhere, they are marching against corruption, repression and inequality, and for human rights and human dignity.""

In 2020, youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see, says Jessica Taft, a youth-movement researcher and professor of Latin American studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

That kind of involvement by young people isn't new, Taft says. But what has changed, she says, is that today's social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other. With their phones set to retweet, they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away.

A common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make.

""Many of the issues that they're focusing on right now are ones that they're able to claim moral authority around as young people,"" says Taft. That includes topics such as climate change and gun violence, which young people can address from personal experience, like the students at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who captured the world's attention after the shooting at their school.

Matt Deitsch, a graduate of the school and an organizer of the March For Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C., told NPR in an interview in 2019: ""If we're not standing up and organizing ourselves, then we're not doing enough to save lives in America."" — Pien Huang

Cash will be king (of aid)

It's an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades: Instead of giving poor people goods and services — say, a cow or job training — why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it?

Interest in ""cash transfers"" — as this form of aid is often referred to — is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade, says David Evans, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C., think tank Center for Global Development.

One reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long-term effects of some of the earliest large-scale cash transfer programs — a series of government assistance schemes that began in Latin America in the late 1990s. Already ""we're starting to see the first wave of long-term evaluations,"" says Evans, who is on leave as a lead economist at the World Bank.

So far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short-term needs — like giving their families enough food each day — rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way. But these families were also able to give their children more schooling. And now that the kids are aging into the workforce, it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty. If so, says Evans, ""that will be an exciting thing to find."" — Nurith Aizenman

Access to college will boom

More and more people are going to college. Access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years, says Michael Green, CEO of Social Progress Imperative, and he expects it to continue in 2020.

Green and his organization, through its Social Progress Index, have been tracking this every year since 2014. Higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries, says Green, but many countries are making significant leaps, both in terms of enrollment and quality, and it's leading to a growing global middle class. Some of the biggest improvers, according to their data, include Morocco, Slovakia and Turkey.

Our World in Data, an online publication based at Oxford University, also expects the number of people around the world with higher-education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis projects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100, compared with 725 million in 2015. Although the improvement isn't in every country, Green says the rise in the global average is still a ""striking"" win. — Joanne Lu",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/02/792594559/heres-a-zine-of-grim-and-hopeful-global-trends-that-could-unfold-in-2020

At a time when jigsaw puzzles may be harder to come by than toilet paper, the hot new item in the Trump campaign online store is a 200-piece puzzle, featuring a faintly smiling President Trump standing in front of an American flag, giving two thumbs up.

The $35 puzzle is just the latest example of the campaign capitalizing on in-the-moment merchandise.

Interest in puzzles spiked with people spending much more time at home due to the coronavirus and in mid-April, the Trump campaign jumped on the trend.

Buying the Trump puzzle, or a Make America Great Again hat or T-shirt, is actually a campaign contribution. And this merch is an important part of the Trump reelection campaign's fundraising machine.

And that hasn't changed with the pandemic. The merchandise effort continued cranking, even as COVID-19 started grinding much of the American economy to a halt.

According to an NPR analysis of campaign finance reports, the Trump campaign and its affiliated committees spent more money in March on vendors that make its merchandise — about $4.7 million — than any other month since September 2016 — right in the heat of the president's first campaign.

And according to the digital marketing firm Bully Pulpit Interactive, about 10% of the campaign's overall Facebook ad spending this year has been explicitly to market merchandise. As the extent of the pandemic was becoming apparent at the end of March, that spending bumped up, as it often does at the end of a fundraising period.

""It's very much an e-commerce approach to political marketing,"" said Raquel Breternitz, who was the design director for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign.

She says selling merch enables campaigns to reach people who wouldn't ordinarily donate. It's easier to say ""Buy this cool hat"" than ""Please just give me money.""

""It feels different,"" Breternitz said of buying campaign merchandise. ""And it's very much a way of virtue signaling, depending on how you define virtue. But it's very much a way of saying, 'Here's what I believe, and I want to wear it on a T-shirt or wear it on a hat.' ""

""Whether it's the over one million red MAGA hats sold, plastic straws, or the new Trump-themed puzzle to keep people entertained during quarantine, the campaign merchandise lets supporters be part of this movement with high-quality, made in America Trump gear and products,"" Sarah Matthews, the deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign, said in a statement.

Trump's 2016 campaign was built around the red Make America Great Again hat, and it became an instant icon, a symbol of support for a candidate and much more. According to the campaign, it remains the top-selling item in the Trump campaign store, followed by the Keep America Great hat.

""We've sold millions and millions of red hats,"" Trump said at a Republican National Committee fundraiser last year. ""Now you go to a rally, everybody has the red hat.""

Of course, now no one is going to rallies. But people are still buying Trump gear. And as an added benefit, those shoppers turn over their contact information which can be used later to solicit donations, invite them to volunteer, or to make sure they vote.

The Trump campaign does a lot of what Breternitz calls rapid-response merch, capturing a moment and converting it into a product.

During the lead-up to impeachment, Trump was talking about former Vice President Joe Biden's son at a rally, asking, ""Where's Hunter?""

In the middle of his riff he said, ""Hey fellas, I have an idea for a new T-shirt.""

That night, there was a new $25 shirt in the Trump online store. The president claimed the next day that it was a best seller. It's not clear how many of the shirts really did sell. Campaigns now get their merchandise made on demand, so it's not like there are warehouses full of printed shirts and mugs.

The ultimate rapid response item is the Trump straws. Last July campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted grumpily about a paper straw disintegrating in his beverage.

Just five hours later, plastic Trump straws were available for purchase in the campaign store at a price of 10 for $15.

The campaign had tapped into something many people were annoyed with, fed the outrage, and then converted it to campaign cash.

""Liberal paper straws don't work. STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today,"" the item description said.

A campaign official says they've now sold more than $1 million worth of the plastic Trump straws.

The Warren campaign also gained notice for its rapid-response merch, including a hugely popular ""billionaire tears"" coffee mug.

But Breternitz says they worried about reputational risk with each new item, wanting to make sure it fit Warren's brand and wouldn't offend or otherwise come back to bite them. With the Trump campaign, she says there is seemingly less worry about being offensive ""because that's his brand and that's what people look for from him,"" Breternitz said. ""He can jump on any piece of outrage. He doesn't have to worry if it's true or not, and he can sell straws off of it.""

For the Trump campaign, this merch-forward approach is a point of pride, and it has helped fuel its small-dollar fundraising. In the first quarter of 2020, the Trump campaign, combined with the Republican National Committee, raised $212 million. That's even though Trump's last big-dollar in-person fundraiser was held on March 9.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/05/03/848561519/from-puzzles-to-plastic-straws-merch-plays-a-key-role-in-trumps-fundraising

Israel's top court is deciding if corruption charges should bar Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from forming a government.

Wearing face masks and separated by dividers, the 11 justices convened Sunday to discuss the fate of Netanyahu. The long-serving prime minister had recently reached an agreement with his election rival, Benny Gantz, to end a government deadlock. Opponents of Netanyahu, however, are claiming criminal charges — including bribery, fraud and breach of trust — should prevent him from leading the unity government.

The justices are expected to reach a decision this week.

A ruling against Netanyahu would be a serious blow to Israeli governance.Three elections — the most recent in March — have failed to conclusively decide the country's leadership.

Last month, however, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a deal between Netanyahu and Gantz to form an emergency government. The deal allows Netanyahu — already Israel's longest-serving prime minister — to remain in his role through October of next year before handing over leadership to Gantz.

The deal had been supported by Israel's parliament. But opposition parties and watchdogs petitioned Israel's supreme court to block Netanyahu's leadership as he faced a series of corruption charges.

Israeli law doesn't force a sitting prime minister to step down if indicted, though Netanyahu is the first Israeli leader to be indicted while in office.

Netanyahu faces charges in three corruption cases. The most serious stem from an alleged attempt to garner positive media coverage by promoting regulations that would favor a telecommunications company. Netanyahu has denied the allegations and said they are politically-motivated.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/05/03/849826793/israels-high-court-to-decide-if-netanyahu-can-form-government

North and South Korean forces briefly traded gunfire along the country's heavily-patrolled border on Sunday morning, according to the South's military.

The government-funded Yonhap News Agency reports that South Korean soldiers heard gunshots around 7:41 a.m. local time and found four bullet holes on a guard post located inside the Demilitarized Zone. The soldiers fired back — a total of 20 rounds — and broadcast warnings in accordance with military protocols, according to the country's Joint Chiefs of Staff.

No casualties were reported on the South Korean side and the act did not appear to be an ""intentional provocation,"" the Yonhap goes on to say, citing a military official. No damage or deaths have been reported by North Korea.

The officer quoted by Yonhap also says the incident occurred in foggy conditions at a time when North Korean soldiers typically rotate shifts. The source adds that no unusual military movements had been detected ahead of the gunshots.

Prior to Sunday's morning exchange, no skirmishes have been reported at the shared border the since 2017 when North Korean soldiers fired on one of their own during a daring defection attempt.

Both countries subsequently signed a deal to ease tensions between the two countries in 2018, but South Korean officials say the exchange violates that agreement and urged their neighbor to abide the accord.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR Ash Ponders for NPR

More Americans than ever before are expected to vote by mail this year because of concerns about the coronavirus. One challenge facing election officials now: how to print and mail the millions of ballots voters are expected to request in the coming months.

Nearly a quarter of the 136 million presidential ballots cast 2016 were mailed in. That number could easily grow to well over half this year, especially if the health risk continues.

With many states expected to expand mail-in voting for November, experts warn that existing ballot printing services could quickly become overwhelmed.

One of of the biggest such vendors in the country is Runbeck Election Services. The company's 90,000-square-foot facility in Phoenix, Ariz., is already bustling, and things are expected to get a lot busier soon.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR Ash Ponders for NPR

""This year we are going to mail probably around 40 to 50 million pieces. We'll print probably close to 80 million, up to 100 million pieces when you count inserts,"" said Jeff Ellington, the company's president and chief operating officer. He gave NPR a virtual tour of the facility via FaceTime because pandemic travel restrictions prevented an in-person visit.

Ellington explained that getting ballots to the right voters is a complicated, multi-step process. States need to decide what their ballots will look like and to get approval from the U.S. Postal Service for the design of the envelopes. After those envelopes are secured, companies like Runbeck step in.

""So I'm on the production floor looking at one of our HP printing presses and it takes a roll of paper that starts out at a thousand pounds, and then it goes through the machine, gets printed, and then gets trimmed to size,"" Ellington said, adding that the machine can print about 20,000 ballots an hour.

Standing near the printer are stacks of massive rolls of white paper that will eventually become ballots for millions of American voters. On this day, the company is producing mailings for Iowa, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia. The latter's ballots need to be delivered quickly for Georgia's June 9 primary, which was delayed from March due to the pandemic.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR Ash Ponders for NPR

Ellington shows how another machine folds the ballots, which emerge in neat stacks and are put in plastic bins by workers. They're then taken over to another machine called an inserter. On this day, the inserter puts ballots, instructions and an ""I voted"" sticker into envelopes for Las Vegas voters.

""You'll see the ballots being loaded, going down a conveyor belt and then inserted into an envelope,"" Ellington said.

This is one of the most sensitive parts of the process. Each ballot has a bar code that tells the machine exactly what kind of ballot it is — there can be thousands of varieties in a single election — and then determines from a database of voter registration records which person on the list should receive that particular ballot.

""And then your name and address will be printed on the envelope once that process is complete,"" said Ellington.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR Ash Ponders for NPR

Runbeck already has five inserters and has ordered 11 more — the most its manufacturer can produce by November. Ellington said this will triple the company's capacity, but is unlikely to meet what's expected to be this year's unprecedented demand with so many voters nervous about going to the polls in person.

His company and others are warning states to decide soon what they plan to do or they could be out of luck.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR Ash Ponders for NPR

""Decision-making needs to be right now,"" CEO Kevin Runbeck told the U.S. Election Assistance Commission at a recent online hearing about holding an election during a pandemic. ""We cannot gear up, we cannot build equipment fast enough if you wait until July to place your orders.""

Kim Wyman, the secretary of state for Washington, which has a long history of widespread mail-in voting, also spoke about the challenges for states trying to quickly shift to a lot more absentee voting.

""They're going to need high-speed envelope sorters. They're going to need tabulation equipment that can actually count ballots in a faster manner,"" she warned.

And those are only a few things election officials need to consider, Wyman said.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Ash Ponders for NPR Ash Ponders for NPR

Among the other questions: Do states have their voter registration records digitized so ballots can be sent out efficiently and signatures verified? How will all those ballots be opened and counted on Election Day? Is there enough paper available to provide millions of envelopes on such short notice?

That's not to mention educating voters about how to use a form of voting they might not be used to.

""I am very concerned that with only six months really to implement vote-by-mail or absentee voting in a jurisdiction that it's going to be a heavy lift, and if it's not rolled out properly, we will lose confidence in the results of the election,"" Wyman told the commission.

Some states, like Wisconsin and Ohio, have already run into glitches switching to largely vote-by-mail primaries at the last minute.

Back in Phoenix, Jeff Ellington is worried too.

""There's approximately 200 million registered voters in the country. And we will have the capacity to do approximately 20 million [absentee ballots],"" he said.

Disney World has been closed since the middle of March, but that didn't stop a man from camping on an abandoned island at the park.

A 42-year-old Alabama man was arrested on Thursday at Disney World's Discovery Island, telling deputies he was unaware he was trespassing and called the island a ""tropical paradise,"" according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies noted there were numerous ""no trespassing"" signs posted.

Authorities charged him with one count of trespassing, a misdemeanor. He was also banned from all Disney properties.

According to the arrest report, the man ""stated that he had made entry to the island to go camping on Monday or Tuesday and had planned on staying on the island for approximately one week.""

Disney security first spotted the man camping on the island, which has been closed to the public since 1999. Deputies with the Orange County Sheriff's Office searched for him with helicopters, boats and on foot.

The man told deputies he didn't hear them calling out to him on a loudspeaker because he was sleeping inside one of the buildings on the island.

Discovery Island was originally called Treasure Island and is located in Bay Lake in Disney World.

The 11-acre island opened in 1974 and became a zoo, featuring 130 species of animals. ""Most are birds, but the park also has Galapagos tortoises and ring-tailed lemurs,"" the Orlando Sentinel reported in 1999 as the park was preparing to close.

State leaders are considering reopening economies and allowing people to leave their homes, but more and more Americans appear to be doing so on their own.

Emerging data suggest that though people dramatically altered their habits to stay at home during the first month of America's response to the pandemic, that cooperation has since leveled off and — eventually — decreased. This could point to long-term challenges for state governments asking citizens to cooperate with extended stay-at-home policies.

The data, provided to NPR by a mobile phone location data company called SafeGraph, is based on the locations of about 18 million mobile phones across the country. NPR's analysis determined the percentage of cellphones that did not leave their ""home"" location daily in every U.S. county.

Loading...

About 50% of those mobile phones that SafeGraph had data on stayed home on April 12, which was Easter — the highest point in the data. That number hasn't since come anywhere close, showing a steady decline with the most recent numbers showing that less than 40% stayed home on April 27.

The trend, SafeGraph says, is consistent across the entire country, though the degree to which movement is increasing is different. Some counties showed extreme drop-offs in social distancing, while some showed more mild curves.

""Regardless of what the orders say or the governors say, we're seeing the whole country softening up,"" says Nick Singh, a marketing lead at SafeGraph.

The data provided was anonymized, meaning the locations of exact devices were hidden, with only general trends shown. Companies collecting mobile phone locations have been criticized over privacy concerns, though several have provided their data to researchers during the coronavirus crisis. The data from SafeGraph, which says it tracks only users who have ""opted in"" via mobile apps, was cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an April report on COVID-19.

What these metrics don't account for is how people practice social distancing when they leave their homes. A picnic in an empty park, for example, would be counted the same as a trip to a crowded grocery store.

A tracker developed by the University of Maryland in cooperation with the U.S. Transportation Department found similar trends. UMD said the change was mostly driven by people going on nonwork trips — not from more people going to work.

Sepehr Ghader, the senior researcher on the UMD project, says it's too soon to know exactly why people are leaving their homes in larger numbers — though he calls the trend ""social distancing fatigue.""

""It might be due to people getting tired of staying at home or it could be due to people reacting to the news that states are being reopened,"" Ghader says. ""We can't really say why this trend is happening ... but we can certainly see the trend in decrease of social distancing metrics.""

Sharp drop-offs

On April 20 in Arlington County, Va., nearly half of cellphones that SafeGraph provided data for were staying at home. Over the next couple days in that suburb of Washington, D.C., the number declined to one-third — as low as it was during the middle of March. It has since increased but is still down from its peak.

Loading...

Jim Schwartz, the deputy manager for Arlington County, said the county will have to continue its messaging efforts to keep people at home.

""Enforcement for that is difficult. We're not in a police state,"" he said. ""We are trying to encourage people to follow the guidance of our public health officials ... I would think that people may be experiencing — in a colloquial term — cabin fever.""

Several of the other counties that had stay-at-home numbers fall off the most are in Texas. Cameron, Comal and Hidalgo counties all saw declines starting around April 6. These counties have not seen especially high death tolls from the disease, indicating there may be some optimism among residents that they can leave their homes with fewer risks. Texas on Friday allowed some businesses to open at reduced capacity.

Loading...

Esmeralda Guajardo, the health administrator for Cameron County, says news and announcements from the state's governor and President Trump have sent mixed messages, giving people the impression that it may be OK to not adhere to the shelter-in-place order.

""Anytime there's some confusion, people are going to take advantage of it."" Guajardo says. ""I completely understand the anxiety that people have about staying home. But coming from a public heath perspective, it's a necessity.""

Meanwhile, the New York City borough of Queens — which has had the highest number of confirmed coronavirus deaths in the city, according to the city's health department — is one of the places where social distancing appears to have continued. Roughly 60% of people in the SafeGraph sample there stayed at home every day during the month of April, with only a slight decrease near the end of the month.

Loading...

The path forward

As dozens of states plan to partially reopen, the number of people staying at home will likely decrease further.

Governors who have chosen not to reopen have faced opposition from both residents and leaders in their states. In Michigan, armed protestors entered the state Capitol Thursday demanding an end to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's statewide emergency. In Southern California, two cities said they would go to court to stop Gov. Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, from closing beaches.

The White House's own strict social distancing guidelines expired Thursday. Trump is advising states to develop strategies to reopen that would include social distancing measures.

Updated at 11:15 a.m. ET

With near-daily task force briefings, President Trump has delivered an ever-evolving message to the American public about the coronavirus pandemic.

The constant is the inconsistency. At times he has been in sync with the public health experts advising him on the response and with actions initiated by his administration. But often he has undercut or even contradicted his experts or White House policy.

Trump has gone from downplaying the risk early on, to overselling the availability of test kits, to encouraging strict social distancing measures, to questioning whether those measures were causing too much economic and emotional pain. He has claimed ""total"" authority and then insisted it's really up to the states to manage the response.

As the message from public health experts became increasingly dire, Trump often accentuated the positive, saying he was trying to give Americans hope.

Although Trump's partial ban on travelers from China is seen by many as having bought time for the U.S. to prepare, coronavirus testing failures obscured the severity of the outbreak here and hampered efforts to contain its spread. By the time the deadly scope of the virus came into focus, it was too late for containment, and mitigation shutdowns brought a heavy economic toll.

Enlarge this image toggle caption vgajic/Getty Images vgajic/Getty Images

Each week we answer some of your pressing questions about the coronavirus and how to stay safe. Email us your questions at goatsandsoda@npr.org with the subject line: ""Weekly Coronavirus Questions."" This week, we're considering questions about pulse oximeters.

As the coronavirus continues to spread, a small medical device called a pulse oximeter has started to fly off the shelves. In fact, demand has spiked to such an extraordinary degree that you may not be able to buy one right now in your local pharmacy or online.

What is the value of the device during this pandemic? Do you need to have one at home? The first question is relatively easy to answer. The second is a little more complicated.

What is it?

A pulse oximeter is a small electronic device that estimates the saturation of oxygen in your blood. You want a number in the 95% to 100% range. If the number drops to 92% or lower, that's a cause for concern. That's generally the level where a doctor might put you on supplementary oxygen and keep you in the hospital for observation.

To come up with that percentage, the device clamps onto your finger or earlobe and shoots different wavelengths of light through the small capillaries, explains Dr. Richard Levitan, a New Hampshire-based emergency room physician who specializes in airway management. (For a more thorough scientific explanation, read this.)

The term for low blood oxygen levels is hypoxemia. In this condition, your body's organs may not work right. Severe cases can interfere with heart or brain function.

You've likely had your blood oxygen monitored by a pulse oximeter already. It's used during some physical exams and is considered essential during operations and intensive care. The devices also give your heart rate.

Why are these devices suddenly getting so much attention?

COVID-19 can bring on what's called COVID pneumonia — an infection in which the lung's air sacs fill with fluid or pus. And it's possible that someone infected with the novel coronavirus might be in the early stages of COVID pneumonia – including a drop in blood oxygen level — without experiencing any difficulty breathing.

In such cases, a pulse oximeter might signal that you're in trouble before you realize it. That's what Levitan saw when he spent 10 days working in the ER at Bellevue Hospital in New York City earlier this month: Many COVID patients were already very sick with COVID pneumonia by the time they arrived. They were breathing rapidly, their blood oxygen levels dangerously low. Like mountain climbers, the patients had grown accustomed to gradually decreasing levels of oxygen and didn't realize they were in distress.

Many of them said they only recently started feeling short of breath though they had experienced symptoms of COVID-19 for days. By the time the patients went to the hospital, says Levitan, the virus had already damaged their lungs, and many were in critical condition. He saw COVID pneumonia patients with oxygen saturation levels as low as 50 percent.

""These COVID patients have adapted to this slow, insidious drop in their oxygen and they don't know it,"" he told NPR. ""Then when they come in with shortness of breath, it is late in the process."" In his opinion, a pulse oximeter could have caught the warning sign of low blood oxygen level earlier on.

The disease ""kills by silently causing [a decrease in] oxygen. When you come in late in the disease, which is basically everybody who we now have coming to the E.R., there is a high mortality,"" he says.

Levitan says that in medicine, earlier treatment leads to better results — ""and that's true of COVID, as well.""

Should you get one?

Levitan thinks that in the midst of a respiratory pandemic, it makes sense to have a pulse oximeter at home – just as you might have a thermometer to track fevers. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, he says, like weakness, muscle aches or fever, you could use the device to measure blood oxygen levels.

That 92% figure (or lower) is a sign that ""you should get evaluated because this disease kills silently and you don't have to have significant shortness of breath"" to be at risk. (Although people at high altitudes might have levels ""in the low 90s and be fine,"" he adds.)

Dr. Elissa Perkins, a professor of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center, doesn't necessarily think everyone needs to buy a pulse oximeter. She worries that people will depend on the device's reading rather than calling a doctor if they're feeling sick.

""I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that people should all have these at home,"" says Perkins, though she understands why people would want them.

""In general, I think honestly, if people are starting to feel symptoms or feel even a little bit short of breath, they should probably contact their physician, if possible,"" she says. ""Most places or many places at this point are offering telemedicine visits, telehealth visits and that can give a more thorough picture of what somebody is experiencing than just one number on a pulse oximeter.""

But she's not completely opposed to home pulse oximeters. She says if you have symptoms consistent with the novel coronavirus, using a pulse oximeter and consulting with a doctor can be a good strategy.

She is concerned about one risk: People could be falsely reassured by good numbers into thinking they're not very sick. People with COVID ""can get incredibly dehydrated, people can get very weak,"" says Perkins. ""We've seen people fainting or passing out, who don't have particular respiratory symptoms and don't have shortness of breath. So it's another piece of data, but it's certainly not the only piece of data.""

There are other concerns. The reading can be less accurate if a person is wearing nail polish or artificial nails, has cold hands or poor circulation.

It's possible to accidentally read the numbers upside down and panic over a seemingly eye-popping number. Or the device itself could be inaccurate.

The American Lung Association chief medical officer Albert Rizzo issued a statement on Thursday advising against ""buying pulse oximeters unnecessarily.""

""[U]nless you have a chronic lung or heart condition that affects your oxygen saturation level on a regular basis, most individuals do not need to have a pulse oximeter in their home,"" Rizzo said. ""Most importantly, if you're interested in purchasing a pulse oximeter for home use, please discuss the necessity and use of the device with your health-care provider. A medical professional can determine if it would be helpful and also provide direction for interpreting the readings in the context of how you are feeling. Your pulse oximeter reading should be used along with your other symptoms such as shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, as parameters that would prompt a call to your doctor.""

Abraar Karan, internal medicine doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, is a proponent of caution as well when it comes to pulse oximeters for home use. He says it remains to be seen how predictive low oxygen levels are at correctly identifying patients who will have a severe course with the disease. He points to a recent study looking at 5,700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City, which found only 27.8% needed supplemental oxygen at triage.

And he shares Perkins' concern about people being either falsely comforted or unnecessarily alarmed.

""What we don't want to happen is that people are in real distress but think that because their home pulse oximeter reads normal, that they are fine,"" Karan writes via email. ""We also need to make sure that patients are using the pulse oximeter properly and that it is reading correctly — otherwise, you could have more people coming to the emergency room that may not need to be there.""

But Levitan says that kind of strain on ERs already happens when people interpret home blood pressure monitors or thermometers incorrectly. A much bigger concern, Levitan says, is people dying suddenly from COVID. And he doesn't worry that the device will just make people more anxious: ""You know what? We've got fear. We've got anxiety. We need reassurance.""

Where do I buy one — and how worried should I be if there's a delay in getting it?

If you do think a pulse oximeter would be valuable, Levitan suggests buying one from a medical source like a pharmacy rather than a random site on the internet – and it's a good idea to look for one that's been FDA-approved, if possible. You can go to the FDA's 510(k) Premarket Notification page here and search for ""oximeter.""

It's possible to buy devices that haven't been approved for medical use, and such devices may be less accurate.

Just a few months ago, it would have been easy to find consumer models costing about $30 typically on pharmacy shelves. They are often used by people with chronic lung disease who are taking supplemental oxygen to make sure they were getting the right amount of oxygen.

With many pharmacies sold out, people are turning to sites like eBay and Amazon, where devices can be found in the $60 range.

But Levitan says you shouldn't fret if you have to wait a few weeks to get one: ""You know what? We have 12 to 24 months of this [coronavirus],"" he predicts.

He says in an age of respiratory pandemics, there is very useful health monitoring that people can do form home, in concert with a phone call to a medical professional.

""We need to change the public perception of what health monitoring means in this age of respiratory pandemics,"" he says. ""When you combine heart rate measurement, oxygen saturation and temperature, which are all three things you can do at home — and especially if you combine it with a phone call to your doctor or to your local emergency department ... that's incredibly informative.""",npr,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/05/01/848400469/coronavirus-faqs-whats-a-pulse-oximeter-is-it-a-good-idea-to-buy-one

With the U.S. at the epicenter of a global pandemic, therapy sessions (or goals to start them) might be taking a back seat. But between telecommuting, home schooling, unemployment woes, toilet paper shortages and an ever-present sense of doom, mental health care is more important than ever.

A new poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 45% of adults say the pandemic has affected their mental health. But as states battle the spread of the coronavirus with stay-at-home orders, people can't attend their regular therapy sessions.

Good news: There are ways to start or continue therapy right where you are. Some are even free.

Shereen Marisol Meraji, Life Kit guest host and co-host of NPR's Code Switch, talked to NPR's Lauren Hodges about some at-home therapy options.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

For people who aren't in therapy, why might they want to consider it now — especially when we can't walk into a therapist's office anytime soon?

Well, because this is a really stressful time! The news is scary and depressing, but we kind of have to stay on top of it, keep watching, keep reading to get the latest guidance from the government: How long are schools closed? Are we allowed outside? Which businesses are open?

We're also home-schooling kids, dealing with unemployment or less income, worried about sick friends and relatives. It's a lot. And it can be really helpful to talk to a third party, let off some steam and get a little advice to manage it.

What about cost? People are worried about money right now. Is therapy covered by insurance?

If you have insurance, it depends on the plan. Check your policy. Make sure it's covered. And your insurance company can also give you a list of options and names so you don't waste your time talking to people who don't take your insurance.

If you already have a therapist, just ask them how they can continue your sessions and if anything will change with their copays. Since this is such an unprecedented situation, they might still be figuring it out. That also could mean they're flexible and open to suggestions that could work for you.

What if you don't have insurance?

I know a lot of people are dealing with losing their insurance under their former employers. You do have options. You can ask for the sliding-scale rate, meaning the therapist works with you based on what you can afford. There's also this website called Open Path Collective, where therapists offer sessions for between $30 and $60. That's a pretty typical copay for insured patients. Call some of those people, ask how they're holding sessions right now and what they're doing to go online.

And it's worth mentioning during this national emergency, Medicare coverage will now include three types of virtual services: telehealth visits, virtual check-ins and e-visits. So if you have Medicare, a good way to use this benefit is to search for providers that accept it. I searched on Psychology Today, filtered for Medicare in the insurance option and found providers that take it.

If you already have a therapist, how easy is it to make this switch to online or teletherapy?

I talked to Seth Gillihan, a clinical psychologist in Philadelphia. He has switched all of his patient sessions online. He said it might feel weird for the first few minutes of that first video chat but that you'll hardly notice it after a while: ""What people seem to find is that you forget about the medium relatively quickly. I think about it kind of like watching a movie. At some point you stop being aware of the fact that you're staring at a screen, and you get really immersed in the story.""

So get set up on your phone or laptop, make sure you've downloaded the right app, find a comfortable, private spot away from your family or roommates. Go into a closet if you have to! Make sure your Wi-Fi is good. And just like regular therapy sessions, you can write down some stuff you want to talk about beforehand. Or you could just wing it and see what comes up for you.

One caveat I do want to mention: Make sure to ask your provider if they're licensed to treat you in whatever medium you're seeking therapy.

Is it still going to be effective?

I think it's pretty helpful to have that neutral person to process our frustrations and confusions with, no matter how we're talking to them. It can be tempting to talk to friends and family members about our problems because they're right there. But over time, that can be emotionally draining and taxing on our relationships. Therapists are trained professionals. They can give us advice, help us gain perspective. And they're bound by the law to keep things confidential. So that's a big plus with them.

Are there other options?

There are apps specifically designed for online therapy that use text and video messaging. They've been around for a couple years. So they were ahead of this whole curve. BetterHelp, Talkspace and Larkr are a few that come to mind. (We should mention that BetterHelp is an NPR sponsor.)

And there are a lot of support groups that have moved online right now. One of the more well-known ones is Alcoholics Anonymous. They've been using Zoom, Google Hangout[s] and conference calls to keep their members coming to meetings.

I went on Psychology Today and looked up local groups that meet all these different needs — grief counseling, anger management, addictions, whatever the issue is. And they all have group managers you can reach out to. Ask them how they're arranging these digital meetups. The best thing is a lot of these groups are free or low cost.

I also want to put out some free 24-hour hotlines for people who might not have Wi-Fi or who are just really struggling and really need to talk to someone right now, maybe on off hours or just don't have any money to spend on therapy or mental health counseling. The Department of Health and Human Services has the National Helpline. That's 1-800-662-4357. There's a group called Integral Care. They run a hotline with 15 languages. They're at 512-472-HELP.

And because this can feel like a really hopeless time for some people, I want to share the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is 1-800-273-8255. Please call if you're thinking of hurting yourself. There is definitely help waiting for you, no matter your situation.

Let's do a quick recap. What are the most important things to know about getting therapy right now?

It can feel really tempting to put your mental health on the back burner right now because there's so much happening. But you might need help more than ever. And it's not great to just constantly download that onto your friends and family because they're going through the same thing too. Therapists are trained professionals. They have confidentiality in mind. If you have insurance, you can ask your insurance company to help you find a provider or a method. And if you don't have insurance, there are lots of free options and low-cost options for you out there.

Have you ever noticed how tough it is to be present? We spend so much time planning and worrying about the future or dwelling on the past.

""We're in a trance of thinking. We're time traveling,"" says Tara Brach, a world-renowned psychologist and mindfulness teacher. ""We're in the future, we're in the past.""

And all this ruminating gets in the way of enjoying life — we can miss out on the good stuff.

If you reflect on your life, Brach asks, how often can you sense that the fear of failing or not being good enough ""was in some way dampening or contracting or pulling you away from real intimacy or spontaneity or enjoying a sunset?""

Life Kit host Allison Aubrey spoke with Brach about her latest book, Radical Compassion: Learning to Love Yourself and Your World with the Practice of RAIN. The book outlines the mindfulness tool, RAIN, an acronym for a four-step process: recognize, allow, investigate and nurture.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What is mindfulness at its core. Can you describe mindfulness in a sentence or two?

Mindfulness is paying attention to what's happening in the present moment without judgment.

What is the purpose? What is the benefit of paying attention to the present moment?

We step out of our thoughts about the past and the future, and we actually start occupying a space of presence that is bigger than the particular emotions or thoughts that are going on.

Mindfulness gives us more choice as to how we want to experience things, what we want to say, what we want to do. So instead of reacting, we can actually respond from more intelligence, more kindness. It actually lets us inhabit our best selves.

The ""R"" and the ""A"" in RAIN stand for Recognize and Allow — can you explain that?

So ""recognize"" comes when we realize on some level we're stuck. We're having a hard time. All we're doing with ""recognize"" is sensing whatever feeling is predominant in that moment. And it might be we simply say 'upset' or 'confused' or 'angry' or 'hurt'.

With ""allow"" you actually are pausing, saying 'it's OK.' Let's just let this be for a few moments. And that's the pause. That's the space we're creating that gives you the power and the freedom.

So the next step is ""I"" for investigate. What are some questions that you can ask to help yourself investigate?

Ask yourself 'what really wants my attention?' Ask what wants your attention right now and look into the body. Feel the throat, the chest, the belly. Another really good question is 'what am I believing right now?' Because I find for myself when I'm in a bad mood, usually I'm believing that in some way I fell short. I'm failing in some way.

And if I can identify it consciously, it doesn't affect me as much. The single most valuable finale with investigating is to ask the part of you that feels most vulnerable: 'so what do you need?' Is it love? Acceptance? Forgiveness? Feeling accompanied? Feeling embraced? Feeling safe?

The last letter in RAIN is ""N,"" which stands for nurture. Explain this one.

This step is all about learning to be kind to yourself and offering yourself what is needed. Often, to fight through the feelings of shame or anxiety, we have to work at this. The way I often do it is I put my hand on my heart and I'll say, ""it's okay sweetheart."" Or you might just say to yourself, ""I love you,"" or, ""It's okay, I'm here. I'm not leaving.""

Or, we can imagine that affirmation coming from someone else — a loved one, a spiritual figure, even a pet. The source doesn't matter as long as it's nurturing.

After RAIN, we can sense a shift in how we feel. We sense the quality of presence that's opened up from where we started to now.

For those of us not in the habit of nurturing ourselves, this can be a challenging step in the process. For instance, if I over-react to a situation, I later laugh at my lack of perspective. I realize that it wasn't a big deal, and I feel so much lighter when I'm able to laugh it off. Is this a form of nurturing?

Nurturing is any way that you create a larger, lighter, kinder space. And humor is fantastic. Often if I can laugh, I know the tangle is no longer dominating me.

And that's the thing with RAIN, it doesn't get rid of the waves of experience. It makes you more ocean-like. You have more perspective, more wisdom. Wisdom brings on humor. Wisdom brings on kindness. In other words, you're not suffering. What you're feeling is not pleasant, but you're not suffering.

So many of us are taught from a young age to be ambitious and aim high. How can we practice mindfulness and still achieve our goals?

What's interesting is that people have a fear that if they're mindful and present, they'll lose their motivation, that they won't be able to be so successful in the ways you're describing. But what I found is that anxiety actually leads to more mistakes, less empathy, less emotional intelligence and actually less effectiveness.

Where do you see this?

We train people in corporations and medical schools and they actually find mindfulness increases competency. Mindfulness doesn't remove motivation. It just allows us to be more centered and respond from our natural intelligence. Fear doesn't make us more intelligent.

Does mindfulness become easier the more you practice it?

Whatever you practice gets stronger. If you practice judging yourself every day, that gets stronger. If you practice recognizing, allowing, investigating, nurturing, that gets stronger and also quicker.

The real gift is that we start trusting our goodness. We start trusting the love and the awareness. Not only that, we start looking at each other and seeing that too. If we can trust the goodness, then we can help to bring it out in ourselves and each other.

For Joanna Levesque, who performs as JoJo, the freedom of her new album was over 15 years in the making.

JoJo was just 13 years old when her song ""Leave (Get Out)"" hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts in 2004. At the time, she was the youngest artist ever to hold that spot. ""Too Little Too Late,"" the lead single for her second album, made it even further to No. 3 on the Hot 100, and in 2008, JoJo promised fans on her Myspace page that her third album would arrive in time for her 18th birthday.

The album never came. In 2013, JoJo sued her label, Blackground Records and Da Family Records, and was released from her contract the following year. In 2018, she re-recorded and re-released her first two albums, JoJo (2004) and The High Road (2006), after they had been previously removed from streaming services. (Taylor Swift, who likewise doesn't own her masters, has stated she'll make a similar move in November.)

Her new album, Good To Know, is out now and is the third release from Clover Music, JoJo's imprint with Warner Records.

""I made this album from where I was at,"" she says. ""I was on a journey, wanting to accept myself and not keep running away from being alone.""

JoJo spoke to NPR about feeling powerless during her struggle with her former label, taking personal stock at 29 and being adaptable while releasing an album during a pandemic. Listen to the radio version in the audio player above and read on for highlights of the interview.

Interview Highlights

On learning to trust herself through writing Good To Know

I was kind of a casualty of some industry things that were out of my control and some bad business and I really hated feeling so powerless. In this album and on this journey through the writing of it from the inception to the end, I found my voice. I found my power. And that feels so exhilarating and intoxicating.

I did internalize a lot of things that were happening, and ended up being a product of the environments or the situations that I was in. And it wasn't just the situation with my former label. I hate the fact that part of my story really is a lot about industry politics, and moving musical chairs and executives. That is so distracted from what I've always wanted to do, which is just make music. And unfortunately this is a business and this is not just about music, because I'm the kind of person who takes a lot of accountability and wants to think ""What could I do different?"" or ""How could I have contributed to this situation?"" — it made me be like, ""There must be a problem with me.""

On the song ""Pedialyte"" and overdoing it

I remember when I was around college-age, just hearing that people were using Pedialyte as a hangover cure, so I figured that would be the right title for the song about the morning after a big night, when you're looking at yourself and you're like ""Damn, what did I do? What am I doing?""

YouTube

I wouldn't even really identify my addictive tendencies as one particular thing. It's been love, attention, substances, food. I've overdone it because I've felt a void. I'm just being transparent about it. I felt a void that I think a lot of people feel and maybe don't get to address. But I've done a lot of deep diving over the past couple of years, and just really wanted to work on myself and come out of my 20s feeling like I'm the best version of myself on all levels. A reckoning needed to happen. An inventory needed to be taken.

On how the pandemic has changed her album release and relationship with fans

My connection with my fans has been central to my survival, not only as an artist in this game, but as a person. It really has fueled me and given me confidence and courage. So to not be able to get out and energetically exchange with them in the same way is just different. But everybody is going through that adjustment, and our industry is having to adapt.

But thank God for technology. I'm really grateful that we can interact on social media and through different apps, because it keeps me feeling not alone and like this music is reaching people at a time where I think we need music more than ever.

The Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments remotely for the next two weeks, and for the first time in history, the audio will be available, live, to the public. The arguments include high-profile cases about birth control access, religious freedom, the Electoral College and President Trump's financial records.

They are scheduled to take place Monday through Wednesday on the weeks of May 4 and May 11, beginning at 10 a.m. ET each day. You can listen to all of the cases here:

For each case, both sides will have the same amount of time. Each side will have two minutes of uninterrupted argument at the beginning. After that, each justice has been allotted two minutes for questioning, with more questions permitted if there is time left at the end of the first round. Each side has a total of 30 minutes.

The justices will speak in order of seniority: After Chief Justice John Roberts, it will be Justices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

Here's a rundown of the cases:

Monday, May 4: Booking.com trademark

10 a.m. ET: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office v. Booking.com B.V.

Generic terms cannot be trademarked, but Booking.com wants to trademark its name. This case is about whether generic terms can become protected trademarks by the addition of a generic "".com"" domain.

Tuesday, May 5: Aid for HIV program

10 a.m.. ET: USAID v. Alliance for Open Society International

A new twist on an old case. In 2013, the justices said the government had violated the First Amendment by making funding for U.S. nonprofits contingent on those nonprofits trumpeting the government's policy position on key issues. The case is back, but this time the question before the court is whether it's unconstitutional if the government makes funding contingent for foreign-based affiliates of those same U.S. nonprofits.

Wednesday, May 6: Birth control access & Robocalls

10 a.m. ET: Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania consolidated with Trump v. Pennsylvania

The court considers a Trump administration rule that would allow employers with religious or moral objections to birth control to limit their employees' access to free birth control under the Affordable Care Act.

11 a.m. ET: Barr v. American Association of Political Consultants

In 1991, Congress passed a law that prohibits most robocalls. In 2015, Congress created an exception for government debt collection. Political groups, which want to use robocalls to raise money and turn out voters, are challenging the act as a violation of their First Amendment free speech rights.

Monday, May 11: Native American land & Religious freedom

10 a.m. ET: McGirt v. Oklahoma

On the surface, this case is about whether states, like Oklahoma, can prosecute members of Native American tribes for crimes committed in the historical bounds of tribal land. But it has implications for state power over thousands of miles of land in Oklahoma that has historically belonged to Creek, Cherokee, Seminole, Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes.

11 a.m. ET: Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru consolidated with St. James School v. Biel

A freedom of religion case that tests whether lay teachers at parochial schools are protected by federal laws barring discrimination based on race, gender, age and disability; or whether, as the schools here maintain, their lay teachers are exempt from the protection of those laws. The case has potential implications for the millions of Americans employed not just by parochial schools but also by religiously affiliated hospitals, charities and universities.

Tuesday, May 12: Trump finances

10 a.m. ET: Trump v. Mazars consolidated with Trump v. Deutsche Bank AG; Trump v. Vance

These cases involve subpoenas for some of Trump's pre-presidential financial records. Two consolidated cases — Trump v. Mazars and Trump v. Deutsche Bank — ask whether Congress has the power to subpoena the president's personal records except during an impeachment proceeding; Trump v. Vance addresses a New York grand jury subpoena for those same records in the course of a criminal investigation.

Wednesday, May 13: Faithless electors

10 a.m. ET: Chiafalo v. Washington; Colorado Department of State v. Baca

Both cases involve so-called faithless electors — Electoral College delegates who fail to vote for the presidential candidate they were pledged to support. At issue is whether states can punish or remove such electors in order to ensure that the state's electors accurately represent the state's vote.",npr,https://www.npr.org/2020/05/03/848317039/listen-live-supreme-court-arguments-begin-monday
['Jeff Conroy-Krutz'],2020-05-03,Opinion: Why Is Support For Media Crackdowns Rising In Africa?,"Opinion: Why Is Support For Media Crackdowns Rising In Africa?

Jeff Conroy-Krutz is associate professor of political science at Michigan State University. He studies African media, focusing on how media affect electoral competition, ethnic and partisan polarization, and political engagement. He has conducted research in Central, East and West Africa and is editor of the Afrobarometer Working Papers Series.

Leaders around the world are exploiting the fear and uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic to cement their power and suppress their opponents. In Africa, media freedom is particularly under threat, as governments use emergency decrees and disinformation laws to silence critics. Journalists in Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have been jailed or beaten for reporting on the virus. This is not anything new; African strongmen have long tried to curb media freedom. What is perhaps more concerning is the growing evidence that a majority in some African countries now supports their governments' attempts to suppress media freedom.

Findings from the latest surveys conducted between 2016 and 2018 by Afrobarometer, an independent African research network that tracks African citizens' attitudes on political, economic and social issues, suggest that support for media freedom is in sharp decline across the continent. The 2016-18 survey round is the first in which more Africans backed the concept of government restrictions than endorsed media freedoms.

It isn't a negligible change in people's attitudes. Across the same 31 countries that had been surveyed in 2011-13, support for media freedoms dropped 10 points, to 46%, while support for restrictions had grown 10 points, to 49%. Majorities in 18 of the 34 countries surveyed (Africa has 54 countries in total) said that they supported the right of government to limit media freedom. In three countries — Liberia, Mali and Senegal — more than two-thirds of respondents took this position. As recently as the 2011-13 survey round, majorities said this in only four of the African countries surveyed.

Several factors make these declines especially worrisome. For starters, some of the deepest have come in countries, including Tanzania and Uganda, that have enacted the gravest media restrictions. Even more alarming, in many countries support for media freedom, at least as measured here, is now the minority position. In 2011-13, majorities supported media freedom over government control in 24 of 31 African countries surveyed. By 2016-18, that number had shrunk to 15. In Senegal, Mali, Liberia and Gambia, more than two-thirds of respondents backed government-imposed limits on the press.

Nor is this opinion held by a thin slice of these populations. Women (50%), the young (49% of those aged 18 to 25) and urbanites (48%) are roughly as likely to support press limits as men (48%), seniors (49% among those over 65) and rural residents (50%). Support for curbing media freedom is increasingly deep and wide.

Why is Africans' support for media freedom declining? Are those who support their governments simply following their leaders' self-serving rhetoric? Or are Africans responding to perceived problems with media content, such as hyperpartisanship or disinformation?

In the most recent Afrobarometer survey, 43% of those who say that they trust their country's leader ""just a little"" or ""not at all"" still back government restrictions on media. The implication of this striking finding is clear: even many Africans who do not support their current governments still favor media curbs. This suggests that many Africans are withdrawing support for media freedom not because they are taking cues from the political class, but because they independently hold an unfavorable view of what the media produce. It is hard to fault citizens for this negative assessment of media content.

One problem is bias. In the thin advertising markets common in Africa, media enterprises often require paid government announcements and other forms of political patronage. Others are often owned outright by politicians and their allies. Many Africans have come to see journalists and media outlets as beholden to political figures and parties rather than a source of trusted information or a check on corruption. In their most extreme form, biased media and more fringe outlets can cross the line into hate speech and incitement to violence, which is particularly worrisome given the fragility of many of the region's political systems. The problem of disinformation also looms especially large in Africa. In Nigeria's 2019 elections, one WhatsApp rumor falsely claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari, who had sought medical care abroad during his first term, had died and was replaced by a Sudanese clone. Real problems with bias, hate speech and disinformation make it all the easier for governments to rationalize suppressing free speech.

What, then, is to be done? Social media companies need to do more to limit the spread of inflammatory, hateful and misleading content on their platforms. We know this is possible. WhatsApp has already made moves to limit the spread of disinformation around the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, foreign governments and international organizations, including major donors, must make media freedom a priority when dealing with African states. Governments that jail journalists, cut off the Internet and shutter media houses must be named and shamed.

African content producers must shoulder a measure of responsibility, too. Forward-thinking publishers and broadcasters are participating in efforts, such as the African Media Initiative, to promote professionalism and social responsibility in journalism. The status quo gives self-interested politicians too many opportunities to make sweeping attacks that are unfair to the thousands of journalists, broadcasters and bloggers who, despite slender resources and threats to their personal safety, bring fair, accurate and in-depth reporting to people throughout Africa.
