County now requires residents to wear face coverings. Here are the details,"Los Angeles County’s new requirement on wearing face coverings went into effect Wednesday night. Here’s a look at how that new law works, as well as similar orders around California.



How does L.A. County’s face-covering order work?

Customers of essential businesses are required to wear a face covering while inside.

Also, employers of essential businesses must give all employees whose duties require contact with other people a cloth face covering to wear while working with other people.

The L.A. County order, effective for all 10 million people who live in Los Angeles County, does not require mask-wearing while in the backyard or while on a solitary run or walk.

Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said wearing face coverings protects other people from your germs in case you’re infected and don’t realize it.

She suggested wearing the face covering while you’re in places with other people, such as on a bus or a train while making an essential trip.

“If you’re all by yourself ... you can put it on if you want to, but you’re not required to,” Ferrer said.

People who live together also are not required to wear masks while on a walk or a jog, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said.

The cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments, issued similar orders to be consistent with L.A. County’s order. A similar order for the city of Los Angeles, with a population of 4 million people, went into effect Friday.

Have some cities issued even stronger face-covering rules?

Beverly Hills and Glendale require face coverings whenever people leave home, including for walks through the neighborhood.

Under the order, drivers traveling alone or with members of their households do not need to wear face coverings unless they lower their vehicle’s windows for any reason, including to interact with first responders, food service workers or others who are not members of their household.

What about other counties in Southern California?

San Diego County requires employees who may have contact with the public to wear a cloth face covering, such as in grocery stores, pharmacies, convenience stores, gas stations and banks, as well as on public transit and for childcare providers while serving food.

Orange County is strongly encouraging residents to wear face coverings when leaving home, as well as employees at essential businesses while working. The city of Costa Mesa, however, is generally making face coverings mandatory when residents or visitors are outside their home or personal vehicle while performing or accessing an essential service.

Riverside County requires everyone to wear a face covering when leaving home.

San Bernardino County requires everyone to wear a face covering when outside the home for essential activities.

Ventura County is urging residents to wear a face covering if they will be around others.

What about the San Francisco Bay Area?

A number of San Francisco Bay Area counties, including San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo and Marin, are requiring face coverings for people when they are outside their homes to access essential businesses such as grocery stores or pharmacies, while seeking healthcare services and while waiting for and riding public transit. Masks aren’t required for children 12 or younger. They also aren’t required while at home, in cars alone or with members of the same household or while walking, hiking, cycling or running outdoors, although people are asked to have one readily accessible.

Sonoma County is requiring people to wear face coverings before entering any indoor facility outside their home, such as grocery stores, dry cleaners, offices and post offices; in any enclosed open space, like construction sites; in taxis, ride-hail vehicles and buses; and in outdoor areas when people are unable to keep six feet away from others at all times, such as farmers markets, gas stations and drive-thrus.

Santa Clara County is urging people to wear face masks in public.

What do state and federal authorities say?

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings such as grocery stores and pharmacies, where it can be hard to keep six feet away from other people.

The California Department of Public Health says wearing face coverings may reduce asymptomatic transmission of the virus and reinforce physical distancing.

“There is limited evidence to suggest that use of cloth face coverings by the public during a pandemic could help reduce disease transmission,” the agency said. “Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs or sneezes, including someone who has COVID-19 but feels well.

“Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing and washing hands and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these primary interventions,” the agency said.

What kinds of face coverings are acceptable?

Bandannas, fabric masks and neck gaiters are permitted. Officials are urging residents to reserve medical-grade masks and N95 respirators for medical professionals and first responders.

High temperatures have rolled through the Southwest unusually early this year, scorching Phoenix and Las Vegas and sending droves of quarantine-weary Southern Californians to the beaches.

Even before the outbreak, the hottest parts of the country were struggling to protect their residents from summer weather that, fueled by global warming, has become increasingly dangerous. Now the COVID-19 epidemic has presented them with an added crisis — the possibility of millions of people self-isolating in homes and apartments they can’t keep cool.

This is an especially worrying possibility for the elderly and people in poor neighborhoods, where residents are more likely to live in older, less energy-efficient homes and less likely to have air conditioners.

According to a 2019 study by USC scientists, about a third of households in Greater Los Angeles, and roughly half in neighborhoods near the coast, don’t have air conditioning.

Those who do have air conditioning but are living paycheck to paycheck may be reluctant to use it consistently to avoid high electricity bills.

Rupa Basu, chief of the air and climate epidemiological section for the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, said the virus’ effect could be amplified, in part, because it is killing people at higher rates who are already the most susceptible to extreme heat. For older people and Americans with chronic medical conditions, “it’s like getting hit twice,” she said.

In essence, the people who need to stay home the most are in the greatest danger of dying there during a heat wave.

“The messaging here is really tricky,” said Eric Klinenberg, a professor of sociology at New York University and the author of “Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.” Health officials need to be honest about the dangers of the virus and who is most at risk, he said. But it’s also important for older people and those in poor health to know they shouldn’t sit at home alone all day.

“We have millions of people who are aging alone who feel like they need to stay indoors,” he said. “And social isolation combined with extreme heat is a proven killer.”

Many Americans have been stuck at home, venturing out only to buy groceries or go for a walk, and those efforts at self-quarantining have been vital to slowing the spread of the virus in hot spots such as New York City and New Orleans. Yet that progress has not been uniform. Although some states are beginning to lift restrictions, urged on by President Trump, outbreaks continue to emerge in prisons, meatpacking plants and formerly untouched towns and counties in rural parts of the South and Midwest.

The administration has cautioned that without a cure or vaccine, some form of social distancing will probably remain in place throughout the summer.

With that in mind, cities have closed senior centers, libraries, public pools and gyms — places of refuge on blisteringly hot days — that could also become places of contagion during an epidemic. In California, state and local authorities have clashed over whether to close beaches.

Middle-class Americans can still retreat into their air-conditioned homes and cars, but for low-income residents and seniors on tight budgets, staying home during the summer could be dangerous.

Recent research by USC environmental engineering professor George Ban-Weiss and his team suggests that communities most vulnerable to extreme heat have some of the the lowest rates of air conditioning and the highest rates of poverty. In Compton, Inglewood and Lynwood, only about 40% of households have air conditioning.

None of the 6,500 units owned and managed by the city of Los Angeles’ Housing Authority come with air conditioning, not even in the San Fernando Valley, where summer temperatures can be especially punishing.

Eric Brown, a spokesman for the authority, known as HACLA, said that most of the city’s public housing was built in the 1930s and ‘40s, before air conditioning was considered essential. Residents are allowed to install their own window units if they get the agency’s permission, he said, which it has always given.

The situation is only marginally better in public housing managed by the county, where about half the units — including all of those occupied by elderly residents — have air conditioning.

In Arizona, where air conditioning can be a matter of life and death, public health officials and heat researchers are concerned about the state’s homeless population and people living in mobile homes built decades ago, before modern building codes.

Notoriously difficult and expensive to cool, mobile homes can easily surpass 90 degrees indoors during the summer. Their residents, who tend to be older, are already overrepresented among indoor heat-related deaths.

David Hondula, a climatologist who studies the impact of heat on health at Arizona State University, said that another factor researchers are paying attention to is substance abuse.

People who struggle with sobriety are at greater risk of dying from exposure to extreme heat, he said. A world upended by the coronavirus — in which 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment, anxiety is the norm, and addiction support groups including Alcoholics Anonymous have had to switch to online meetings — could make more people susceptible.

“The stress and worry of coronavirus could lead to increased use of those substances which impair one’s ability to cope with the heat,” Hondula said.

The combination of the virus and the approaching summer season is forcing health officials and emergency managers to rethink long-established protocols for responding to extreme heat. For the last month, public officials across Arizona have joined a weekly hourlong conference call to discuss strategies for providing shelter and distributing water without inadvertently spreading the coronavirus among the people they’re trying to serve.

When the first heat wave of the year arrived in the Southwest last week, enveloping the region in record heat for April, officials in Arizona and Nevada scrambled to open cooling centers for people who don’t have air conditioning at home.

In Maricopa County, Ariz., which spent five days under an excessive heat warning, the coronavirus complicated efforts. Many of the public buildings that would normally be converted into shelters had been closed down, their staff self-isolating at home, limiting the number of cooling centers that could be opened to the public and placing more of the burden on charitable organizations and religious groups.

Brande Mead, human services director for the Maricopa Assn. of Governments, a Phoenix-based regional planning group, said that donations of bottled water were also down.

“Water and other supplies can be hard to obtain right now,” Mead said. “In many of the grocery stores, the water aisle is empty.”

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called on cities and states operating cooling centers to maintain at least six feet between people and to screen visitors, including conducting temperature checks, before they enter. “If possible,” the agency’s guidelines state, “provide alternative cooling sites for those showing symptoms of COVID-19.”

The agency also said that states should consider expanding programs that help people pay their utility bills, such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, as a way to lower the number of people using cooling centers.

In the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, about half the states issued orders barring utilities from turning off customers’ power, heat or water if they had overdue bills. In other states, customers are dependent on the generosity of their utilities companies, many of which voluntarily agreed to suspend disconnections.

Advertisement

But whether those suspensions will last through the summer is unclear. And there is considerable disagreement among social service providers and public officials about whether such steps actually benefit customers who’ve fallen behind on their payments.

In 2019, following news that an Arizona woman had died after her power was shut off for non-payment, the Arizona Corporation Commission — which oversees public utilities — placed a moratorium on summertime power disconnections. When the suspension ended in mid-October, some customers were left with staggeringly high electric bills.

It’s too early to say whether the suspension saved lives. Official heat-related death statistics for 2019 have not been released yet, but Hondula said the preliminary data show there was not a dramatic reduction. In Maricopa County, 196 peopled are thought to have died from heat exposure last summer, up from 182 the year before.

“Having one’s power cut is not the only part of the story,” Hondula said.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-05-05/coronavirus-could-worsen-death-toll-of-summer-heat-waves-health-officials-warn

Is it a turning point?,"California recorded its first week-over-week decline in reported coronavirus deaths, a promising if preliminary sign of progress as Gov. Gavin Newsom prepared to reopen some businesses this week.

Two weeks ago, California reported its highest one-week death toll — 542 fatalities among people infected with the coronavirus between April 20 and April 26. Last week, the weekly death toll fell for the first time, dropping nearly 9% to 495 fatalities for the seven-day period that ended Sunday, according to a Times data analysis.

While it was an improvement, last week’s toll was still the third highest over the course of the pandemic.

Even hard-hit parts of the state saw some relief. Los Angeles County, home to 55% of California’s COVID-19 deaths despite having only one-quarter of the state’s population, saw its reported weekly death toll flatten for the first time: 315 deaths each week for the last two weeks.

The San Francisco Bay Area reported 49 deaths last week, a decrease from the 61 fatalities reported the previous week; San Diego County reported 28 deaths last week, a drop from the 40 reported the previous week. The San Joaquin Valley reported 22 deaths last week, a decline from the 25 reported the previous week, and the Sacramento area reported four deaths last week, down from 12 the previous week. The Central Coast reported three deaths last week, the same as the previous week.

Nationally, nearly 13,000 deaths were reported last week, compared with nearly 14,000 the previous week.

But California still has not seen the sustained 14-day decline in coronavirus cases the White House has suggested as a key criteria before easing stay-at-home orders. The state reported its highest weekly coronavirus case total during April 20-26, with 12,122 cases. Last week, 9,967 cases were reported, an 18% decline, but last week’s case count was still the second-highest weekly total reported during the pandemic.

Statewide, the number of hospitalizations remains steady and flat, with perhaps some initial signs of decreasing, the state health officer, Dr. Sonia Angell, said Monday. The statewide average daily number of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 was 4,822 last week, down nearly 2% from 4,905 the previous week.

Hospitalizations have been flat in the five Southern California counties closest to Los Angeles, as well as the San Joaquin Valley and San Diego County. But hospitalizations are noticeably trending downward in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Sacramento region, the Central Coast and the Shasta Cascade region, made up of the eight counties in northeastern California.

California, which has recorded more than 2,200 fatalities, has seen far fewer deaths compared to hot spots such as New York and New Jersey, which have respectively logged deaths of more than 24,000 and more than 7,000. Experts credit early social distancing rules for part of that trend. Newsom announced Monday that some retail stores across the state can reopen for curbside pickup as early as Friday.

The new changes are part of a four-stage plan the governor laid out last week to gradually transition back to normal in a state of nearly 40 million people whose lives have been upended by the COVID-19 health crisis.

But Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that different cities will need to take different steps to emerge from the pandemic-induced shutdown and that city and county officials are still trying to determine the safest course.

Only time will tell whether the weekly drop is a momentary blip or marks the beginning of a sustained decline in cases. Experts have warned about a rise in cases and deaths as governments ease stay-at-home orders, and there continues to be worry about a second wave of deadly cases later in the year.

And COVID-19 continues to be a severe threat, having become the leading cause of death in L.A. County, surpassing the previous top killer, coronary heart disease.

“Ninety-five percent of us have still not been infected. And until there’s a vaccine, most residents in L.A. County can be infected at any time over the months to come,” Los Angeles County’s director of public health, Barbara Ferrer, said last week. “Without taking extraordinary measures to reduce our exposures to people who are infected, and to keep our distance as much as possible, we could easily see a big spike in new cases.”

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that it’s hard to predict whether the pandemic will become increasingly quiet after June, or if large outbreaks could occur as states ease stay-at-home orders. Currently, the national death toll is more than 68,000, according to Johns Hopkins University, having killed more Americans than the Vietnam War.

“When you look out to the end of June, it’s probably the case that we’re going to get above 100,000 deaths nationally,” Gottlieb said on the CBS program. “But what happens when we come back in the fall and schools are back in session? ... Then you can see this slow simmer explode into a new epidemic or large outbreaks. That’s the concern, that if we don’t snuff this out more, and you have this slow burn of infection, it can ignite at any time.”

Gavin Newsom on Tuesday criticized two rural Northern California counties that are allowing businesses and restaurants to reopen, saying their decision to defy his statewide stay-at-home order has put their communities at increased risk for a new coronavirus outbreak.

Sutter and Yuba counties, both north of Sacramento, allowed businesses to reopen on Monday after a similar decision was made in Modoc County in California’s northeastern corner. Officials in the three counties argued that they were less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than hot spots such as Los Angeles and the Bay Area and said the shutdown was hurting their local economies.

“They’re making a big mistake. They’re putting their public at risk. They’re putting our progress at risk,” Newsom said during a COVID-19 briefing in Sacramento on Tuesday. “These are real exceptions. The overwhelming majority of Californians are playing by the rules doing the right thing.”

But Newsom did not say if the state would take any action to enforce the stay-at-home order and other statewide restrictions in those counties.

Instead, the Democratic governor encouraged officials there to abide by his more measured plan for reopening, which was announced Monday and will allow some retail stores across the state to reopen as early as Friday if certain safeguards are put in place.

Under the new statewide COVID-19 guidelines, the governor said bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, sporting goods retailers and others can reopen for pickup, and manufacturing and logistics can resume in the retail supply chain. Newsom said more detailed guidelines on the businesses that can resume limited operations would be released later this week.

Shopping malls, gyms, bars, barbershops, salons and similar establishments must remain closed under Newsom’s order, and in-restaurant dining remains prohibited.

Newsom said some of the restrictions would be eased if county health officials, in concurrence with their county board of supervisors, can verify that they have adequate healthcare facilities and personal protective equipment to care for COVID-19 patients, and the capability to test, isolate and track those who have the virus. Newsom said that if a county has a low number of COVID-19 cases, that will be considered when the state issues variances.

In spite of those requirements, however, Dr. Ngoc-Phuong Luu, health officer for Yuba and Sutter counties, issued new orders on Friday that allow restaurants, retailers, shopping malls, gyms, fitness studios, salons, spas and tattoo parlors to operate.

“They put those businesses at risk, not only the health of their communities at risk. I would encourage them just to do the right thing and know that we are committed to working with them as we have been,” Newsom said. “We have a process and protocol to do that. And so we believe in ready-aim-fire — not, ready-fire-aim”

The governor’s comments came during a visit Tuesday to Display California, a small business in Sacramento, to highlight his plan to ease restrictions.

Newsom also faced defiance in Southern California after he ordered the closure of all Orange County beaches last week. The governor took that action after thousands of beachgoers flocked to the the coast during the recent heatwave, ignoring Newsom’s pleas to stay at home and maintain a safe distance from others.

On Tuesday, the state announced that three Orange County beach cities — Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and Dana Point — will be permitted to reopen their stretches of coastline this week with certain limitations, including taking steps to avoid overcrowding and allow safe physical distancing.

The move came a day after similar plans for Laguna Beach and San Clemente were approved by the state, and several days after the Huntington Beach City Council voted to take legal action to block Newsom’s beach closure.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/newsom-reopening-of-yuba-and-sutter-counties-coronavirus

Gavin Newsom ordered the closure of all Orange County beaches to stem the spread of the coronavirus, state officials have announced that three beach cities will be permitted to reopen their stretches of coastline this week with certain limitations.

Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Seal Beach submitted plans to Sacramento that would allow the public to immediately access the coastline for active recreation only. The plans, approved Tuesday, include a range of measures to avoid overcrowding and allow safe physical distancing, according to the California Natural Resources Agency.

Under Huntington Beach’s plan, people are now permitted to use the beach from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. with the stipulation that they remain active. Sunbathing is not allowed. Parking meters along Pacific Coast Highway and the beach’s bike path are available for use, but the pier and the city’s beach parking lot will remain closed.

“We’re delighted to be reopening our beaches for active recreation, which will allow our community to once again enjoy the recreational and mental health benefits from spending time in the Pacific Ocean,” Mayor Lyn Semeta said in a prepared statement. “The new active recreation rules that we’re instituting will allow for continued beach access in a manner that emphasizes the need to practice safe social distancing.”

Seal Beach’s coastline will be open — beginning Monday — for limited hours Monday through Thursday with the requirement that visitors remain active while on the sand.

Officials in Dana Point said their beaches will also only be open to walking, running and recreational uses like swimming and surfing. No gatherings will be permitted, but the public can still access the city’s tide pools.

Dana Point City Manager Mike Killebrew said in a statement that he hopes “everyone understands how important it is that we all follow new guidelines that will promote socially responsible recreation and enjoyment by the public.”

“We know how important our beaches are to the residents of Dana Point. And we know how much residents value, especially now, access to our beautiful coastline,” he said.

State-operated beaches within the Huntington Beach and Dana Point city limits also reopened with the same active-recreation protocols, city officials said.

The move came a day after similar plans for Laguna Beach and San Clemente were approved by the state.

The only coastal city that has not yet gained approval from the state to reopen is Newport Beach. The city, just a few miles south of Huntington Beach, also submitted a plan to Sacramento on Saturday to safely reopen their coastline, said city spokesman John Pope.

“We have been closely coordinating with Huntington Beach about strategies to enhance the management of our beaches,” Pope said. “Despite repeated attempts by city staff to connect with state officials, we have not yet received any information on an approval or modifications, or when a decision might be made.”

Newsom last week ordered a “hard close” of all Orange County beaches. The order came after an April heat wave sent thousands to the sand in some beach communities. Newsom called the images circulating of people congregating on Orange County’s shores “disturbing.”

The closure prompted a legal showdown between cities and the state, as well as outrage from the public . Some argued that the governor was targeting Orange County based on photographs that did not show the full scope of what was happening on the beaches.

Newsom on Tuesday praised local leaders in Orange County beach cities for working with his administration to reach an agreement. Just days ago, city leaders in Huntington Beach and Dana Point voted to take legal action against the governor.

Huntington Beach City Atty. Michael Gates said the city is continuing to move forward with its request for an injunction against the governor’s order despite the beaches being allowed to reopen.

Newsom said his administration has been negotiating with the beach cities since the weekend and said he hoped to make a future announcement about beach access in Orange County soon.

“It’s a spirit of collaboration and cooperation that is necessary as we move forward,” Newsom said during his daily COVID-19 briefing in Sacramento.

On Tuesday, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted to submit a plan to the state that would allow county-operated beaches to reopen for active recreation.

Supervisor Lisa Bartlett, who proposed the item, said it would help put county beaches in line with what was happening in nearby cities and allow people to get out and recreate along the coast.

“We want people to walk and jog and run and enjoy water sports but to keep moving,” she said, “and the state is fully behind that.”

Supervisor Don Wagner opposed the motion, along with Supervisor Michelle Steel, saying any restrictions on beach activity were arbitrary and that it was appalling that the county would bow to rules the governor put in place without input from local officials.

“This is exactly what we shouldn’t be doing as a government,” Wagner said.

Gavin Newsom announcing that some stores could open by the end of the week, Southern California communities are considering what to do next as coronavirus cases continue to increase.

Los Angeles County officials confirmed 58 more COVID-19 deaths Tuesday, bringing the total number of coronavirus-related fatalities in the county to 1,313. Of those who have died, 647 were living in institutional settings — the majority of which were nursing facilities.

Officials reported an additional 1,638 cases — a high number that is largely due to a backlog in data reporting. So far, there have been 27,815 confirmed coronavirus infections in the county.

As communities continue to report more cases and deaths linked to the virus throughout the state, which has seen more than 56,000 confirmed infections and nearly 3,000 related deaths, Newsom announced Monday that some retail stores across the state could reopen with modifications as early as Friday. The news came amid growing pressure to ease the stay-at-home order that has cratered the California economy .

On Tuesday, Newsom said social-distancing practices would remain in place as more people would be put at risk when restrictions were lifted.

“We have to maintain the core construct of our stay-at-home orders,” he said at a news conference.

The economy will start to reopen, but that doesn’t mean people can “go back to normal,” Newsom said. Since COVID-19 is still present, the reopening relies on Californians remaining cautious and following safety protocols.

The virus has affected some parts of California more than others, and some cities’ officials have struggled with when, how — and whether — to begin reopening. Ventura County, for example, has been less affected than has neighboring Los Angeles County, the most populous in the state with 10 million people. L.A. County continues to be a hotbed of the crisis.

Here is a rundown of where Southern California stands right now:

Los Angeles County

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that different cities would need to take different steps to emerge from the pandemic -induced shutdown and that city and county officials were still trying to determine the safest course.

“Our timing on opening may vary from other parts of the state,” he said. “I will reopen our city with careful consideration, guided by public health professionals.”

Garcetti said he did not expect city businesses to be able to offer curbside delivery on Friday in step with Newsom’s outline. L.A.'s Safer at Home order is in effect until May 15 and Garcetti said that he hoped steps restricting commerce could begin to be rolled back by then.

On Tuesday, Garcetti said he supports working in the next few days and weeks on the reopening of “low-risk spaces,” such as trails.

He also announced a new initiative, L.A. Represents, to provide free legal services to residents facing hardships, such as debt and bankruptcy, caused by COVID-19. Volunteer attorneys would represent vulnerable renters and survivors of domestic violence, he said.

“People are finding themselves in some of the most pressing and painful moments of their lives,” Garcetti said. “These are complex situations, and we don’t always all understand the law.”

He said the initiative would also include a support system for small businesses to get back on their feet by helping them renegotiate leases or apply for government loans.

“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy,” he said. “They too often lack effective representation.”

Garcetti also said he is permitting flower wholesalers to open to gear up for Mother’s Day, which he described as one of the industry’s biggest days of the year.

Los Angeles County Public Health director Barbara Ferrer said Monday that officials would be publicly sharing recovery plans this week, noting that “wherever it’s possible to safely reopen, we’ll be doing so as quickly as possible.”

She noted that although social distancing practices had helped slow the spread of COVID-19, the virus remains easily transmissible.

“The virus has not changed,” she said. “More people die in L.A. County every day from COVID-19 than any other disease.”

On Tuesday, she reiterated that fact, adding that as the county plans its first stages of reopening, it must ensure that a spike in cases does not take place.

“We want to make sure we don’t see an increase in our death rate as we are reopening,” she said.

Ferrer previously said the total number of deaths linked to the coronavirus was greater than those who died from influenza over the last eight-month flu season.

Of the 1,201 individuals who have died of COVID-19 where race and ethnicity have been identified, 38% of individuals were Latino, 28% were white, 19% were Asian, 12% were African American, 1% were Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and 1% identified as another race.

Ferrer said African Americans and those who were identified as Native Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander were dying at a much higher rate than all others in L.A. County.

Roughly 93% of all individuals who have died from the virus had underlying health conditions, including lung issues, asthma, heart conditions, immuno-compromised illnesses, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease and liver disease. Ferrer stressed that any individuals with HIV also should take steps to protect themselves.

San Diego County

San Diego city and county leaders unveiled proposed regulations that businesses would have to meet before reopening their doors, as well as a plan to help meet those regulations. The county of roughly 3.4 million has reported more than 4,000 infections and at least 144 deaths linked to the virus.

Although a list detailing which businesses will be allowed to reopen is not yet available, city and county leaders have said there are steps all businesses should be taking as they move toward reopening.

“We can’t do anything about the stay-at-home order — that is clearly up to the governor,” county Supervisor Greg Cox said. “But what we can do is help make it easier for businesses to reopen safely and smartly and smoothly as soon as possible if they have these [guidelines] to work from.”

Advertisement

At Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting, Cox and fellow Supervisor Nathan Fletcher will propose the Reopen San Diego Business Safety Framework , which will require all businesses to develop a Safe Reopening Plan before welcoming customers again.

Such reopening plans are intended to ensure employee and customer safety by increasing sanitation, enforcing physical distancing and encouraging communication with county officials.

A plan unveiled Monday is designed to help businesses meet those county regulations. That plan was developed by the Responsible COVID-19 Economic Reopening Advisory Group and can be used by restaurants, hair and nail salons, and other businesses as they plan to reopen.

“San Diego is ready to recover, and is preparing for a reopening that’s safe, strategic and specific to our diverse industries,” San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said. “These guidelines will help get the economy back on its feet and get San Diegans back to work when state and regional orders are lifted.”

The advisory group’s plan includes five focus areas:

Employee health: Procure and provide personal protective equipment for employees, and commit to voluntary compliance with public health officials on contact tracing and testing.

Safe work site entry: Establish controlled entrance and exit practices to avoid queuing issues and work with the Public Health Department to create processes for checking employees’ symptoms.

Workplace distancing and conditions: Evaluate occupancy and capacity to ensure proper physical distancing and keep shifts consistent with the same employees in each rotation or shift.

Employee training and compliance: Ensure signage on safety requirements, such as hand-washing, physical distancing and reporting procedures for employees who become ill.

Enhanced cleaning and sanitation: Develop a sanitation plan that includes frequent cleaning of restrooms, workstations and public spaces.

The economic advisory group also plans to provide enhanced guidance specific to industries such as restaurants, spas and construction. Those plans are still in development.

Riverside County

The Riverside County Board of Supervisors is also considering ending local public health orders amid a growing push to begin reopening. The county of roughly 2.5 million has reported more than 4,300 infections — the second highest in the state — and 181 deaths linked to the virus.

Supervisors Karen Spiegel and V. Manuel Perez proposed the changes, which include rescinding school closures, ending limitations on short-term lodging, removing restrictions on golf course use and eliminating the requirements to wear face coverings and engaging in social distancing.

The Riverside City Council on Monday urged the county to hold off on the plan.

“We know that the coronavirus is still out there and that we need to continue to be vigilant,” said City Councilman Andy Melendrez, according to the Riverside Press-Enterprise.

Last week, the county’s public health officer, Dr. Cameron Kaiser, lifted a few restrictions, including reopening some parks, trails and recreation areas, such as golf courses and tennis courts. However, Kaiser also extended a county health order requiring residents to wear face coverings and practice social distancing through June 19.

Individual counties have the authority to impose health orders that best suit their region, as long as they are not more lax than Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order. Riverside County had previously implemented some of the strictest public health orders in California.

“I want to thank our residents and our county team, whose actions to this unprecedented pandemic have helped us get to this point,” Perez said in a written statement. “Now, we must continue to prepare for our economic recovery and get people back to work.”

Orange County

Orange County officials continue to express concern over Newsom’s decision to close beaches to slow the spread of coronavirus, even as the county continues to report new cases and deaths.

The county of roughly 3.2 million has confirmed nearly 90 infections and 57 deaths, including five reported Monday.

After Huntington Beach and Dana Point filed a lawsuit against the decision, and Newport Beach agreed to file a court brief in support of the endeavor, state officials announced Tuesday that the beach cities would be permitted to reopen their stretches of coastline this week with certain limitations.

The announcement came one day after officials said Laguna Beach and San Clemente would be allowed to open their shores this week, with similar limitations in place.

Both cities previously submitted plans to the state that would allow active recreation along their coastlines while maintaining measures to avoid overcrowding and allow for appropriate physical distancing.

“We appreciate the governor’s willingness to work with us to provide a responsible, gradual approach to reopening all beaches in Laguna Beach for active recreation,” Mayor Bob Whalen said in a statement Monday. “This will allow people the opportunity to walk, jog, swim and surf and get some fresh air and exercise on a limited basis, but not congregate or gather in large groups.”

Wagner, however, characterized the idea of an active plan as “half-steps that satisfy, I guess, the governor’s need to feel like he’s won something.”

“The science is entirely in favor of the position the county took before the governor’s ill-advised order,” he said.

Orange County Executive Officer Frank Kim said Monday that the decision of whether the county itself should submit such a plan rested with the Board of Supervisors, which is expected to discuss the matter Tuesday.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/california-communities-debate-how-quickly-to-lift-stay-at-home-rules-reopen-economy

The whistleblower complaint by Rick Bright, who was abruptly reassigned from his post overseeing drug and vaccine development at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, also says administration officials pressured him to back widespread use of anti-malaria drugs touted by President Trump as a treatment for the virus, even after Bright warned about possible health dangers.

The allegations shed new light on the Trump administration’s disorganized and tardy response to the public health crisis, which has claimed more than 70,000 lives in the U.S. despite assurances by Trump and other senior officials earlier this year that the virus represented little threat to Americans.

Bright, who has a PhD in immunology, was involved in multiple meetings and discussions with senior White House and health officials in the first months of 2020, giving him a front-row seat to the administration response, including Trump’s promotion of the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.

“I was pressured to let politics and cronyism drive decisions over the recommendations of the best scientists we have,” Bright said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. “Their eagerness to push blindly forward without scientific data to put this drug into the hands of Americans was alarming to me.”

Bright was abruptly removed in April as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a research agency within the Health and Human Services Department that, among other duties, was overseeing research on coronavirus vaccines.

He contends that his reassignment to a lesser job at the National Institutes of Health was in retaliation for his repeated clashes with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Robert Kadlec, an Azar deputy with responsibility for overseeing public health preparedness. Kadlec, the assistant secretary for planning and readiness, oversaw Bright’s office.

Bright’s ouster was “retaliation, plain and simple,” said Debra S. Katz, one of his lawyers. “They sidelined him and excluded him and ignored his very detailed advice.”

His claims are detailed in a complaint seeking reinstatement to his post that was filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which oversees the protection of whistleblowers.

“HHS political leadership leveled baseless criticisms against [Bright] for his proactive efforts to invest early in vaccine development as well as in critical supplies such as masks, respirators, and swabs, which were in short supply and would be necessary to combat COVID-19,” the complaint says.

In response to questions, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley did not directly address Bright’s allegations, saying in a statement Tuesday: “Dr. Bright was transferred to NIH to work on diagnostics testing — critical to combatting COVID-19 — where he has been entrusted to spend upwards of $1 billion to advance that effort. We are deeply disappointed that he has not shown up to work on behalf of the American people and lead on this critical endeavor.”

In addition to their sharp disagreements over coronavirus, Bright alleges in the complaint that he opposed moves by Kadlec to award contracts worth tens of millions of dollars to several small pharmaceutical companies represented by a friend of Kadlec’s who was working as industry consultant.

In November, he opposed a $100-million proposal to fund an Ebola treatment developed “by a longtime friend of Dr. Kadlec” at Emory University in Atlanta and marketed by a small Miami-based firm called Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, according to the complaint. Last month, the consortium again sought Health and Human Services funding, claiming the drug showed promise against coronavirus, even though no human trials had been conducted, the complaint says.

Ridgeback and Emory did not return calls seeking comment.

The 89-page complaint documents repeated efforts by Bright in the first weeks of 2020 to urge Azar, Kadlec and other administration officials to quickly mobilize to secure masks and other protective equipment for the U.S. medical system to prepare for an outbreak of the virus here.

Widespread shortages of protective equipment for medical workers and testing supplies have persisted throughout the coronavirus outbreak, hampering the U.S. medical response and complicating current efforts to end stay-at-home orders across the country.

As early as Jan. 18, just days after coronavirus cases began to be recorded outside China, Bright pushed Kadlec to begin convening special disaster-planning meetings to coordinate a response across the federal government, according to the complaint.

Kadlec wrote back in an email cited in the complaint that he was “not sure if that is a time sensitive urgency.”

When Bright relayed warnings from mask manufacturers that they were having trouble getting through to U.S. government officials about the need to make production plans, he was similarly rebuffed, he said.

Even as senior health officials finally began to acknowledge the supply issues, Kadlec and others assured the White House in a Feb. 14 briefing that there were no immediate supply-chain issues, Bright’s complaint alleges.

Bright also notes that his skepticism about the anti-malaria drugs touted by Trump antagonized senior administration officials.

“In an apparent effort to score a short-term political victory for the Administration during the escalating health crisis,” Kadlec’s office “pressured BARDA to promote the malaria drug chloroquine,” the complaint says.

Bright said he was ordered on March 23 by Health and Human Services general counsel Bob Charrow, in a directive from the White House, “to drop everything and make the chloroquine donated by Bayer widely available to the American public.”

Bayer had donated chloroquine to the government for for use in treating coronavirus. The company got the drug from factories in India and Pakistan, and it was brought into the U.S. without inspection by the Food and Drug Administration, which concerned Bright, the complaint says.

On March 29, at Bright’s urging, the FDA issued an authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, limiting its use by licensed healthcare providers to treat certain patients who could not otherwise participate in a randomized, controlled trial.

After Trump again touted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 during a White House news conference on April 4, Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir instructed Kadlec and other federal officials to mobilize the nation’s supply chain to “flood NY and NJ with treatment courses [of hydroxychloroquine],” according to an email included in the complaint.

“Bright felt powerless to protect the public from this potentially toxic chemical that HHS, at President Trump’s insistence, was touting as a safe treatment,” the complaint notes.

"['Ralph Vartabedian', 'A Former National Correspondent At The Los Angeles Times', 'Joined The Newspaper In']",2020-05-05  ,Scientists say a now-dominant strain of the coronavirus appears to be more contagious than original,"Scientists have identified a new strain of the coronavirus that has become dominant worldwide and appears to be more contagious than the versions that spread in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new study led by scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The new strain appeared in February in Europe, migrated quickly to the East Coast of the United States and has been the dominant strain across the world since mid-March, the scientists wrote.

In addition to spreading faster, it may make people vulnerable to a second infection after a first bout with the disease, the report warned.

The 33-page report was posted Thursday on BioRxiv, a website that researchers use to share their work before it is peer reviewed, an effort to speed up collaborations with scientists working on COVID-19 vaccines or treatments. That research has been largely based on the genetic sequence of earlier strains and might not be effective against the new one.

The mutation identified in the new report affects the now infamous spikes on the exterior of the coronavirus, which allow it to enter human respiratory cells. The report’s authors said they felt an “urgent need for an early warning” so that vaccines and drugs under development around the world will be effective against the mutated strain.

Wherever the new strain appeared, it quickly infected far more people than the earlier strains that came out of Wuhan, China, and within weeks it was the only strain that was prevalent in some nations, according to the report. The new strain’s dominance over its predecessors demonstrates that it is more infectious, according to the report, though exactly why is not yet known.

The coronavirus, known to scientists as SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 3.5 million people around the world and caused more than 250,000 COVID-19 deaths since its discovery late last year.

The report was based on a computational analysis of more than 6,000 coronavirus sequences from around the world, collected by the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data, a public-private organization in Germany. Time and again, the analysis found the new version was transitioning to become dominant.

The Los Alamos team, assisted by scientists at Duke University and the University of Sheffield in England, identified 14 mutations. Those mutations occurred among the nearly 30,000 base pairs of RNA that other scientists say make up the coronavirus’s genome. The report authors focused on a mutation called D614G, which is responsible for the change in the virus’ spikes.

“The story is worrying, as we see a mutated form of the virus very rapidly emerging, and over the month of March becoming the dominant pandemic form,” study leader Bette Korber, a computational biologist at Los Alamos, wrote on her Facebook page. “When viruses with this mutation enter a population, they rapidly begin to take over the local epidemic, thus they are more transmissible.”

While the Los Alamos report is highly technical and dispassionate, Korber expressed some deep personal feelings about the implications of the finding in her Facebook post.

“This is hard news,” wrote Korber, “but please don’t only be disheartened by it. Our team at LANL was able to document this mutation and its impact on transmission only because of a massive global effort of clinical people and experimental groups, who make new sequences of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) in their local communities available as quickly as they possibly can.”

Bette Korber, a computational biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, leads a team examining mutations of the novel coronavirus. (Los Alamos National Laboratory)

Korber, a graduate of Cal State Long Beach who went on to earn a PhD in chemistry at Caltech, joined the lab in 1990 and focused much of her work on an HIV vaccine. In 2004, she won the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the U.S. Department of Energy’s highest recognition for scientific achievement. She contributed a portion of the financial prize to help establish an orphanage for young AIDS victims in South Africa.

The report contains regional breakdowns of when the new strain of virus first emerged and how long it took to become dominant.

Italy was one of the first countries to see the new virus in the last week of February, almost at the same time that the original strain appeared. Washington was among the first states to get hit with the original strain in late February, but by March 15 the mutated strain dominated. New York was hit by the original virus around March 15, but within days the mutant strain took over. The team did not report results for California.

Scientists at major organizations working on a vaccine or drugs have told The Times that they are pinning their hopes on initial evidence that the virus is stable and not likely to mutate the way influenza virus does, requiring a new vaccine every year. The Los Alamos report could upend that assumption.

If the pandemic fails to wane seasonally as the weather warms, the study warns, the virus could undergo further mutations even as research organizations prepare the first medical treatments and vaccines. Without getting on top of the risk now, the effectiveness of vaccines could be limited. Some of the compounds in development are supposed to latch onto the spike or interrupt its action. If they were designed based on the original version of the spike, they might not be effective against the new coronavirus strain, the study’s authors warned.

“We cannot afford to be blindsided as we move vaccines and antibodies into clinical testing,” Korber wrote on Facebook. “Please be encouraged by knowing the global scientific community is on this, and we are cooperating with each other in ways I have never seen … in my 30 years as a scientist.”

David Montefiori, a Duke University scientist who worked on the report said it is the first to document a mutation in the coronavirus that appears to make it more infectious.

Although the researchers don’t yet know the details about how the mutated spike behaves inside the body, it’s clearly doing something that gives it an evolutionary advantage over its predecessor and is fueling its rapid spread. One scientist called it a “classic case of Darwinian evolution.”

“D614G is increasing in frequency at an alarming rate, indicating a fitness advantage relative to the original Wuhan strain that enables more rapid spread,” the study said.

Still unknown is whether this mutant virus could account for regional variations in how hard COVID-19 is hitting different parts of the world.

In the United States, doctors had begun to independently question whether new strains of the virus could account for the differences in how it has infected, sickened and killed people, said Alan Wu, a UC San Francisco professor who runs the clinical chemistry and toxicology laboratories at San Francisco General Hospital.

Medical experts have speculated in recent weeks that they were seeing at least two strains of the virus in the U.S., one prevalent on the East Coast and another on the West Coast, according to Wu.

“We are looking to identify the mutation,” he said, noting that his hospital has had only a few deaths out of the hundreds of cases it has treated, which is “quite a different story than we are hearing from New York.”

The Los Alamos study does not indicate that the new version of the virus is more lethal than the original. People infected with the mutated strain appear to have higher viral loads. But the study’s authors from the University of Sheffield found that among a local sample of 447 patients, hospitalization rates were about the same for people infected with either virus version.

Even if the new strain is no more dangerous than the others, it could still complicate efforts to bring the pandemic under control. That would be an issue if the mutation makes the virus so different from earlier strains that people who have immunity to them would not be immune to the new version.

If that is indeed the case, it could make “individuals susceptible to a second infection,” the study authors wrote.

It’s possible that the mutation changes the spike in some way that helps the virus evade the immune system, said Montefiori, who has worked on an HIV vaccine for 30 years. “It is hypothetical.

He Previously Wrote For The Paper S National Desk.']",2020-05-05  ,White House may close its coronavirus task force this month,"Although the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, the White House plans to wind down the task force that is guiding the federal government’s response and hand off responsibility to individual agencies, a move aimed at distancing President Trump from potentially unpopular public health decisions as he shifts his focus to the economy and his reelection.

Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that the high-profile task force, which has issued social distancing guidelines and directly advised the president since January, could wrap up in the coming weeks and shift its work to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other agencies.

“I think we’re starting to look at the Memorial Day window, early June window as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies begin to manage — begin to manage our national response in a more traditional manner,” Pence told reporters.

The task force has met less often in recent days as Trump, following a sharp decline in his approval ratings, has stopped holding nightly televised briefings with Pence, public health officials and other members of the group tasked with charting the administration’s course in the coronavirus crisis.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a crucial member of the task force, appeared caught off guard by the decision, initially denying reports only to have Pence confirm them a short time later.

Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, who heads the White House response team, have sometimes gently corrected Trump’s misguided medical advice, including his dangerous suggestion that injecting household disinfectant could cure COVID-19, and they dissuaded him from lifting stay-at-home guidelines by Easter. Polls show they are far more trusted than the president.

Trump left the Washington area Tuesday for the first time since March to visit a factory in Phoenix that produces protective masks. He donned goggles for the factory tour but did not wear a mask during his visit to a state that this week reported its deadliest day of the pandemic, with 33 deaths on Monday.

Asked about plans to close the White House task force, Trump promised “something in a different form” but suggested its work was complete. He appeared impatient to move on to an economic message, saying the country “is now in the next phase of our battle.”

“We did what was right and now we’re reopening our country,” he said.

The plan to dismantle the group drew immediate concern from some public health officials, who argue that the lack of clear central authority has hindered the nation’s response to a disease that already has killed over 71,000 Americans.

“The concept that we might declare victory prematurely is dangerous from a public health perspective,” said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Johns Hopkins training program in HIV epidemiology and prevention science.

“Too-early lifting of restrictions where community transmission is still underway could lead to an overall prolonging of the U.S. epidemic and to the loss of more American lives — and jobs,” he said.

Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the overseas Ebola response for the Obama administration, noted that infections are rising outside New York, while testing and equipment needs remain unfulfilled. The biggest growth in cases is among those unable to maintain distance — in prisons and at long-term care facilities and high-risk job sites.

Konyndyk likened the White House eagerness to portray an end of the crisis to President George W. Bush’s infamous aircraft carrier appearance beneath a “Mission Accomplished” banner in May 2003, when the war in Iraq was years from completion, a blunder that haunted his presidency.

“Mission abandoned is more like it,” Konyndyk said of the Trump administration. “I’m dumbfounded there’s progress they could cite that would justify anything other than doubling down. The fire is still burning where it’s still finding oxygen and we’re about to give it a bunch more oxygen.”

Robert Hecht, who teaches global health policy and epidemiology at Yale University, said a task force tied to the White House should be kept in place to convey presidential leadership in a “grave crisis.” Disbanding it weakens the ability of Fauci, Birx and other public health officials to align their judgments with economic decisions, he said.

“Perhaps this is why the president and [vice president] want to disband it — to lower the profile and influence of the honest and cautionary messages of Fauci and Birx, so Trump can inject his ‘Happy Time Tunes’ without any dissenting voices,” he said.

Trump has sought in recent weeks to shift responsibility to governors and mayors to begin lifting the lockdown orders that have ground the American economy to a halt and undermined his reelection bid.

With Trump increasingly urging states to reopen, governors and mayors have begun to issue a conflicting patchwork of guidelines, with some states locked down for weeks ahead and others starting to open beaches, businesses and parks.

The president has given mixed signals, attacking Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, for refusing to ease her state’s stay-at-home order, and then blasting Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, after he became the first to lift restrictions.

Trump also has repeatedly signaled that despite data to the contrary, the worst of the pandemic has passed — and that he deserves the credit.

“People are starting to feel good now,” Trump said in an interview Monday with the New York Post in which he also declared, “the one thing that the pandemic has taught us is that I was right.”

Polling paints a different picture. By 63% to 29%, Americans are more concerned about lifting restrictions too quickly than not quickly enough, according to a Monmouth University survey released Tuesday.

It also showed the president’s approval rating dipping to 43%, with 51% disapproving of his job performance. It found that 55% of Americans think Trump has been “largely inconsistent” in his news briefings.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are eager to call Fauci and other members of the task force to testify under oath about the administration’s response. The White House initially said Fauci was too busy to attend a hearing in the Democratic-led House, but Trump offered another reason Tuesday.

“The House is a bunch of Trump haters,” he said.

He added, “They, frankly, want our situation to be unsuccessful, which means death. Which means death. And our situation is going to be very successful.”

Trump said he planned to allow Fauci to testify before a Republican-controlled Senate committee.

The president’s visit to the Honeywell International mask production assembly line in Phoenix had all the hallmarks of a Trump campaign rally. He riffed about his 2016 win in the state, praised a senator running for reelection, and several people, some decked out in Trump 2020 gear, trooped to the stage to offer effusive praise for him.

In a city beaten down by more than 19,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19, De Blasio began his daily briefing by holding the newspaper up to the camera and delivering an attack at the man staring back at him from the page.

“The president of the United States, a former New Yorker who seems to enjoy stabbing his hometown in the back,” De Blasio said. “What kind of human being sees the suffering here and decides that the people of New York City don’t deserve help?

“Well, I’ll tell you something. Every day President Trump resembles more and more Herbert Hoover, the president who ignored the Great Depression, who didn’t care to put America back on its feet. President Trump wasn’t there for us when we needed testing to stop this horrible disease, and now he’s talking about not helping us in our hour of need. He says he’s not inclined to do bailouts, but he gave a $58-billion bailout to the airline industry and gave a $1.5-trillion bailout to big corporations and the wealthy.

“He’s a pure hypocrite.”

Nearly two months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has not yet passed a stimulus plan that sends help to the states for managing their growing debts. The $2.2-trillion stimulus passed in late March sent $150 billion to states but was limited to direct use helping with the public health emergency.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that the state has a $13-billion debt, created in large part by the loss of tax revenue since the novel coronavirus outbreak shut down the economy, an amount that makes an eventual reopening impossible without federal aid.

Other states announced Tuesday that they are facing major financial strife. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said that his state will cut $775 million from its budget the next two months. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said his state projects a $2.4-billion deficit because of the virus’ impact.

“There is a long winter ahead. COVID-19 is upending life as we know it — and our economy will not be spared,” Walz tweeted.

In Trump’s interview with the Post, he addressed the question of whether to offer support to states along political lines.

“It’s not fair to the Republicans because all the states that need help — they’re run by Democrats in every case,” Trump said. “Florida is doing phenomenal, Texas is doing phenomenal, the Midwest is, you know, fantastic — very little debt. … I don’t think the Republicans want to be in a position where they bail out states that are, that have been mismanaged over a long period of time.”

Advertisement

To that idea, De Blasio responded: “The president is playing politics while people are suffering. He says it right out loud there. Who cares who runs the states? The people need help! Because they live in a state or city run by a Democrat, does that make them less American in your view, Mr. President? It’s absolutely unacceptable. We’ve never seen anything like it in the entire history of this republic.

“All we’re asking to do is get back on our feet so we can contribute to this national recovery. There’s not going to be a national recovery without New York City.”

Cuomo, who has been bringing up this topic for weeks, used a more measured approach Tuesday during his briefing. He said that New York state had added $116 billion to federal coffers since 2015 and that many Democratic-governed states have given far more to the federal government than they take out. New York and other Democratic-run states with high COVID-19 case numbers such as California and Illinois weren’t seeking federal help until the pandemic, he said. In New York state, the disease has killed more than 25,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Cuomo said the “mismanagement” rested with America’s partisan Congress.

“The virus doesn’t pick Democrats or Republicans. It doesn’t kill Democrats and Republicans. It kills Americans,” Cuomo said. “... If we can’t get past this now, when can we ever get past it?”

Cuomo did not attack Trump as directly as De Blasio did, saying he believed the president was simply adopting talking points from other influential Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

But Cuomo did issue a challenge to the White House: The next federal stimulus package must include help for state and local governments — or Trump will have cemented an unfavorable place in history.

“The president is looking at a scenario where either he is responsible and bridges the gap or they will not pass any legislation and then he will have failed, and this nation will suffer,” Cuomo said.

This back-and-forth between Trump and the New York leaders comes a day after the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington raised its projection for American deaths from COVID-19 by August from 72,433 to 134,000.

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 71,000 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins University, with confirmed cases exceeding 1.2 million.

IHME’s projections reflect “the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11,” it said in a statement, “indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus.”

On Monday, Cuomo announced a detailed plan for reopening his state that would begin May 15 on a region-by-region basis. On Tuesday, though, he wanted to be clear about what reopening means.

“The fundamental question, which we’re not articulating, is, how much is a human life worth?” Cuomo said. “There is a cost of staying closed, no doubt, an economic cost. There’s also a cost of reopening quickly. The faster we reopen, the lower the economic cost but the higher the human cost because of more lives lost. That, my friends, is the decision we are really making.

“To me, I say, the cost of a human life is priceless. Period.”

Cuomo announced that New York lost 230 more lives on Monday, up from 226 the day before.

He took heat from reporters Tuesday as New York reported more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities. At least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state’s nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Cuomo late Monday that includes people believed to have been killed by the disease before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test.

The jump in deaths drew fresh attention to the state’s March 25 policy that said “no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.”

Cuomo said that nursing homes have the right to deny a COVID-19 patient’s return and that the state has facilities for such patients to stay between a visit to the hospital and returning to the nursing home. But Cuomo put the onus on nursing homes to make that call and seek the proper channels.

“We can’t turn hospitals into nursing homes,” he said.

The coronavirus outbreak has devastated nursing homes in many states, including Washington and California.

On Tuesday morning, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis went on Twitter to laud his policies on nursing homes. “In Florida we took swift action to protect our elderly and vulnerable residents in long-term care facilities,” he tweeted, and thanked Fox News for “highlighting these efforts.”

Later, DeSantis appeared at a drive-through testing site in Sarasota, where he held a briefing on where the state stands in its partial reopening. He framed his state — with more than 1,400 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins — as a coronavirus success story, though experts have warned that reopening before a state’s cases have consistently declined and widespread testing is available could cause a second wave.

DeSantis touted his policy that does not allow COVID-19 patients to return to nursing homes without two negative tests. “The other states that send COVID-positive patients back into nursing homes, that’s not been a good standard of practice,” he said. More than 420 residents or staff members at long-term care facilities have died from COVID-19, the state Department of Health reported last week.

The governor also promised that 200,000 antibody tests would be available for Floridians soon.

In New York City, De Blasio said that 140,000 antibody tests were coming available for use by first-responders and healthcare workers. The mayor thanked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for facilitating the help — and he asked for more, from the federal government, and from Trump in particular.

“Anyone watching with a heart and soul would say, ‘I want to help these people because they’ve done something so good, so decent,’ ” De Blasio said. “We’re just asking the president of the United States to care, actually care, about the people of this city, regardless of politics. You’d think a president who grew up here might have a special feeling for this place, might go out of his way to help his hometown. I’ll give him another chance to show that there’s a beating heart there, but these moments today show me something very cold.”

A few hours after De Blasio’s plea, Trump tweeted, “Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse!”

DMV Director Steve Gordon said he is planning to reopen the agency’s 170 field offices to in-person visits by appointment in phases, with 25 likely to open this month and all offices opening within about 30 days afterward.

“We have to go through all of the learning that we are going to do of how to [operate] in a COVID-19 world,” Gordon said during a conference call with reporters.

He said the schedule for reopening depends on approval from state health officials. Even then, customers will be asked to wear face masks and observe social-distancing rules inside the offices.

“We want them to be protected,” Gordon said. “We want ourselves to be protected.”

In the meantime, Gordon said, Californians can complete about 97% of DMV transactions online and at remote kiosks and other automated locations. Services available online include vehicle registrations renewals, vehicle title transfers, replacing lost driver’s licenses and temporary license extensions.

“We have done a lot of work over the past several months, building on top of some of the work we were already doing on Real ID, to really expand what we are doing online,” Gordon said.

Taking the written driving test, getting a photo for a license and taking an on-the-road driving test to qualify for a license must be done in person.

Road tests will be delayed for some weeks because of the close proximity required for tester and driver, Gordon said.

The DMV shut its field offices on March 27 amid concerns by employees and the public about the risk of transmitting the coronavirus in crowded offices where customers typically face long waits.

Since then, employees have been operating a DMV Virtual Office, where customers can transact business with help from workers.

Some pressure was relieved when the federal government approved a one-year delay in the deadline for people to apply for a Real ID card.

The DMV has also extended driver’s license expiration dates for residents younger than 70 until May 31.

In addition, the agency granted 120-day extensions for licenses of drivers 70 and older, a group that is particularly vulnerable to the virus and under caution to stay at home.

The DMV also said commercial driver licenses expiring between March and June are valid through June 30.

Gordon said Tuesday that work is underway to make the field offices safe for a return by the public.

Gavin Newsom announced his latest plans for easing stay-at-home restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Businesses such as bookstores, clothing stores, florists and sporting goods stores will be eligible to open for curbside pickup, according to County Executive Officer Michael Powers. Associated manufacturers and supply chains for these retail stores will also be allowed to open.

The county is expected to receive more guidance from the governor’s office before Friday on how such openings should be handled.

“Social distancing will stay with us for a while,” said Rigoberto Vargas, the county’s public health director, during Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting.

Vargas told the board that health officials are proceeding with optimism and caution, and that they’ll monitor the opening in case they need to reinstate stay-at-home measures.

Powers, board members and county Public Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin commended residents for abiding by state and county rules, even with restricted access to beaches.

Levin reflected back to 10 weeks ago, when the pandemic started to have an impact on everyday life and when he first estimated that there would be 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the county. His estimate later dropped to 250. As of Tuesday, the county had reported 19 coronavirus-related deaths.

“It’s so easy to forget what you prevented by your actions,” he said.

As of Tuesday, Ventura County had reported a total of 595 COVID-19 cases. The county also reported 22 current hospitalizations, with 11 patients under intensive care. There have been 416 recovered cases.

"['Staff Writer', 'Emily Alpert Reyes Covers City Hall For The Los Angeles Times.']",2020-05-05  ,Voices from the spectrum: Autistic people deal with the coronavirus,"When the coronavirus hit Southern California, Hector Ramirez tried to hang on to some of the guideposts in his usual routine: Waking up at 6 a.m. each day. Making his bed. Showering. Heading out to walk his service dog in his Chatsworth neighborhood.

Ramirez, who is autistic, used to try to greet at least 30 people before he returned home, a ritual that grounded him and connected him to the world. Now his walks are quiet; his routine, disrupted.

But Ramirez has had to cope with such stresses before. “Like many people with disabilities, I’ve dealt with social isolation whether I wanted it or not,” said Ramirez, 45, who spent part of his youth in an institution in Camarillo, separated from his family. “I have years of experience being separate from society.”

Autistic people have diverse experiences that resist easy generalization. But in recent interviews, a number of autistic adults say that although the pandemic can be especially stressful for people on the spectrum, many are practiced in dealing with the challenges — social isolation, disrupted routines, economic strain — that are now affecting the general population. And they hope that those experiences might help people who aren’t autistic to better understand them.

Uncertainty, unexpected events and a lack of control are “the major stressors for people on the spectrum,” said Barry M. Prizant, an adjunct professor at Brown University and author of “Uniquely Human: A Different Way of Seeing Autism.” Now that the coronavirus has hit, “that’s so much of what we’re talking about, as they are now major stress factors for neurotypical people — the rest of us.”

Maxfield Sparrow, writing in reaction to an article about people feeling drained as they try to read faces on video calls, points out that “we Autists live with these discomforts all our lives.”

And Sparrow adds: “If you are socially disoriented by Zoom and desperate for the pandemic to be over so you can return to comfortable, easy socializing, please lean into that feeling and remember it later.”

A wide spectrum

Autism is a developmental disability that can affect how people think, communicate, move, interact socially and process sensory information. It can shape how people live in a wide range of ways: Some autistic people need support with day-to-day living skills, while others live independently.

Some people on the spectrum are extremely verbal, while others may have limited or no speech and instead communicate in other ways. Some are keenly interested in specific topics. And many people with autism also have other disabilities that affect their day-to-day lives.

To make sense of a world that can be stressful and unpredictable, many autistic people have found comfort in routines or other coping mechanisms that address their unique needs. Routines, Prizant said, provide a “road map” for making the world more predictable.

“All human beings benefit from predictability in their lives,” Prizant added. “People on the spectrum crave it because there are so many more stressors in their lives.”

Many of those stresses have been exacerbated by the coronavirus. Julia Bascom, executive director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, said her group is deeply concerned that some autistic people might not be able to receive needed assistance with day-to-day tasks such as getting dressed, preparing meals or managing medication — services usually provided at home or in the community.

Children and teens on the autism spectrum may not be getting the added support they usually have in school, or they may be having trouble processing their online lessons.

And college students who are autistic have had to cope with campus closures as well. Mandy Wall, a Sarah Lawrence College senior who is about to graduate and who uses the pronoun “they,” said that when they first left campus and rejoined their parents in Connecticut, they “could barely function.” Sleep was impossible without a Xanax.

“My boyfriend had to remind me to brush my teeth and take a shower,” Wall said.

During the pandemic, autistic advocates have been especially alarmed that some states have set out guidelines for rationing ventilators and prioritizing healthcare, which, Bascom says, are “very clearly a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.”

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration was blasted by advocates for people with disabilities for initially advising hospitals to prioritize younger patients with longer life expectancy — guidelines that were then quietly removed and replaced.

And if all of those worries aren’t enough to process during the pandemic, adults with autism — who already tend to be economically marginalized — are also dealing with the stress of the economic collapse.

Ray Borene, an autistic 32-year-old who lives in Pennsylvania, recently had to stop working at “the only job I was ever able to succeed at.”

Borene, who was not diagnosed until adulthood, said that sensory issues led them to drop out of college and quit a string of jobs where they felt taxed by noise and bright lights. It wasn’t until Borene found work teaching pottery at a community studio that they thrived.

“I could really control my schedule. It’s very tactile. And instead of talking to people all day, it was hands on,” Borene said. “I really connected to the students.”

Advertisement

Then the coronavirus hit and the studio had to shut down, since “there’s no way of sterilizing everything.” Borene, who cannot drive, is now back at home at “a completely new level of isolation.”



Coping with stress

The pandemic has also highlighted the ways in which some autistic people have learned to cope with the kinds of stresses that now preoccupy the broader population.

“Being autistic, over the course of my life I’ve had to become very adept at creating coping mechanisms for things,” said Kris Guin, an autistic transgender man who lives in Washington, D.C. “The first couple of weeks were the hardest. But then I sort of learned to shift gears.”

Some people on the spectrum quip that they’re already pros at “social distancing” — either because social interaction can be stressful or because they have had to cope with unwanted isolation.

Carly Fulgham, president of Autism Society Ventura County, says that being able to step away from face-to-face interaction is a bit of a relief.

“Not having in-person interactions actually makes things easier,” said Fulgham, who was diagnosed with autism as an adult. Whenever she is talking to someone and they cross their arms, Fulgham said she becomes distracted trying to parse their behavior, wondering, “Does that mean they’re cold, or do they not want to talk to me anymore?”

And for autistic people who were bullied as children, Fulgham added, “social isolation can be a coping mechanism to keep themselves from being hurt again.”

Ido Kedar, a 23-year-old autistic author and student who lives in West Hills, had no way to communicate until he was 7 and started using a letter board. Kedar said in an email that “I laugh thinking that finally my autism is an advantage in life.”

“Yes, my many years being cut off from others makes me used to it, though I can’t say I like it,” Kedar wrote, explaining that those experiences had made him introverted.

As an introvert, “we need fewer people in our day,” he said, “but we still need people.”

In Phoenix, 46-year-old Carrie Serlin said she misses the people who used to be part of her routine: The bus drivers from Dial-a-Ride who shuttled her to her job at Social Spin Laundromat, which employs adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities; her supervisors; the people behind the counter where she gets an iced coffee.

At home, she continues to work during the day, braiding laundry baskets out of plastic bags for the laundromat to sell. When she does leave the house, “everyone is so worried about catching something that no one says, ‘Hi,’” she lamented.

Dena L. Gassner, an adjunct professor of autism studies at Towson University in Maryland, said she has seen a divide in how autistic people are faring, from some who say, “I’m living my best life” to others mired in anxiety.

“I worry a great deal about autistic people who don’t have the wherewithal to reach out for resources,” said Gassner, who is autistic and is currently a PhD candidate at Adelphi University on Long Island. “People who catastrophize, whose anxiety is not well-managed, and think in black and white — they’re at great risk right now.”

Ramirez still tries to connect with his neighbors, waving at people beyond his window. When he is out on his walks, sometimes people hold up written messages to him, such as “Nice to see you again” or “Can you help me get some eggs this week?”

He’s stepped up his volunteering at a food pantry that delivers meals, a new routine to restore his sense of purpose.

“People with disabilities are the experts in coping with social isolation,” said Ramirez, who is also a board member with Disability Rights California. “Not because we want to, but because we’ve had to.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/voices-from-the-spectrum-autistic-people-deal-with-the-coronavirus

Coronavirus upends the U.S. food system,"Near downtown Los Angeles, a meat processing plant ramped up production even as it worked to keep frontline employees separated from one another. In Salinas, Calif., a lettuce grower hustled to redirect supply after being forced to plow under unused crops.

In the Bay Area, a food distributor that previously served restaurants started selling produce boxes directly to consumers. Near the Mexico border, a food bank expanded distribution to meet an explosion of need. And in Hollywood, a nonprofit that has served sit-down meals to homeless people for 33 years shifted to takeout.

“We’ve completely had to change what we’re doing,” said Sherry Bonanno, executive director of the Hollywood Food Coalition. “We just keep adapting and adjusting.”

In less time than it takes a farmer to plant and harvest a head of lettuce, the nation’s entire food industry has been flipped on its head by the COVID-19 pandemic. An intricate system for matching supply with demand, established over decades, has been thrown out of whack just as unemployment and food insecurity are skyrocketing among families.

The fallout has been particularly severe in California, where more than a third of the country’s vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown — and where hunger and homelessness were already deeply entrenched.

In response, a vast network of food producers, distributors, retailers and advocates have been scrambling to find a new equilibrium, to shore up the nation’s food supply and their own bottom lines while reducing waste and want.

In dozens of interviews, farmers, truckers, grocery executives, restaurateurs, food service providers and food bank administrators from Northern California to the Imperial Valley said the effort has been exhausting, but worth it.

It all went haywire March 16, when Gov. Gavin Newsom asked restaurants to close their doors. The food service industry, which supplies restaurants and bars, as well as schools, hotels, production studios and catering services, immediately tanked. As nervous shoppers flocked to grocery stores to stockpile food, retail demand shot up, but not enough to make up for all the lost demand from restaurants.

“It was just a crazy swing,” said Scott Grabau, president and chief executive of Tanimura & Antle, a Salinas-based lettuce producer.

Crops planted months before based on pre-pandemic demand spoiled without buyers. Billions of dollars’ worth of produce went to waste, much of it tilled back into the soil, said Cathy Burns, CEO of the Produce Marketing Assn., which represents produce companies.

Grabau’s company, which grows year-round in California and Arizona, stopped harvesting entire fields. He’s thinking about planting more iceberg and romaine, which grocery shoppers buy, and less of the boutique leaves used by chefs.

Grabau’s team has had to be more agile than ever, packaging produce to fit orders that customers keep changing on the fly. He’s constantly in communication with his employees in the field.

“It’s a walkie-talkie call that says, ‘Hey, stop doing this. This order increased, so start doing this instead,’” Grabau said.

The meat processors

Few parts of the supply chain have been hit as hard as meat processing. Dozens of plants have been shuttered due to coronavirus outbreaks, prompting President Trump last week to order facilities to stay open as a matter of national security. Unions and others have objected, pointing to thousands of infections among meat workers.

Zack Levenson is chief operating officer for Golden West Food Group, based in Vernon, which produces beef, pork and chicken products.

The company, which has not had a known coronavirus infection in any of its facilities, slowed production for a couple of weeks to protect employees but has since maneuvered to expand capacity by millions of pounds of meat per week, Levenson said.

By good fortune, the company just weeks before the pandemic had commissioned the conversion of old dry-packing space in its main facility into more raw-meat processing space. That proved crucial for ramping up production at a time when employees had to be spaced farther apart, Levenson said.

For worker safety, the company began instituting special protocols early on, Levenson said. Masks were introduced, “hand sanitizer is everywhere,” new plastic dividers have been installed, and teams have been isolated, he said.

That way, if a line member gets ill, the company is able to quarantine his or her 10-member team without halting the entire operation.

The truckers

Zach England, chief operating officer of C.R. England, a Utah-based company that hauls produce and meat in refrigerated trucks across California and other states, said the pandemic has created a seesaw effect.

About 4,000 of his company’s 6,000 or so drivers regularly haul food. Demand for their services shot up in the early weeks of the pandemic as grocers struggled to stock shelves, but that has since leveled off.

Overall, there are more haulers on the hunt for work and less freight. Smaller trucking outfits are hurting; owner-operators are being paid less. The logistics involved in keeping truckers working, England said, have been intense.

Greg Dubuque, president of the California Trucking Assn. and owner of Liberty Linehaul West in Montebello, said trucking companies are “just trying to keep our wheels rolling to get to a better day.”

The distributors

Food service is a $303-billion industry, with 350,000 employees delivering 8.7 billion cases of product across the U.S. annually, according to Mark Allen, president and CEO of the International Foodservice Distributors Assn.

The industry “walked off the cliff” when restaurants and other businesses closed in the middle of March, with most distributors losing 60% to 90% of their volume, Allen said.

Ed Maybrun, owner of Cotati Food Service in Sonoma County, lost about 80% of his business overnight and has been hustling to stay afloat since.

He started storing more food for big customers in his freezers and looking for new inventory to sell. He took on deliveries for a local food bank and started breaking apart industrial-size packages of bread, paper products and other staples to sell directly to consumers.

“I’ve never worked so much for such a small piece of business in my life,” Maybrun said.



The restaurants

When the restaurants shuttered, a shock wave rippled out from owners and managers to servers, bartenders, dishwashers and cooks. It wasn’t pretty.

“We went straight into panic mode,” said Curtis Stone, the Australian chef who has cooked for the likes of Oprah Winfrey and has two high-end restaurants in the Los Angeles area: Maude and Gwen.

“We were like, ‘Oh my God, how do we just stay in business and make sure everyone gets their next paycheck?’” Stone said.

At first, there was no way. He simply couldn’t afford to keep on more than a dozen or so staff.

But that has since changed.

At Gwen, which always functioned in part as a butchery, Stone and his managers turned the restaurant into a sort of neighborhood market. They started doing a modest trade on eggs and milk, boxes of produce and prime cuts of meat.

They joined food delivery apps to connect with more customers. They created a new menu of comfort food for takeout. And they started replicating the process at Maude, which previously had been an exclusive 24-seat, three-course dining experience.

As the new model began to catch hold, Stone found he was able to start bringing staffers back.

“We made a decision early on as a team to not stand around and talk about how bad it is,” he said. “We just don’t have the time to be unproductive.”

The grocers

In the first weeks of the shutdown, customers cleared grocery shelves faster than they could be restocked, even though inventory was streaming in from suppliers. Shoppers were buying four to eight weeks worth of food at once.

There weren’t enough trucks to handle the demand, said Nancy Lebold, vice president of merchandising for Food 4 Less, a value grocer with a large customer base in the Latino community. At times, big orders just wouldn’t show up.

Normally, fruit accounts for 60% of produce sales, and vegetables the remainder. The first week of the shutdown, they flip-flopped, Lebold said, and have stayed that way ever since.

Advertisement

Other patterns of food consumption also were upended as people became reacquainted with their kitchens, and some automated supply processes were slow to respond, said Manny Vivanco, regional logistics director for the Kroger Co., which owns Ralphs and Food 4 Less.

Food 4 Less operates three inventory warehouses in the Los Angeles region: one in Paramount that is 98% automated, one in Compton that is about half-automated and one in Riverside that is not automated, relying instead on frontline associates.

As demand surged, the automated warehouses couldn’t keep up, Vivanco said. Meanwhile, workers in Riverside were cranking out increased orders.

Advertisement

In recent weeks, Kroger and other grocers have been trying to keep stores stocked even as dozens of workers have become ill, and unions have protested what they say are management failures to protect them.

The food banks

The COVID-19 chaos severely diminished the supply of free food to food banks, just as need surged.

Millions of Californians have lost work due to the pandemic. Many have been left hungry.

Advertisement

In the first three weeks of April, nearly 265,000 people applied for government food assistance under the CalFresh program — more than double the number who applied during the same period last year — according to the California Department of Social Services, which administers the program.

The number of people arriving at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano has doubled, said Cassidie Bates, the organization’s policy and advocacy manager.

“We have seen a completely new population emerge,” Bates said.

Meanwhile, grocery stores are selling more of their stock and passing on less food. Restaurants and other businesses that closed had lots of inventory to hand off to food banks in the first days of the shutdown, but that supply has run dry. And what was pulled in at the start of the pandemic has largely gone out the door already.

Advertisement

Food banks normally stockpile at this time of year, but demand is too high to hold back anything, Bates said.

The Imperial Valley Food Bank near the southern border, which normally serves 20,000 people each month, served more than 26,000 in the first three weeks of April, said Sara Griffen, the executive director.

Many of the food bank’s clients are farmworkers who have lost hours, a particularly cruel irony.

Griffen said local farmers have provided produce, but she still worries about protein, having recently received word that “quite a few” of her expected meat shipments had been canceled, likely due to closures of meat processing plants, she said.

The advocates

On a recent afternoon, Bonanno of the Hollywood Food Coalition was moving a mile a minute. She’s always busy, but more so with the move to a new model where clients no longer stream inside for warm meals but get handed their food outside.

“Everything is in a to-go bag,” she said.

Advertisement

On top of that, Bonanno said, her normal supply chains have collapsed.

Her group has long received food from the movie studios. A single day of production on a film or television set could yield enough leftover meals for hundreds of people on any given night. Now, all the studios have closed. Caterers, restaurants and groceries are providing less, too.

“Normally there’s tons of overproduction of food, and lots of different organizations will try to scramble to take that,” she said. “What’s been disrupted is the regular restaurant, caterers and grocery-store distribution system.”

Rick Nahmias, executive director of Food Forward, a nonprofit that collects food for redistribution, said his organization has been ramping up efforts in the face of huge need.

He started the group a decade ago, harvesting unused fruit from a single tree in his backyard. It grew to handling 2 million pounds of food per month. Amid the pandemic, it’s handling 800,000 pounds a week, scrambling to redirect excess farm produce to places like the Hollywood Food Coalition.

At distribution points where food is given directly to hungry Californians, “food that would last for three hours just a few months ago is now gone in five, 10, 15 minutes,” Nahmias said.



The future

Across the nation’s food web, people are nervous and frustrated. There is great need, but there is also hope for a future with less waste and more humanity.

“The whole world is trying to figure out how to rebalance the supply and demand,” said Chris Tang, a supply chain expert and professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. “We have so much food being wasted. The question is, how do you reduce the food waste so that the food will actually get to the people in need?”

Already, new lines of communication are opening between producers and those on the front lines of poverty and hunger. Tang hopes that government and the private sector will do even more to link the two. California, with its tech hubs and massive farms, could take the lead.

He sees a new, nationwide online platform where those with food can immediately be paired up with those who need it.

“Given that we are facing some of our darkest hours,” Tang said, “this is one bright spot.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/coronavirus-food-supply-chain-makers-distributors-retailers

She Loves Tips']",2020-05-05  ,"What’s open and closed this week: Beaches, parks and trails in Southern California","As long as Southern Californians remain close to home and wear masks outdoors, they can still exercise outdoors at many parks and beaches without violating Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order. But as the fight against the pandemic evolves and summer nears, the rules are rapidly changing, especially at beaches.

On Tuesday, Laguna Beach beaches opened after weeks of closure, but they will be open only from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. weekdays, for active use only, under a deal reached between local and state officials. They will remain closed on weekends.

In San Clemente too beaches reopened after an agreement between state and local leaders. In that case, the city’s beaches will be open daily for active use only (no fishing or sunbathing). The city’s pier reopened Tuesday with social distancing requirements. Beach restrooms and parking remain closed.

On Tuesday morning, state officials released letters authorizing Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Seal Beach officials to open their beaches. The letters, sent by Mark S. Ghilarducci, director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services; and Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the state Natural Resources Agency, say the cities have drafted beach management plans that conform with state rules, and the state urges local officials that “vigilance will be necessary” to keep citizens safe.

Meanwhile in the city of Los Angeles, officials said plans are in the works to completely close L.A.'s Griffith Park and other city parks on Mother’s Day (Sunday), in the same way those parks were closed on Easter to discourage crowds from gathering. No official announcement has been made, but those parks are likely to shut at sunset Saturday and reopen Monday morning.

Conflicts between cautious state officials and restless local leaders came to a head Thursday, when Newsom overruled local Orange County officials to close beaches in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach after they drew substantial weekend crowds. Most Orange County beaches remain closed under the governor’s action.

L.A. County’s beaches are still closed through May 15 under the county’s Safer at Home order, and local, state and federal agencies throughout the region are severely limiting access to hundreds of beaches, parks, trails and forests.

Ventura and San Diego counties have been gradually opening their beaches. In both of those counties, as in Orange County, officials have closed beach-adjacent parking lots, hoping to encourage people to stay within their own walking neighborhoods.

This list is designed to help readers keep track of beach restrictions.

Here’s an update on what’s happening where. If you do go outside for a walk, remember these tips for keeping safe. Local and state officials stress the need to take greater care in maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from others.



Los Angeles city parks, beaches and markets

City Recreation and Parks officials say most most park areas “remain open for walking and running.” But they are enforcing a range of restrictions. Among them: All public hiking trails and trailheads in the city of Los Angeles have been closed since March 27.

Advertisement

Also closed are all public beaches, public beach parking lots, beach bathrooms, piers, beach access points and the Venice Boardwalk and Ocean Front Walk (with limited access to essential businesses).

All recreation centers, aquatic facilities, golf courses, skate parks, tennis courts, playgrounds, baseball fields, soccer fields and basketball courts are also closed, as are other “indoor and outdoor sport amenities.”

In Griffith Park, authorities have closed all facilities and trails, including the Observatory, Travel Town, train rides, the pony rides, the merry-go-round and some roads. But the bicycle rental operation has been open.

Elsewhere, the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro remains closed, as is the Sherman Oaks Castle, the Expo Center in Exposition Park; and the Silver Lake Meadow. Since April 11, walkers and joggers have been required to travel counterclockwise on the 2.2-mile loop trail around the Silver Lake and Ivanhoe reservoirs.

Los Angeles County trails and beaches

Since March 27, L.A. County officials have enforced the closure of trails, trailheads, beaches and other public lands. (This list details closures.) All of the county’s park play and sports amenities, including golf courses, are also closed.

Los Angeles County’s beaches, piers, beach bike paths, beach access points, public trails, trailheads and tennis courts are also closed, under an order that covers beaches in every coastal city and unincorporated area of the county.

Parks officials noted on their website that “you can still enjoy time outdoors at your local park for passive use, such as walking, jogging, or leisure time outdoors for individuals or families. Social distancing is still required, and group gatherings are prohibited by the health order.”

Since March 23, the county has forbidden use of its multiuse trail system, a network of more than 220 miles that includes popular Eaton Canyon Trail; all interior trails at Vasquez Rocks; all interior trails at Placerita Canyon; the Loop Trail, Devil’s Chair and South Fork Trail at Devil’s Punchbowl; the San Dimas Nature Trail; the Schabarum-Skyline Trail; and dozens of other popular routes.



Los Angeles County beach cities and Catalina Island

• In Santa Monica, city beaches, the beach bike path and Ocean Front Walk closed March 27 as part of the countywide order to shut down beaches. The city’s Palisades Park, which overlooks the beach and pier, is also closed.

• In Hermosa Beach, the pier, Strand and beach itself are closed as part of the countywide beach closure.

• In Redondo Beach the pier, Strand and beach also are closed. City officials closed the Esplanade area; Veterans Park and nearby parking areas; all public walkways, stairways, ramps and paths to the beach; and a coastal bluff trail between Knob Hill Avenue and George Freeth Way.

• On Catalina Island, the Catalina Chamber of Commerce is urging non-residents to stay away. The Catalina Express, which usually runs boats to the island’s Avalon and Two Harbors landings from Long Beach, San Pedro and Dana Point, has cut back its service to two round trips a day between Long Beach and Avalon. At the Catalina Flyer, which normally offers one departure daily from Newport Beach to Avalon, a phone recording warned that the boat has suspended service until further notice. The Catalina Island Conservancy has closed its visitor facilities, services and trails.



State parks in Southern California

On March 18, state parks officials closed all state campgrounds. On March 29, they tightened restrictions further, closing vehicle access to the entire state park system — 280 parks, including off-road vehicle areas.

Since then, the state has fully closed dozens of parks, banning pedestrians as well as vehicles. Among them: The Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve; more than a dozen state parks and beaches in L.A. County; San Clemente State Beach in Orange County; seven state beaches in San Diego County; and four state beaches and parks in Ventura County.

But more recently, some parks have quietly reopened, while still keeping their roadways and parking lots closed to discourage visitors from outside the immediate area. On Monday morning, Carlsbad, South Carlsbad and Torrey Pines state beaches reopened that way, with visitors limited to active recreation and no group gatherings.

Advertisement

At Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area in the Baldwin Hills area of L.A., officials said in a statement that the park is closed to vehicular access but “remains open for locals who wish to walk, hike and bike (in parks with bike trails) in the park, provided they practice social/physical distancing of 6 feet or more. This is not the time for a road trip to a destination park or beach.”



San Gabriel Valley

In the first week of April, Pasadena city officials closed the Rose Bowl Loop, a popular 3.1-mile- walking path around the famed stadium.

The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino is closed through at least May 15.

Descanso Gardens in La Cañada Flintridge is closed until further notice. The L.A. Arboretum in Arcadia is open; reservations are required to prevent crowding.

Santa Monica Mountains

The National Park Service has imposed weekend closures on all Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area trails, trailheads, restrooms, overlooks and pullouts in Ventura County. Authorities said those areas will remain open on weekdays, when crowds are thinner.

Those weekend closures begin at 2 p.m. Fridays and reopen at 6 a.m. Mondays “until further notice,” an NPS release said.

That policy covers Rancho Sierra Vista (including the Wendy Trailhead); Cheeseboro Canyon Trailhead; the Deer Creek area; and all trails within Circle X, which includes Sandstone Creek, Mishe Mokwa, the Grotto Trail, the trails and overlooks along Yerba Buena Road and the Backbone Trail along the spine of the Santa Monicas.

As part of the earlier L.A. County-wide closure of hiking trails, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area had already shut down all of its trails and restrooms in L.A. County.

Advertisement

Also, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority on March 23 closed all of its parklands, trail and facilities — close to 75,000 acres of parkland, including all parks owned by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.

The authority’s busiest parks, now closed, include Wilacre Park in Studio City; Temescal Gateway Park in Pacific Palisades; Franklin Canyon Park off Mulholland Drive, Beverly Hills; Ed Davis Park in Towsley Canyon, the Santa Clarita Valley; all the overlooks on Mulholland Drive; Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve at the west end of Victory Boulevard; and Escondido Canyon Park in Malibu.



Ventura County

• Ventura County has allowed the opening of county-managed beaches, golf courses and bike shops among various modifications to its Stay Well at Home order. That order, which continues to close campgrounds, gyms, swimming pools and many other facilities, is effective through May 15.

•The city of Ventura on April 20 reopened its beaches, pier, promenade and parks, subject to requirements that people keep their distance and don’t linger.

Advertisement

• The city of Port Hueneme, experimenting with a “soft reopening,” has reopened its beach (and a parking lot) to walking, running, biking and solo surfing and paddleboarding, but said it would discourage sunbathing or any “stationary presence” on the sand. Its pier, restrooms, playground and street parking remain closed.



Orange County

On April 25 and 26, many of the county’s shores, especially in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, were so crowded that photographs alarmed many people. The governor was one of them, and he briefly shut all of Orange County’s beaches.

Since then, state officials have negotiated terms for reopening several cities’ beaches in the county. This list covers the beaches city by city.

Parking lots at all county beaches, regional and wilderness parks remain closed as well. So are parking spaces at all trailheads; parking lots at Irvine Lake; parking along Black Star Canyon Road; pedestrian access points at Thousand Steps, Table Rock, West, Camel Point and Treasure Island beaches; restrooms; playgrounds; exercise equipment; shelters and trailheads. Pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians were permitted.

Advertisement

Orange County also banned vehicular traffic to Carbon Canyon, Clark, Craig, Irvine, Laguna Niguel, Mason, Mile Square, Tri-City and Yorba regional parks. Pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians were permitted.

Orange County’s Supervisors have cleared the way for public and private golf courses to open.

Throughout Los Angeles County

The Safer at Home order from Los Angeles County Public Health officials, issued March 21 and updated April 10, prohibits all public and private group events and gatherings through May 15. It also says that individuals and families are not prohibited from “hiking, walking, biking or shopping at [e]ssential [b]usinesses,” as long as they keep their distance from others.

The order also notes that if local entities (such as municipal governments) choose to impose stricter limits, the county order does not supersede them.

Los Angeles County has closed all indoor and outdoor playgrounds, along with indoor shopping centers and all swap meets and flea markets.



Inland Empire

• San Bernardino County on April 25 reopened county parks, lakes, rivers and recreation areas. “Private and city-owned parks, trails, lakes and golf courses also opened on a limited basis,” the L.A. Times Luke Money reports. Big Morongo Canyon Preserve and Mojave River Forks Regional Park are still closed.

• Riverside County leaders on April 20 allowed golf courses to reopen, with restrictions. Hiking, bikes and horseback-riding on trails and in parks are also permitted under the county’s health order.



San Diego County parks and beaches

San Diego County Board of Supervisors reopened county-run beaches there April 27 to swimming, surfing, kayaking and paddle-boarding but not group activities, sunbathing or boating.

City-by-city details are covered in this list.

Most of San Diego County’s parks and preserves have remained open for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians, but their parking lots and many facilities and amenities are closed.



National forests in Southern California

The U.S. Forest Service has closed campgrounds, picnic areas, bathrooms and other developed recreation sites in its California forests through May 15, leaving Southern California’s four forests — Angeles, Cleveland, Los Padres and San Bernardino — to make their own decisions on trail access and parking.

• In the Angeles National Forest, authorities on April 3 closed 23 well-used San Gabriel mountain trails, four popular trailheads and 19 roads.

Advertisement

This map shows the affected areas. The closures include the Millard Canyon above Altadena, San Antonio Falls, Icehouse Canyon and North Devil’s Backbone trailheads.

The forest order shuts routes to Echo Mountain and Mt. Lowe, such as the Sam Merrill Trail, above Altadena, as well as others leading to Mt. Wilson, San Gabriel Peak, the Rim Trail and other routes in the San Gabriel Mountains.

• In the San Bernardino National Forest, whose 680,000 acres include four mountain ranges in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, a spokesman said trails, trailheads, staging areas that function as trailheads and parking areas at trailheads remain open. Hikers should practice social distancing, sticking to wide fire roads instead of single-track trails that are too narrow, the spokesman said.

• In Los Padres National Forest, which includes about 1.95 million acres reaching north from Ventura County into Central California, spokesman Andrew Madsen said trailhead parking and trails remain open, as do dispersed camp sites in the backcountry.

Advertisement

• In Cleveland National Forest, which reaches into San Diego, Riverside and Orange counties, the list of sites closed includes all trails and picnic areas where an Adventure Pass is usually required.

In the forest’s Trabuco ranger district, closures include: El Cariso north/south picnic area; Hot Springs trailhead; San Juan loop trailhead; Tenaja trailhead; Trabuco creek picnic area; Wildomar staging area; Maple Springs day-use area.

In the forest’s Descanso Ranger District, closures include Agua Dulce; Bear Valley OHV (off-highway vehicle) area; and Corral Canyon.

In the forest’s Palomar Ranger District, closures include Crestline; Henshaw scenic vista; Inaja Memorial; Kica Mik Overlook; Palomar Mountain Interpretive Station; San Luis Rey Picnic Area; Fry Creek Trailhead; Observatory Trailhead; and Barker Valley Trailhead. The popular Cedar Creek Falls and Three Sisters Falls trails have been closed since March 21.

National parks in California

The National Park Service closed Yosemite National Park on March 20; Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks on March 25; Joshua Tree National Park on March 31; and Death Valley National Park (except for California 190 and Daylight Pass) on April 4.

Gavin Newsom has announced that some stay-at-home rules will be modestly eased later this week.

He said details would be provided later in the week, but here are some highlights:

Businesses that can open

Bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, sporting goods retailers, clothing stores and others can reopen for pickup as early as Friday. Additional businesses could be named later this week, also with curbside pickup.

Advertisement

Right now, only essential businesses such as grocery stores, drug stores, medical offices, gas stations and auto repair are open, with social distancing. Factories that supply those businesses would also be allowed to resume.

Businesses that can’t

Offices, shopping malls, and seated dining at restaurants are still ordered shut. Personal grooming businesses, entertainment venues, live concerts and sports are also not included in the first phase of Newsom’s reopening plan.

Local controls

Advertisement

There will be more decision-making at the local level, allowing some communities to move further at their own pace instead of adhering to a uniform policy across the state. Some rural counties that have not been hard hit by the coronavirus have been asking for this.

Benchmarks

If counties want to do more, they must first meet certain requirements for hospital beds, testing kits and the ability to track infected people and trace their contacts.

Advertisement

While some counties want to reopen now, other more hard-hit counties in the Bay Area and Southern California are urging caution.

Newsom said communities that reopen businesses more slowly, like the San Francisco Bay Area, can still do so. Pandemic conditions vary widely throughout the state, he said.

Varying conditions

Some counties — Modoc, Yuba and Sutter counties in Northern California — have defied Newsom’s orders and allowed more or all kinds of businesses to reopen beyond the statewide order.

Advertisement

The governor declined to say Monday whether there would be consequences for those counties. He added that the overwhelming majority of California’s 58 counties are doing the right thing.

Los Angeles County’s public health director, Barbara Ferrer, said Monday that officials will be sharing its recovery plans this week. “Wherever it’s possible to safely reopen, we’ll be doing so as quickly as possible,” she said.

California is in Phase One of the governor’s reopening plan. The easing planned for this week would cover Phase Two.

Advertisement

“We are entering into the next phase this week,” Newsom said at his Monday news conference. “This is a very positive sign, and it’s happened only for one reason: The data says it can happen.”

Stage 1: safety and preparedness

This phase is now underway.

Continue to build out testing and contact-tracing capabilities and hospital surge capacity.

Continue to make workplaces as safe as possible for essential workers.

Work on adaptations to the physical setting and workflow in hospitals and other settings.

Build a safety net for essential workforce.

Make personal protective equipment more widely available.

Incorporate individual behavior changes.

Prepare safety guidelines for an expanded force of front-line workers.

Stage 2: Retail and lower-risk workplaces reopen.

Advertisement

Beginning Friday:

More retail stores (with curbside pickup)

Manufacturing and logistics to support retail

Later on:

Offices (when teleworking is not possible)

Additional public spaces

Modified schools programs and child care

Potentially beginning the academic school year in July or August

An expanded workforce safety net could mean:

Wage replacement so workers can stay home when sick.

Adaptions for reopened schools and child-care facilities could mean:

Advertisement

Summer programs and an earlier start to the next academic year, in July or August.

What’s needed to get from Stage 1 to Stage 2?

Government actions:

Enacting policies that allow people to stay home when they’re sick.

Providing guidance on how to reduce coronavirus risk.

Business actions:

Advertisement

Provide wage replacement so workers can stay home when sick.

Implement adaptations to lower-risk workplaces.

Allow employees to continue to work from home when possible.

Individual actions:

Use safety precautions, such as physical distancing and wearing masks.

Avoid all nonessential travel.

Support and care for people who are at high risk.

Key goals to hit before moving to Stage 2:

Hospitalization and ICU trends are stable.

Hospital surge capacity can meet demand.

There is sufficient personal protective equipment to meet demand.

Testing capacity is sufficient to meet demand.

There’s contact-tracing capacity statewide.

The transition to Stage 2 will occur through a statewide modification to the stay-at-home order.

Opportunity for regional variations

Advertisement

During Stage 2, counties may choose to relax stricter local orders at their own pace.

After Stage 2, once a statewide COVID-19 surveillance system is made possible through testing, further regional variations could be supported.

The state will consult and collaborate closely with local governments.

Stage 3: Higher-risk workplaces reopen

Advertisement

The following sectors reopen:

Personal care (hair and nail salons, gyms)

Entertainment venues (movie theaters, sports without live audiences)

In-person religious services (churches, weddings)

Stage 4: Stay-at-home order ends

At this point, therapeutics will have been developed and other key goals met. These events and sites will then reopen:

Concerts

Convention centers

Sports events with live audiences

Worried about getting the coronavirus at work?

While many people are working from home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of Californians with jobs deemed essential still head to their workplaces each day. Are you concerned that your employer isn’t keeping you adequately protected? Samantha Masunaga and Thuc Nhi Nguyen looked into what you can do .

There’s no sugarcoating it: Workers who fear they’re being exposed to the virus on the job are in a tough position. The state agency that enforces workplace safety — California’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health, known as Cal/OSHA — is receiving a large volume of COVID-19 workplace complaints, and even labor advocates suggest employees think carefully before refusing a boss’ order to perform hazardous work.

“Employers can retaliate, and that retaliation may be illegal, but its consequences will likely be very immediate,” said Stephen Knight, executive director of Worksafe, a worker advocacy group. “Any redress will take much longer to pursue with the system.”

But it’s still critical to keep filing complaints, says Alice Berliner, coordinator for the Southern California Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health. “It’s really important that the state and Cal/OSHA know that COVID cases are still happening in workplaces, that workers are still being put at risk.” You can also file a report with your county’s department of public health. And you can try reaching out to media organizations if there has been a large number of coronavirus cases in your workplace. (The Times is always looking for news tips.)

When bringing up concerns about coronavirus exposure, labor advocates advise, workers should approach their employer as a group — showing that the issue is a collective problem — rather than one by one. Unionized workers can turn to their union representatives, and workers who are not represented by a union may find it helpful to reach out to worker centers or community advocacy groups. A few examples: the Garment Worker Center, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, the Los Angeles Black Worker Center and the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance.

Reader question

A reader asks us: If I filled out my unemployment claim wrong, can I edit it or refile it?

Emmanuel Morgan got in touch with California’s Employment Development Department to track down the answer to this question. If you need to change information on an unemployment claim, you’ll need to contact the EDD , and the department said the most direct way to do that is using the “contact” feature on its UI Online tool.

However, the swell of layoffs and furloughs in the last month means the EDD is receiving a high volume of calls and processing unusually large numbers of claims, so getting immediate attention from a representative may be difficult. It is possible to update your address or phone number through UI Online without having to speak with a representative.

The lawsuit, brought by state Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra and the city attorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, seeks restitution for unpaid wages it says are owed to drivers, and it requests that the court force the companies to immediately classify their drivers as employees.

Filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, the suit argues that Uber and Lyft gave themselves an unfair market advantage by dodging expenses including drivers’ wages and local and state payroll taxes. The law enables plaintiffs to seek up to $2,500 in civil penalties per violation for drivers going back four years.

At a video news conference Tuesday, Becerra said the coronavirus outbreak had laid bare the lack of protections for drivers. “Sometimes it takes a pandemic to shake us,” he said.

The lawsuit comes after California’s Assembly Bill 5, which took effect Jan. 1, established stricter standards for which workers can be treated as independent contractors rather than employees. AB5 empowers California’s attorney general and city attorneys to force companies to provide minimum wage, overtime pay, workers’ compensation, and unemployment and disability insurance to workers who meet the legal test for employee classification.

Gig economy companies have largely opposed the legislation.

Lyft said in a statement it is “looking forward to working with the Attorney General and mayors across the state to bring all the benefits of California’s innovation economy to as many workers as possible, especially during this time when the creation of good jobs with access to affordable healthcare and other benefits is more important than ever.”

Uber, also alluding to the high unemployment caused by the coronavirus crisis, said California should “make it easier, not harder, for people to quickly start earning. We will contest this action in court, while at the same time pushing to raise the standard of independent work for drivers in California, including with guaranteed minimum earnings and new benefits,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

Drivers and labor groups, which have staged rallies calling for the state to enforce AB 5, celebrated the lawsuit.

“Billionaires like to pick and choose what laws they follow,” said Carlos Ramos, a driver and organizer with Gig Workers Rising, an advocacy group that represents on-demand platform workers. “Today, California is showing that no one is above the law, not even big tech.”

Over the years, Uber and Lyft have battled numerous lawsuits alleging the companies have misclassified workers. Since February, more than 2,000 California ride-hailing drivers have filed claims against the companies, alleging Uber and Lyft owe them more than $630 million in lost wages, expenses and damages.

In response to a lawsuit brought by Lyft drivers, a federal judge in San Francisco said last month that drivers are employees under AB 5. “It’s obvious” AB 5 was intended to apply to drivers at companies like Lyft, and refusing to reclassify drivers Lyft is “really disregarding the rule of law,” U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said during a April 2 teleconference, according to Bloomberg .

Still, Chhabria rejected an emergency motion to immediately classify drivers seeking sick pay as employees amid the coronavirus outbreak, saying the case was filed hurriedly and “riddled with defects.”

The companies say they do not employ the drivers but rather act as intermediaries between drivers and riders. They anticipated a crackdown by the state, and have mounted a vehement campaign against AB 5, spending the better part of 2019 working to derail the bill before state lawmakers approved it.

Two days before the law went into effect, Uber and delivery startup Postmates filed a suit alleging that AB 5 violates individuals’ constitutional rights and unfairly discriminates against technology platforms and those who make a living through such platforms.

Uber and Lyft, along with other gig-economy companies, have poured $110 million into a ballot measure in California that could serve as an alternative to AB 5. The measure would create a third category of work in between contracting and employment.

Advertisement

During Tuesday’s news conference, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said the ballot campaign would not affect the state’s lawsuit even if the gig companies are successful in their efforts to overturn AB 5. The law simply codifies and clarifies the state supreme court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West vs. Superior Court, which established the stricter test that determines whether a worker is a contractor or employee. That ruling would remain in effect.

Ride-hailing companies are just one category of California businesses that have pushed back against the new law. For instance, the trade group representing California newspapers has asked lawmakers to exclude newspaper delivery workers from being classified as employees, saying the move could further weaken the fiscal health of some publications. Management of the Los Angeles Times, as well as the paper’s editorial board, has supported that effort.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a briefing Tuesday that he planned to request more money in the state budget for the purpose of enforcing AB 5.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-05-05/california-sues-uber-lyft-alleging-ab5-worker-misclassification

During a hearing, the state’s highest court did not clearly indicate which way it would rule. Only four of the court’s seven justices asked questions, and those who did speak challenged both sides in the dispute.

The court is considering a challenge by unions to a 2012 law that forbade the practice of “pension spiking” for all government employees. The practice involves inflating a future pensioner’s pay, usually at the end of their career, by cashing in years of accumulated vacation or sick pay or volunteering for extra duties.

Because pension payments are calculated based on a worker’s highest year of earnings, spiking can produce a more lucrative retirement than what the employee earned on the job. At least 1 million public employees in California will be affected by the court’s decision.

Unions and public employee groups across the state contend the law violates the 60-year California Rule, which says employees are entitled to the pension they were promised on their first day of work. Courts have ruled that public pensions are contracts protected by the state and U.S. constitutions.

Rei Onishi, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s deputy legal affairs secretary, told the court that governments in California now face massive cutbacks, layoffs and furloughs, a reference to the anticipated budget deficits stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.

He called pension spiking “abusive” and said the practice was “never lawful.” In barring it, he said, the state Legislature merely clarified the law and closed loopholes. He also contended that the law was prospective and therefore did not rob any workers of promised benefits.

Three of the justices appeared skeptical that the changes were merely prospective. “Employees who are currently working might view this as not prospective,” said Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar. “They are arguing they had a set of expectations that are being violated.”

Justice Goodwin Liu also suggested that what is now called pension spiking may have been presumed to be perfectly legal in past years.

David E. Mastagni, representing the Alameda County Deputy Sheriff’s Assn., argued the words “pension spiking” amounted to an “inherently subjective political term.”

He said employees were recruited and told they could depend on the pension rules in place. “My clients were promised they would have deferred compensation,” he said.

Justice Joshua P. Groban, appearing frustrated, asked the lawyer to imagine a “massive economic downturn” and a “doomsday scenario” when pension systems are “on the brink.” He wanted to know: Can there never be any changes?

Mastagni said counties in such cases could ease financial pressures by negotiating additional employee contributions.

In California, the formula for calculating retirement income generally can be changed only if it is neutral or advantageous to employees. It cannot be reduced, except for new hires.

California has been a national leader in pension law, and other states are paying close attention to the outcome of a series of cases testing the government’s ability to make cuts for longtime employees.

After the great recession, former Gov. Jerry Brown tackled the pension shortfall, signing new measures into law. The judiciary, which benefited from past public pension rulings, was exempt from the new cutbacks. Now the pandemic is creating another fiscal crisis for state and local government.

As expected, it wasn’t pretty.

The Burbank giant’s profit dropped dramatically during the three months that ended in March, the month that fears of the COVID-19 pandemic closed Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World, halted film and TV production and suspended live sports indefinitely.

Earnings for the second fiscal quarter fell 63% from the same period last year to 60 cents a share, the company said Tuesday. That was worse than Wall Street anticipated. Analysts polled by FactSet on average had expected 89 cents a share. Net income fell 91% to $475 million.

Disney estimated that the business missed out on $1 billion in operating income because of the theme park closures during the quarter, which ended March 28. About half of the $1-billion hit was from the company’s U.S. theme parks, which were closed for just two weeks during the period. International parks and cruise ships accounted for the rest, Disney said.

Disney closed its domestic parks and Disneyland Paris in mid-March amid the growing public health concerns surrounding the novel coronavirus.

The crisis has taken a major toll on the broader media industry, but Disney in particular has suffered because of its reliance on in-person experiences such as parks, movie theaters, cruise ships and retail stores.

The outbreak came just as Disney was transitioning to new leadership, with Bob Iger stepping aside from the chief executive role in late February to make way for his successor, Bob Chapek, who previously ran the parks and resorts empire.

“The challenges we’re now facing are unprecedented,” Iger said on a call with analysts. However, he added, “I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period.”

To weather the shutdowns, Disney has added billions of dollars to its debt load, slashed executive salaries and furloughed more than 100,000 of its 223,000 employees. The furloughs have hit tens of thousands of parks and cruise workers , as well as employees at the company’s movie studio division.

“We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows,” Chapek said on the call. “While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones.”

The company on Tuesday said it would forgo its semiannual dividend for shareholders, saving about $1.6 billion in cash.

Disney stock fell about 2% in after-hours trading on Wall Street, after the earnings release. Before the financial report, the stock closed down $2.12, or 2%, to $101.06 on Tuesday.

Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield, a frequent critic of the company, described the coronavirus-driven downturn in stark terms in a blog post for clients. “Disney has gone from being on top of the world a la Lion King, to feeling like Eeyore stuck in the middle of a perfect storm with no end in sight,” Greenfield wrote.

Parks, experiences and products — normally the company’s biggest segment in terms of sales — saw revenue fall 10% to $5.54 billion in the quarter. Operating income was $639 million, down 58% from the prior-year second quarter.

Disney’s parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been closed since January, when the outbreak was spreading in China. Tokyo Disneyland shut down in late February to help slow the spread of infections.

Shanghai Disneyland will be the first Disney resort to reopen. It will do so May 11 with strict limits on capacity and requirements such as masks for employees and guests.

When Disney might reopen its domestic parks is a matter of great speculation. An analyst for J.P. Morgan predicted the parks could open as soon as June 1, but an analyst for Swiss banking giant UBS projected an opening for Jan. 1. Both analysts cautioned that attendance would probably lag below previous numbers for months. Disney has declined to comment on a reopening date for parks in Anaheim and Orlando, Fla.

The company’s film segment generated $466 million in operating income, down 8% year over year. Revenue was $2.54 billion, up 18%.

The theatrical run of Disney’s latest movie, Pixar’s “Onward,” was cut short because of cinema closures. It was quickly released on video-on-demand sites and, later, on Disney’s streaming service Disney+. Disney’s next release is “Mulan,” a live-action remake that was moved to a July 24 premiere after its original March 27 release was canceled. U.S. cinema chains are hoping to begin reopening in mid-June or early July. Films such as Marvel’s “Black Widow” and Pixar’s “Soul” have been delayed.

Disney’s TV segment — which includes ABC, ESPN and other networks — fared better. Operating income was $2.38 billion, up 7%, thanks to an increase in revenue from the inclusion of 21st Century Fox cable networks.

ESPN, which was already struggling from a loss of customers from cord-cutting, has been pummeled by the shutdown, losing much of its main draw: live sports.

However, the network currently has a ratings hit in “The Last Dance,” a 10-part documentary about former NBA star Michael Jordan’s career with the Chicago Bulls. The network’s “at home” coverage of the NFL draft was also a success.

Additionally, Disney+ has proved a popular refuge for sequestered families. The app, which launched in November with shows such as “The Mandalorian,” has hit 54.5 million global subscribers after launching in Western Europe and India.

Disney’s direct-to-consumer and international segment — composed of Disney+, Hulu and other units —continued to lose money as the company invested in growing its digital prowess to compete with Netflix and others.

The direct-to-consumer businesses lost $812 million, more than double the loss from the same quarter last year. Streaming and international revenue surged to $4.12 billion from $1.15 billion a year earlier.

Total revenue for Disney was $18 billion, up 21% from a year earlier largely because of the inclusion of sales from 21st Century Fox businesses. Analysts had estimated $17.8 billion in revenue.

The pre-pandemic staging of a baseball game in Dodger Stadium required “a symphony of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people,” in the words of Stan Kasten, the team’s president and chief executive officer.

If baseball returns this summer, that philharmonic convergence of players, coaches, executives, medical staff, media, clubhouse attendants, ushers, vendors, concessionaires, security guards, parking attendants, plumbers and electricians will be reduced to the stadium-employee equivalent of a string quartet.

Fans are expected to be excluded from the start of an abbreviated 2020 season, whether games are played in home parks with the league divided into three 10-team regional divisions (increasingly likely); games are played in Florida, Texas and Arizona (doubtful); or 30 teams begin play in the Phoenix area (highly unlikely).

Advertisement

That would eliminate the need for the bulk of the 1,800 or so spectator-related stadium employees Kasten and Angels team President John Carpino say are required for regular-season home games.

In an effort to reduce the exposure to and possible spread of the coronavirus, Major League Baseball is expected to limit stadium access to “essential personnel.” But who would be considered essential, and who would not?

The list is likely longer than expected at first glance.

“It becomes a math model — the more people you have, the greater risk of someone either having the virus or spreading the virus,” Carpino said. “I’ve been looking at how we could do this without fans, and you keep thinking, ‘We don’t need anybody.’

“Then you’re like, what about security? Oh yeah. What about cooks in the clubhouse dining room? Oh yeah. What about a statistician? Oh yeah. What about a video guy? Oh yeah. Before you know it, you have three dozen oh yeahs. I don’t know how to attack it, almost.”

Kasten said the Dodgers have been working on models for “essential” game crews, but with no plan or date for a startup firmly in place, clarity remains elusive.

“As soon as it came up, we started looking at it, and it’s just like with everything else — we still have more questions than answers,” Kasten said. “It’s going to depend on what guidance we are given from baseball, from the city and the state, on what restrictions will be imposed for us to play a game without fans.”

MLB officials have been in constant contact with teams, the players association and medical experts as they formulate a path forward, but the league is “not ready to go in-depth on this topic at this time,” a spokesman said this week.

“I’m relying on direction from MLB, it’s something they’re talking about nonstop, seven days a week,” Angels general manager Billy Eppler said. “They’re asking clubs for feedback, they’re crowd-sourcing a lot of these questions, and they’ll come up with the infrastructure that puts the health and safety of the players and people around them at the forefront of every decision.”

Kasten and Carpino said they expect MLB to issue a consistent set of guidelines to teams with limits on the number and types of uniformed and non-uniformed personnel allowed in the stadium.

Both executives estimated an “essential” group would require at least 100 people, consisting of 30-35 players, a manager, 11-12 coaches, a medical staff of 10-12 — including physicians, athletic trainers and strength-and-conditioning coaches — an equipment manager, four or five clubhouse attendants, two video-room coordinators, a traveling secretary and a handful of front-office executives.

“Will there be limitations on [clubhouse attendants]? Do both teams have the same number of trainers, doctors and X-ray technicians, or will the home team provide them?” Kasten said. “Are we supposed to operate the scoreboards? Do we need a public address announcer?

“Then there’s the whole world of the media. Are there restrictions on the numbers allowed in a stadium? Do we have pool reporting? How do we [keep reporters] separate? Are there personal interviews or is everything piped into the press box? I don’t know. Oh, we’ve got questions, man, lots of questions.”

One approach would be to have a bubble within the bubble — limiting access to the field and clubhouse to one group while allowing others access to the stadium only.

The former group would include those mentioned above, as well the four umpires, an MLB video-room monitor, two or three drug-testers on days tests are administered, a clubhouse security guard, six to 12 grounds-crew members, a handful of kitchen employees and a cleaning crew.

The latter group could include broadcasters, television and radio crew members, writers, an official scorekeeper, P.A. announcer, scoreboard and video board operators, media relations officials, baseball equipment distributors, facility maintenance crews of plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and mechanics and — at least, in the case of Dodger Stadium — organist Dieter Ruehle.

“Even right now, with the stadium closed, we have at least six people there every day,” Carpino said. “And we still have security on site.”

Advertisement

If MLB imposes strict limits on stadium access, it could have TV and radio announcers broadcast games from off-site studios and writers cover games off TV with post-game interviews conducted via video chat.

One area no one wants to scrimp on is medical staffing.

“You have the skill-development side, which is your on-field coaching group, and the medical side, which is your physical therapists, athletic trainers, chiropractor, massage therapist,” Eppler said. “By and large, in all these models, we’re still talking about playing a physical game that requires a certain standard of care, and you don’t want to take that away from your athletes.”

Another issue MLB must address: If there is no minor league season, teams will have to carry taxi squads of at least 15-20 players who will need coaching, medical care, athletic training and games — with umpires — to stay sharp.

Will they work out and play in home stadiums, greatly increasing the number of people in the bubble, or at another facility?

“It’s a lot of moving parts,” Carpino said, “but I feel like MLB is definitely on it and looking at everything, and we’re looking at them to give everybody direction.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-05-05/mlb-personnel-empty-stadiums-dodgers-stan-kasten-angels-john-carpino

As government officials evaluate the medical and societal impacts of reopening parts of the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Major League Baseball must decide whether bringing its sport back and televising it to homebound fans is a worthwhile risk.

Support is mounting for MLB to spearhead the return to pseudo-normality. Some believe games could start by late June and that the abbreviated season could feature 100 games. Getting to that point would require some finesse.

It seems the only safe way to stage baseball this year would be with no fans in attendance. Any model likely would not include the minor leagues, would expand MLB rosters from their current 26 players and would require a taxi squad of reserves in case of injury. Virus testing would be necessary for anyone expected to enter a stadium. And players would require at least three weeks of spring training to prepare for the abbreviated season.

With that in mind, let’s look at three spectator-free proposals MLB is reportedly considering: a realignment that would allow teams to operate in their respective cities, an enclosed 30-team operation in Arizona, and a three-state hub.

Play and practice at home

Mike Trout and Clayton Kershaw objected to separating from their loved ones for prolonged stretches. So remaining in the Los Angeles area for another round of spring training and playing the regular season in familiar settings, while following local virus-combating procedures, would be palatable to them.

The basics of the plan, as reported by USA Today :

Players would have access to most of the spoils of a regular season — MLB stadiums, familiar surroundings and charter flights, among other things — without sacrificing proximity to family.

Teams would play only within three geographically friendly divisions during the regular season, which would limit travel to one region of the country. The format would change in the postseason.

The number of people admitted into baseball’s work environments would be limited (likely to team officials and personnel, umpires and other game officials, broadcast crew and stadium staff), and all would be screened regularly for COVID-19 symptoms.

The wide-reaching system could be risky because players would return to their families after home games and their movements likely wouldn’t be closely monitored.

Behind-the-scenes dealings with government officials could also complicate matters. The 30 teams play in 28 cities. So not only would MLB have to contend with the policies of 17 states, Washington, D.C., and Toronto, it would also have to coordinate with the governments of 27 counties, the District of Columbia and the province of Ontario as well as respective city ordinances.

Exceptions would have to be made. In California, home to an MLB-leading five teams, sporting events without live audiences are not expected to be held until the third stage of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s four-phase plan for modifying stay-at-home orders is reached. That might not occur until August or September . But the governor indicated when he eased restrictions Monday that decision-making will be expanded to the local level.

Support might not be hard to come by. President Trump, Govs. Greg Abbott (Texas), Andrew Cuomo (New York) and Tom Wolf (Pennsylvania), and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot have encouraged baseball’s return this year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred last week, “America needs baseball.”

One feature of this plan would be especially sweet for Dodgers fans: The West division could pit the Dodgers against the Angels, San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners … and the Houston Astros, found guilty by MLB of cheating in their run-up to defeating the Dodgers in the 2017 World Series.

Send everyone to Arizona

The least risky plan would require all 30 teams to relocate to Arizona . It would also require the most restrictions and probably cause the most dissension among players.

Players, team personnel and others essential to baseball’s operation (such as umpires and broadcasters) would be isolated in hotels. They would travel only to Chase Field, the 10 spring training ballparks in the Phoenix area, and other local ballparks. There would be no room within what’s been termed as the “bubble” for anyone who refuses to follow the strict protocol. Departure from the bubble to attend to a family situation, such as the birth of a child, could require a two-week quarantine upon return.

The plan has raised concern that the frequent testing and protective equipment required for those within the bubble would jeopardize what is available to medical facilities and first responders as well as the general public.

Temperatures routinely over 100 degrees are also cause for concern, or at least discomfort.

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey is receptive to the single-state proposal. So is Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation’s top infectious disease expert.

MLB has considered whether to include the families of players. Doing so would greatly increase the demands for food, supplies and testing, but it might be the only way to persuade some players to participate.

Host teams in Arizona, Texas and Florida

There are two covered MLB stadiums in both Texas and Florida and one in Arizona, as well as multiple spring training and minor league ballparks across all three states. That infrastructure would be utilized in MLB’s three-state plan, which would place teams in hubs.

It is unknown how MLB would place the teams in the states or how it would operate within that setting.

One possibility would be to cluster teams around the two covered stadiums in both Florida and Texas, where the weather is less predictable than in Arizona, and take advantage of the controlled settings there to host doubleheaders on a regular basis.

However, that strategy would likely require an unbalanced approach, such as placing six to eight teams in Texas, 12 to 14 in Florida, and the rest in Arizona.

Two of the country’s quickest-to-reopen states — Texas and Florida — are included in this three-state proposal. So are two states that have tested the fewest number of people: Texas and Arizona, according to the COVID Tracking Project .

We’re six weeks into what should have been the major league baseball season, and we’ll be lucky to see a game anytime in the next six weeks. This is not the time for a return to baseball as we know it.

This is the downtime for creative minds to give baseball an imaginative makeover.

When the major leagues play again, they almost certainly will do so without fans. Do not fret over what you might fear as the joyless spectacle of tens of thousands of empty seats.

Instead, think of it this way: Baseball will be played in a giant television studio.

TV executives could lead the way in reinventing baseball as entertainment, building a bigger audience and inspiring dramatic changes that could outlast the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Even if none of this had happened, you can look at the ratings of baseball and see they are starting to trend downward,” ABC senior vice president Rob Mills said.

“It needs to be freshened up. If we were looking at this as a TV show, we’d say, ‘What can we do to refresh it, to look at it from an entertainment standpoint rather than a sports standpoint?’ ”

Three television executives offered suggestions. We set two priorities: make baseball more fun to watch, and get fans more involved.

The 2020 season promises to be one big baseball laboratory. Try everything. If it doesn’t work, scrap it and move on.

And now … it’s showtime! Let us know what you think of these ideas, and suggest your own.

::

MIKE FLEISS is the creator and producer of “The Bachelor.” He also is a big fan of the Chargers, and of sharing with every viewer the experience of standing on the playing field.

“If there’s no crowd noise, you’ll be able to hear all the trash-talking. You might as well embrace it. Start mic’ing up players, or use directional microphones, so you can hear everything that’s being said. That’s something the audience hasn’t had before. Having been on the field at games, hearing it is really exciting. That’s the thing I think would be the best.

“I would be trying to replace the excitement of the fans screaming and the pulsating cheering with the inside scoop of what it’s really like to be in the game and hear everything that’s being said, and even the stuff on the mound.”

Maybe not everything, at least not in real time. A brief delay would allow producers to select the most compelling dialogue, mute objectionable language, and protect the integrity of the game, particularly because one of the 30 teams has been proven to be a brazen cheater.

“Obviously, in light of the Astros stuff, you’d probably embargo television access for the teams playing, if you didn’t want them to hear discussions between pitchers and catchers.”

Playing for a guest pass

Fleiss is aware that some players, including the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw and Angels’ Mike Trout, have objected to the possibility of a bubble environment, in which they would be isolated from their families. For argument’s sake, let’s leave aside the issue of children and focus on players not seeing their wives or girlfriends, perhaps for months.

“The biggest problem with why sports leagues will never do it is that I don’t think the players will be able to maintain quarantine. These guys are never going to be able to go cold turkey. You’ve got to be able to embrace that truth and make that part of the game.”

Remember, Fleiss is the guy who dreamed up “The Bachelor.”

“What you do is, each game, you load up the stadium with their wives, at a distance from them and at a distance from each other, so there is no quarantine violation. The winning team gets to have their wives tested, and then essentially a conjugal visit.

“You can [film] all the girls. They’re beautiful. They’re in the stands, separated in their own sections or whatever. Those guys are now playing for more than the pride of winning a baseball game. If you go on an eight-game losing streak, that’s not good.”

And the rose

The offering of the rose is a signature element of “The Bachelor.” How about incorporating it into baseball — say, a manager gets a wild card to use any one batter at any one point in the game?

For instance, if the Angels had the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, with the score tied and Jason Castro due up, manager Joe Maddon could play his wild card by handing a rose to Trout so he would bat instead.

So, Fleiss, how about a rose for baseball?

“Reinstate Pete Rose. The final rose, man. There it is.”

SCOTT KAUFER is a television writer and producer. He was an executive producer of “Boston Legal,” a supervising producer of the sports-agent comedy “Arliss,” and a vice president at Warner Bros. Television.

Kaufer believes baseball could excite fans interested in being the only spectator at the ballpark. He proposes that, for each game, the home team would set up a contest or sweepstakes to select a designated fan.

“The home team would pick up, in a virus-safe way, in a hermetically sealed stretch limo or whatever they want, a fan chosen well in advance. He could sit wherever he wanted: luxury box, stadium club, owner’s box, front row, press box, anywhere he wants. He could move.”

One concession stand would be fully stocked, and the fan could come by and grab food or drink whenever he or she wished. The fan would be announced on the public address system, throw out the first pitch, and be listed in the box score: Attendance—1 (Grace Cohen).

The fan would be encouraged — but not forced — to sing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.”

“Baseball purists probably will hope, as I earnestly do, that each day’s designated fan will cowboy up and attempt the song solo. And I know what you’re thinking — the lyrics would need a bit of a tweak. So I would respectfully suggest:

“Take me out to the ballgame,

“Take me out — I’m the crowd!

“Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,

“But they’re free as a matter of fact. ...”

Give the manager two lifelines

Perhaps the fans could help managers make the right on-field decision in games. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)

Baseball marketing folks can hardly finish a sentence without using the words “fan engagement.” For Kaufer, the gold standard of audience engagement shows is “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.”

So, with fans limited to watching from home, let them play along. During a game, each manager would use two of the trademark “Millionaire” lifelines: phone a fan or poll the fans.

When the Dodgers are faced with deciding whether to keep Kershaw in the game or bring in Kenley Jansen, manager Dave Roberts could use one of the lifelines.

Advertisement

“The manager would turn to the camera and say, ‘I’m going to phone a fan’ or ‘I’m going to poll the fans,’ ” Kaufer said.

“If we can tolerate a delay for instant replay, this will be a much shorter delay. You’ll have the manager mic’d so we hear the ringing in the background, the fan being called: ‘Hello, this is Dave Roberts. What do you think?’”

Teams could run contests to designate the fan on the receiving end of the phone-a-fan question each day, and every viewer wanting to participate in a poll could do so instantly on an app.

Advertisement

Fans would have the satisfaction of saying they told the manager just what to do, no matter how it plays out.

“He’s not required to take the advice, just as contestants on ‘Millionaire’ are not required to take the advice,” Kaufer said, “but he is required to make the call.”

ROB MILLS is a senior vice president at ABC, in charge of reality and late-night programming. He does not see why a stadium without fans should look empty to viewers.

“Holograms in the stands could be interesting: a virtual audience,” he said.

If Tupac Shakur could appear at Coachella after his death, imagine the possibilities: Gene Autry cheering his beloved Angels one more time. Sandy Koufax sitting next to Jackie Robinson, watching the Dodgers.

And let fans buy their way into the crowd: Make a donation to coronavirus relief, and your hologram is in the front row.

For all the tweaks baseball has made toward a faster game — limiting mound visits, shaving seconds off commercial breaks, eliminating the four throws in an intentional walk — the average time of game last season was a record high: 3 hours 5 minutes 35 seconds. Mills has seen enough.

“It’s so long,” he said. “If you look at it like a TV show, from an entertainment standpoint, you’d have a timing sheet: Here’s your format, and it’s got to be done in this amount of time.”

Try something radical: The game is over after three hours, period. Better yet: The game is shortened to seven innings, but no matter what, it’s over after two hours. If Shohei Ohtani is on the bench, and the Angels are saving him for a pinch-hit appearance, Maddon wouldn’t want to risk time running out without using him.

“That’s where it gets really interesting. You’re going to manage the game totally different,” Mills said.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has said he would consider extra-inning tiebreakers in the regular season but not in the postseason. Same thing here. Enforce the rule that requires staying in the batter’s box, put in a pitch clock, and thwart stall tactics. Eliminate mound visits, change pitchers from the dugout and eliminate warmup pitches — that’s what the bullpen is for.

“It’s like you were playing speed golf, except this is speed baseball,” Mills said.

Go young. Go TikTok

Even a two-hour game might be too long to capture the attention of youngsters and turn them into fans.

“Obviously, the thing we deal with in TV is short attention span,” Mills said.

Players will make TikToks, the bite-sized videos kids crave. Players will become more likable as they show off their personalities, goofing off with one another, in the clubhouse or between innings.

Advertisement

Better yet, sponsor a contest in which kids can direct players, virtually, in a TikTok video.

“Have kids choreograph something and get it on there. That’s going to give them a vested interest,” Mills said. “Kids could say, ‘I made this dance, and you’re all going to do it in the clubhouse.’ People would love to see that.”

Officer Ismael Tamayo, 44, a 13-year veteran of the LAPD, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in connection with the late-night shooting at the Stoddard Wells Off-Highway Vehicle Area that wounded a colleague.

But the San Bernardino County district attorney’s office on Tuesday filed a lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon against Tamayo, an Ontario resident. The filing identified the victim as Mark Mascareno, 48, a fellow officer in the LAPD’s Newton Division.

According to the D.A.'s charges, Tamayo used a a Glock .40-caliber handgun in the commission of a “serious and violent felony” that resulted in great bodily injury.

Multiple law enforcement sources who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the incident said three officers were camping, shooting their weapons and drinking alcohol in the hours before Mascareno was wounded.

San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies responded to a shooting call about 1 a.m. Sunday and found Mascareno with a gunshot wound to his shoulder. He was airlifted to a hospital.

Tamayo was found nearby in possession of a firearm and taken into custody, authorities said.

The LAPD has initiated an administrative investigation.

Chief Michel Moore told the L.A. Police Commission on Tuesday he was thankful that the wounded officer was out of the hospital.

“I am very disappointed and frustrated by this event,” Moore said, noting that the injury was “serious and life-threatening.”

In addition how the shooting occurred, Moore said he wants to know why the officers were at the campground during the state’s stay-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic. The area appeared to be open to the public, and other campers were nearby, according to a preliminary investigation.

“What led up to this shooting is very important,” the chief said. “I’d like to not just understand the criminality, but what other issues I might have as chief as to how they ended up there to begin with.”

Tamayo’s attorney, Gregory G. Yacoubian, said in an email his client is cooperating with authorities.

“We are confident that he will be cleared of any wrongdoing once the facts are made known. We ask that due process be allowed to run its course and that the privacy of Ismael and his family is respected,” Yacoubian said.

“It is important that you know that Ismael Tamayo served honorably for over 21 years with the United States military, which included several deployments overseas, and is presently a tenured Los Angeles Police Officer.”

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan ruled after hearing arguments a day earlier as lawyers for withdrawn presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang argued that it was wrong to cancel the primary.

The judge said there was enough time before the primary occurs to figure out how to carry it out safely.

“If all but one of the presidential candidates are removed from the ballot and the primary is not held, Delegate Plaintiffs will be deprived of the opportunity to compete for delegate slots and shape the course of events at the Convention, and voters will lose the chance to express their support for delegates who share their views, the judge wrote. “The loss of these First Amendment rights is a heavy hardship.”

She added: “There is also a strong public interest in permitting the presidential primary to proceed with the full roster of qualified candidates.”

The Democratic members of the State’s Board of Elections voted to cancel the primary even though New York was still planning to hold its congressional and state-level primaries June 23.

They cited the danger to voters from the coronavirus as a reason to cancel the election since former Vice President Joe Biden has been endorsed by the major candidates he had faced.

New York state Democratic party chair Jay Jacobs said: “We are reviewing it.”

Jacobs had called holding the primary “unnecessary” with the suspension of Sanders’ campaign and said reduced turnout could reduce the need for as many poll workers.

"['Bloomberg Delivers Business', 'Financial Information', 'News', 'Insight Around The World.']",2020-05-05  ,Airbnb is cutting 25% of staff amid worldwide travel slump,"Airbnb Inc. is cutting 25% of its workforce as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pummel the travel sector.

About 1,900 Airbnb employees worldwide will be affected, Chief Executive Brian Chesky wrote in an email to staff Tuesday. Those employees’ last day will be Monday, the email said.

“We are collectively living through the most harrowing crisis of our lifetime, and as it began to unfold, global travel came to a standstill,” Chesky wrote. “Airbnb’s business has been hit hard, with revenue this year forecasted to be less than half of what we earned in 2019.”

The San Francisco startup, which was poised to be the blockbuster stock listing of the year, has raised $2 billion in capital and dramatically cut costs in a bid to weather the slump.

“While we know Airbnb’s business will fully recover, the changes it will undergo are not temporary or short-lived,” Chesky wrote. “Because of this, we need to make more fundamental changes to Airbnb by reducing the size of our workforce around a more focused business strategy.”

As a result, Airbnb will pause its efforts in transportation and scale back its investments in hotels and luxury travel, he said.

In an interview with Bloomberg in March, Chesky said the situation has weighed on him. “I’m not sure if there’s a more difficult thing that a CEO of a travel company could ever do than go through this,” he said. “You feel like you were T-boned, or like a torpedo has just hit the ship.”

Before the pandemic, Airbnb’s expenses had already been growing. In 2019, expenses exceeded $5 billion as the company sank money into new offerings aimed at increasing revenue before its highly anticipated initial public offering. The coronavirus outbreak has put Airbnb’s market debut in jeopardy.

Chesky is betting that in the post-pandemic world, travelers will want options that are closer to home, safer and more affordable.

“When we started Airbnb, it was about belonging and connection,” he wrote in the email. “This crisis has sharpened our focus to get ​back to our roots, back to the basics.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-05/airbnb-layoffs-cutting-25-of-staff-travel-slump

Elon Musk just revealed on Twitter the futuristic name and first photos of his new baby boy with Canadian musician Grimes. She gave birth on Monday, and the SpaceX chief executive said that “Mom & baby all good.”

In one tweet, Musk, who’s known for his prolific and sometimes inflammatory opinions on social media, presented a heavily edited image of the newborn, swaddled in cloth, fast asleep and covered in face tattoos. A snake illustration and the word “SAVAGE” were among X Æ A-12’s Instagram-filtered body art. (No, we don’t know how to pronounce the baby’s name either.)

“Never too young for some ink haha,” the Tesla mastermind joked in the replies.

A more traditional photo featured Musk, 48, in an “Occupy Mars” T-shirt cradling the tiny human in one arm while holding a medical mask in the opposite hand.

Earlier this year, Grimes, 32, casually announced on Instagram that she was seven months pregnant while unveiling her new digital avatar, WarNymph, and album “Miss Anthropocene.” Grimes later confirmed Musk was the father in a Rolling Stone profile.

The two have been romantically linked since they walked the “heavenly bodies”-themed carpet together at the 2018 Met Gala.

Grimes’ pregnancy news had spurred a flurry of speculation on social media as to what the experimental pop artist and her tech mogul boyfriend would name their child.

In a sprawling February cover interview with the Face magazine, Grimes admitted that some of the snarky suggestions — including obscure computer codes and “ERROR404"" alerts — were “on point.”

At the time, the performer explained the decision to create a virtual stand-in for herself so that she could be in two places at once as a working, expectant mother.

“Having a digital body allows me to keep working throughout the later stages of my pregnancy, and after I have my baby, so I can spend more time with them,” Grimes said. “It’s hard for me to do photo shoots and fit into clothes at the moment, but WarNymph is here in your magazine promoting my album for me ...

“Like most high school/college seniors, I’m saddened by the loss of milestone events, prom & graduation. In an unprecedented time, it would give us great comfort to hear your voice,” he tweeted at Barack Obama, to the tune of 225,000 likes and more than 46,000 retweets.

Lincoln, who will study political science at Cal State L.A. in the fall, does not know if the Obamas’ decision to hold commencement events is directly tied to his original request. After his tweet went viral, CNN reported that the Obamas’ spokeswoman said the couple was aware of it and “very flattered.”

Lincoln awoke to an exciting surprise when his mother, Caissie St. Onge, burst into his bedroom at 9:30 Tuesday morning, waving her cellphone with the news.

"['Staff Writer', 'Randall Roberts Is A Staff Writer Covering Music', 'Pens The Weekly California Sounds Column For The Los Angeles Times.']",2020-05-05  ,"Historic Troubadour nightclub launches GoFundMe page, calls survival ‘a big if’","For 60 years, the historic club the Troubadour has anchored the western edge of West Hollywood with live music. A perennial presence in Los Angeles live music since the beatnik era, the club opened by Doug Weston has provided thousands of artists the opportunity to make magic on hallowed ground.

But as Gov. Gavin Newsom was recently laying out the stages by which businesses may be able to re-open, Christine Karayan, the club’s general manager, realized the seeming futility of the Troubadour’s plight. Newsom has announced that music venues will be among the last to open, in Phase 4.

“That means the middle to the end of next year to potentially open, and maybe a 25% cap” on crowd size, Karayan says. “I can’t foresee being able to ride this out like that.”

Advertisement

A rustic general admission room with a small balcony and an upstairs VIP area, the 500-capacity club’s selling point has long been its intimacy. Save a few pesky support beams, there’s not a bad spot in the place. A folk and blues venue to start, in the mid-1960s it started adding rock, jazz and pop acts that included rising artists such as the Byrds, Lee Hazlewood, Nina Simone and Judy Collins. It served as a crucial early comedy platform for Richard Pryor, Steve Martin and the Smothers Brothers.

Though it’s a tourist destination, its location just south of the Sunset Strip has made it a kind of neighborhood spot for musically minded Hollywood Hills, Beverly Hills and Hollywood residents.

Starting in the late ‘60s, the Troubadour helped guide artists including Joni Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Tom Waits, the Eagles and Warren Zevon into the mainstream. Most famously, it was on the Troubadour’s stage in 1970 that a 20-year-old Elton John, across a series of shows, became a household name. That moment was captured in the recent John biopic, “Rocketman.”

“My whole life came alive that night, musically, emotionally... everything,” Elton John told The Times a few decades after those auspicious performances. “It was like everything I had been waiting for suddenly happened.... I could tell it was a magical night from the moment I stepped onstage.”

In the decades since, the Troubadour has remained defiantly independent. As other clubs shuttered or made booking arrangements with moneyed promoters such as Live Nation and AEG, the Troubadour has charted its own course — and continued booking standing-room-only gigs. “My last four talent buyers, actually, have all gone to Live Nation,” Karayan says with a fatalistic chuckle. “I’m the training ground, apparently.”

Advertisement

Outsiders commonly think of the Troubadour as a folk and singer-songwriter venue, but across the decades it has adapted and evolved. In the ‘80s, as heavy metal ripped through Southern California, the Troubadour served as a stage for early gigs by Slayer, Metallica and Motley Crue. In the 1990s and ‘00s, the club hosted Brit pop, grunge and alt-rock: Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age, Melvins, Dave Matthews, the White Stripes, Bon Iver and Weezer all played beneath the club’s iconic neon sign on their ascents to main stages.

The Troubadour brand in Los Angeles is so embedded into music culture that many fans misunderstand the mechanics of the club, Karayan says. Describing it as “a little bit forgotten,” Karayan says, “We’re lumped in with the big boys, and we’re not the big boys. We don’t have shareholders. We don’t have corporate money. We are what we are.”

Karayan’s father, Ed Karayan, owns both the club and the building that it’s housed in. He’s been sole caretaker since his former business partner Weston died in 1999. The club leases neighboring offices and storage space at market value, and insurance premiums are exorbitant.

Listing the costs, Karayan pauses. “The more I think about it, it’s just completely futile. At least a big seated venue has space where they can keep people apart. But I don’t know how that works for a general admission venue. Are you going to stop them from using the restroom?”

Like most proprietors, at first Karayan figured that the pandemic would prompt some temporary belt-tightening. She remembers her mind set: “At first, it was, ‘What is happening?’ And then we started canceling shows.”

The last gig was Glass Animals on March 11. YouTube videos show the band’s singer, Dave Bayley, singing from up in the balcony before moving his way through the VIP area and back onto stage. The place was packed. The next day, doom set in, Karayan says. “When we walked into the office on March 12, I thought, ‘Something horribly wrong is coming our way.’” So she decided to cancel shows through May. “And then it just started unraveling.”

When she read a month ago that Live Nation and AEG were predicting a fall 2020 reopening, Karayan was relieved. “I was like, ‘We can do that. We probably won’t have concerts until the end of the year, but it’s OK.” But, she adds, “Now it’s like, ‘Oh, I’m sorry. We’re talking, potentially, the middle of next year.’”

As an active member of the National Independent Venue Assn., she’s communicating with its 800 affiliates about lobbying for government aid. She says that many have expressed doubt that they’ll be able to survive an extended closure without immediate help.

Like many businesses, the Troubadour set up a GoFundMe page to help its 20 hourly employees, some of whom have worked at the club for decades, meet their needs. All but three have been laid off. To date, the campaign has raised $11,400 of its $30,000 goal. But that was a stopgap measure, and Karayan said the club will soon be raising its goal to underscore the urgency. It’s one of the only remaining options.

“It looks tacky, but it’s a reality at this point. It’s not a joke,” she says. “If we’re going to survive this thing — and that’s a big if — we’re going to need all the help we can get, from any direction we can get it.”

Whether that aid comes from one of the many multi-millionaires who owe their fortunes, in part, to momentous gigs at the Troubadour, or through the thousands of fans with once-in-a-lifetime memories, response to the Troubadour’s ask will likely determine whether that Glass Animals gig was the last show at the club.

“We know there’s going to be a huge fatality rate as far as how many venues will not be able to open again when/if this thing ever ends,” Karayan has concluded. “We’re just looking to survive, like everybody else.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-05-05/troubadour-nightclub-west-hollywood-elton-john-coronavirus

About a week after Chris Cuomo announced he finally tested negative for COVID-19, his 14-year-old son, Mario, has also recovered from the respiratory illness, according to an Instagram update from the CNN anchor’s wife, Cristina Cuomo.

“All you need is [love],” the wellness blogger posted Tuesday along with a photo of her kids. “Mario healed, Bella + Carolina stayed safe and I am so grateful for the the silver lining—more family time, to have antibodies and be able to donate.”

Last month, Chris Cuomo said on his CNN show, “Prime Time,” that Mario was the third in their family to contract the virus after both he and Cristina Cuomo had already fallen ill. The newscaster became the first in his household to test positive in late March.

“The virus worked through the family,” he said on CNN of his son’s condition. “It was me and Cristina, and now Mario has the same symptoms she had, and he’s got the coronavirus.”

Cristina Cuomo previously revealed her son’s diagnosis in an Earth Day Instagram post, saying, “My heart hurts more than my head over his infection.”

“This virus does not discriminate,” she added. “While kids are more resilient, they can suffer same severity of symptoms.”

Throughout their coronavirus journey, the parents have been sharing frequent updates via “Prime Time” and Purist, where Cristina Cuomo recently championed a questionable treatment approach: bathing in a Clorox-water solution. (To be clear: Clorox states on its own website that “using a bleach and water solution for bathing is not approved by the EPA and should not be done.”)

Times film critic Justin Chang sat down with entertainment columnist Glenn Whipp to discuss the dominant performance of the 2012 Disney/Marvel blockbuster and where it fits amid the overall glut of superhero movies.

Remember to tune in to their conversation 6 p.m. Thursday livestreamed on the L.A. Times Classic Hollywood Facebook Page and YouTube as well as Twitter. Be sure to watch (or rewatch) “The Avengers” in advance. It is available to stream on Prime Video, Disney+ and most VOD platforms.

And please vote in this week’s poll on Twitter (@justincchang) to select next week’s movie.

JUSTIN CHANG: There’s a scene in “The Avengers” in which Loki, the power-mad Asgardian villain played by Tom Hiddleston, sneers at a crowd of kneeling people and declares, “You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.” I’m hardly the first one to watch that scene and think about how Loki’s words might apply to the intensity and seeming ubiquity of Disney/Marvel fandom. More than most Hollywood blockbusters, “The Avengers” and its 22 siblings in the Marvel Cinematic Universe were made in a spirit of all-out conquest. They were built for worldwide domination, and they’ve succeeded to a degree that can be awe-inspiring, and more than a little depressing, to think about.

I thought about Loki’s words again as I watched “The Avengers” close in on victory in the first week of our #UltimateSummerMovie Showdown. Glenn, I know you can relate: How cool would it have been if another picture from our designated May 1-7 release window — like the sharp political comedy “Dave” or the glorious “Much Ado About Nothing,” both of which opened in theaters May 7, 1993 — had come out on top instead? Or, if we had to have a comic-book superhero movie, couldn’t it have been Sam Raimi’s ebullient “Spider-Man” (2002), which went head-to-masked-head with “The Avengers” in the final round and briefly looked as though it might prevail?

It wasn’t to be. “The Avengers” is our winner, and it is the winner I expected when I finalized the 16 movies set to compete last week. This was always going to be Marvel’s week; the MCU loves releasing movies in early May, and our Twitter polls showed a lot of voter support for franchise favorites “Iron Man” (2008) and “Captain America: Civil War” (2016). It was only fitting that they’d be swallowed up in the end by “The Avengers,” the movie that brought those beloved superhero characters and others together for the first time.

And it is not, I should add, an unworthy winner — although The Times readers who voted it the most overrated film of 2012 in an online survey might beg to differ. I certainly enjoyed “The Avengers” the first time I saw it. After the bland likes of “Thor” and “Captain America: The First Avenger,” it really did feel like an inspired synthesis, a clean-burning entertainment engine that I described in my Variety review as “buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining” and “a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts.” I pretty much stand by those assertions, though not unreservedly. Watching Joss Whedon’s movie again, eight years and 17 MCU movies later, it’s hard not to see it through the prism of superhero fatigue or to wish that its smooth, machine-tooled professionalism had a more human touch. I can tip my hat to the achievement, to be sure, but kneeling is out of the question.

GLENN WHIPP: You mention “superhero fatigue,” Justin, and at the risk of inspiring HULK SMASH collective rage from MCU zealots here, I should admit by the time “Avengers: Infinity War” rolled out, I was watching these films on the back of airplane seats. I do not wear this as a badge of honor, just an honest admission that toward the end of watching the 23 Marvel movies that comprise what’s known as “The Infinity Saga,” along with Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy, plus those (mostly horrible) DC Comics movies (“Wonder Woman” excepted), the “X-Men” series and so on and so forth, the thrill was gone, baby.

If the Marvel movies are, as Martin Scorsese observed, more akin to theme parks than cinema, then I was starting to feel like I was coming to the end of an all-day visit to Disneyland in the middle of July and, in my exhausted mind, the Happiest Place on Earth is the tram returning me to the parking structure.

But it’s been a year since I’ve seen a Marvel movie. And … I … kind … of … miss … them? Not Hawkeye. Not adolescent Groot. But I was looking forward to seeing Chloé Zhao’s vision for “The Eternals” and the long-awaited “Black Widow” standalone movie, directed by Cate Shortland. The best way to combat our collective exhaustion with superhero movies is to hire interesting directors. Props to Marvel for doing just that.

Rewatching “The Avengers” over the weekend, I tried to use one of those Neuralyzers from “Men in Black” — I’m probably tearing a hole in the fabric of the cosmos by crossing cinematic universes here — and erase my memories of those subsequent 17 Marvel movies and just focus on “The Avengers” and the prior entries. And don’t come at me and say if I used a Neuralyzer I wouldn’t remember anything. That’s like saying the Hulk cannot be both a raging, uncontrollable monster and a rational, focused team player when, as we see (quite improbably) in “The Avengers,” he can be both when it suits the storytelling.

What I appreciate most about “The Avengers” is that smooth way it checks off all the boxes, seamlessly integrating multiple characters, giving most of them something interesting to do and delivering a fun spectacle you can take seriously — or not — depending on your reverence for the material. It’s easy now to take that competence for granted. However, you need only look at the graveyard of failed blockbusters (“Battleship” was supposed to be that summer’s other big hit) to understand how this movie could have easily crashed and burned. I’m never bending the knee. But I’m OK being subjugated for a couple of hours if I’m in good hands.

CHANG: I think you’ve nailed the point quite elegantly, Glenn, and also the problem. I suspect we feel more or less the same way about “The Avengers” and could probably argue either position depending on the day. I could easily take the more generous view of the movie’s undeniable virtues — the superb casting, the dexterity of the plotting, the adroit balance of humor, action and exposition — while you stubbornly pointed out some of the deficits, namely the fact that even the most expertly tooled and polished machine is still, at the end of the day, a machine. It’s true that it’s easy to take competence for granted. As the largely unquestioning Marvel-loving masses have made more than clear, it’s also very easy to settle for it.

I’m not saying I prefer “Battleship” (confession: I never saw “Battleship”). But I do think beneath the super-slick banter and the bloodless, oddly unmemorable action scenes, there is something soulless and even antiseptic about the Marvel enterprise. The silky smoothness of these movies is what you get after you’ve ironed out every last kink, every possible threat of darkness and eccentricity, anything that might reek of too much style or interfere with MCU brand imperatives. There have been welcome exceptions, of course: the trippy visuals of “Doctor Strange,” the goofy alien constituents of “Guardians of the Galaxy” and above all the genuine grandeur and political depth of “Black Panther.” But they are very much exceptions to an otherwise depressingly inflexible rule.

But enough grousing from me. It may be damning these movies with faint praise to say that most of them have been pretty good, but “The Avengers” is pretty good — and sometimes a bit better than that. The actors could hardly be better: Robert Downey Jr. may deserve a richer signature role than Tony Stark, but his sandpaper-dry wisecracks are never not enjoyable. The Chrises (Evans and Hemsworth) are first-rate too. If I can borrow your Neuralyzer, Glenn, it is fun to try and forget all the subsequent Sturm und Drang and just watch these guys meet up, hang out and kick each other around for the first time. Also, Hiddleston is just so deliciously smackable as Loki and the incredible moment when he gets his ass handed to him by the Hulk remains, for me, the movie’s endlessly replayable high point.

Speaking of Hulk: The gravity of Mark Ruffalo’s performance as Dr. Bruce Banner really lingered this time around. He’s always been one of this series’ underexposed bright spots; his sly, bookish diffidence is the perfect counterweight to his alter ego’s uncontrollable rage. It’s telling, I think, that the Hulk has been such a logistically problematic, hard-to-sustain figure in the Marvel cosmos, as evidenced by his two previous solo outings (in which he was played by Eric Bana and Edward Norton). Starting with Ruffalo in “The Avengers,” they not only got the right man but also figured out how to use him — with short, well-timed bursts of destructive mayhem and comic relief. I wish they’d use him more, frankly; a loss of control might have done this rigorously managed franchise some good.

WHIPP: It’s not entirely bloodless, Justin. Or have you forgotten those blood-stained Captain America trading cards that Nick Fury removed (not really) from the corpse of the dearly departed Agent Coulson? Or perhaps you did, as his death wasn’t quite the gut punch it should have been. Coulson was the moral compass of the whole operation. Plus, he had Loki pegged better than anybody. “You lack conviction,” Coulson tells him, shortly before getting off one last blast. Of course, death being a loose construct in the MCU, it’s not the last we’ll see of Coulson. I just hope the Avengers mourned him in the moment. He deserves a shawarma sandwich named in his honor.

At this point, 23 movies in, it would take something stronger than a Neuralyzer to erase what you astutely called “Marvel brand imperatives,” Justin. Proficient plotting can also be seen (and, more importantly, felt) as bland programming, leading to a series of films that often boast sparkling continuity at the expense of thrilling imagination.

But we didn’t know what was to come when “The Avengers” arrived eight years ago, so I still can appreciate its small touches of weirdness — Hiddleston’s “full-tilt diva” turn as Loki, the way Coulson gets all starstruck when he’s around Captain America, Pepper Potts padding around in her bare feet because A) smart women don’t need heels or B) Gwyneth Paltrow has a couple of inches on Downey and Iron Man cannot be seen being dwarfed by a member of the opposite sex.

Really though, any movie featuring the late Harry Dean Stanton is OK by me, even if he has a just a cameo and even if his casting, according to Whedon, was purely accidental as cinematographer Seamus McGarvey happened to be shooting a documentary about the actor. That happy accident does prove your point, though, Justin. Moments of invention can sometimes provide the most lasting joys.

This week ‘Bridesmaids’ and 15 more compete,"Welcome to the second week of the L.A. Times #UltimateSummerMovie Showdown, our 16-week contest to program the greatest summer movie season ever. Or at least since 1975, the year that “Jaws” forever changed the landscape of moviemaking, gross tallying and beach bumming forever.

To recap the rules: Each week, I will present you with a list of 16 movies from 1975 to 2019, all of which were released during a particular summer time frame. Last week, the contenders included such May 1-7 releases as “Sixteen Candles” (1984), “Dave” (1993), “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery” (1997) and “Spider-Man” (2002).

The winner of that superhero-heavy bout — triumphing over fellow Marvel franchise installments “Iron Man” (2008) and “Captain America: Civil War” (2016) — was “The Avengers” (2012). At 6 p.m. Pacific on Thursday, my Times colleague Glenn Whipp and I will be co-hosting a live chat on “The Avengers” that will be streamed on the Los Angeles Times Classic Hollywood Facebook Page and YouTube as well as Twitter. The movie is available to watch in advance on Prime Video, Disney+ and most VOD platforms.

There are no Marvel movies in contention this week, which covers movies that opened in U.S. theaters between May 8-14 , 1975-2019. But there are some excellent movies, and even the also-rans commanded passionate support among The Times colleagues who helped me hash out the list. Here are the films, in chronological order:

Advertisement

“Friday the 13th” (1980)

It may have been a slipshod “Halloween” ripoff, but it was also ruthlessly effective enough to launch one of the most iconic (and endless) slasher franchises in movie history.

“Conan the Barbarian” (1982)

Two years before “Terminator,” John Milius’ sword-and-sorcery beefcake extravaganza propelled that Nietzschean super-warrior Arnold Schwarzenegger to global stardom.

“Blue Thunder” (1983)

Its politics may be as dated as its technology, but the thrill of Roy Scheider and Malcolm McDowell going head-to-head in helicopters never gets old.

“The Natural” (1984)

“Primordial hokum,” Pauline Kael called it. And like a lot of hokum, Barry Levinson’s lacquered ode to the majesty of baseball — and Robert Redford — is still hard to resist.

Advertisement

“Short Circuit” (1986)

After “Blue Thunder,” this runaway-robot comedy is the second John Badham-directed movie about government technology run amok on this week’s list. I haven’t seen it since childhood, but if it gets far enough in the voting, I’m curious to see how it holds up.

“The Crow” (1994)

Forever linked to the accidental death of its star, Brandon Lee, during filming, Alex Proyas’ comic-book adaptation endures as a work of feverish visual imagination.

“Crimson Tide” (1995)

Tony Scott’s submarine thriller pitting a cool Denzel Washington against a barking Gene Hackman arrives drenched in testosterone, warmed-over Cold War paranoia and the best faux clammy-Clancy atmosphere money can buy.

“Twister” (1996)

Helen Hunt and the late Bill Paxton starred in this gargantuan hit that put the “fun” in “funnel.” Be sure and catch its recently released spiritual prequel, “First Cow.”

“The Fifth Element” (1997)

It’s got a blond Bruce Willis. It’s got an orange-haired Milla Jovovich. It’s got flying cars, whizzing bullets and an engorged fireball of death. It’s got damn near everything you might want in a movie and a hell of a lot you don’t.

“Deep Impact” (1998)

Speaking of engorged fireballs of death: This is the first and more sensitively drawn of the two summer-of-1998 thrillers about an enormous chunk of matter on a collision course with Earth (the other being, of course, “Armageddon”). Téa Leoni and Maximilian Schell’s last scene still gets to me.

“Unfaithful” (2002)

Adrian Lyne’s steamy, moralistic potboiler is never as smart or emotionally sophisticated as Diane Lane’s blazingly good performance, but she made it something to see and sometimes swoon over.

“Speed Racer” (2008)

A critical and commercial disappointment for the Wachowskis on initial release, this riotous blur of color and kinetic energy has only grown in cult stature over the years.

Advertisement

“Star Trek” (2009)

Led by a superbly matched Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, it’s the rare movie to turn a financial imperative (a reboot!) into an ingenious narrative loophole. It also remains, by light years, the best “Star” movie of any kind that J.J. Abrams has directed.

“Bridesmaids” (2011)

It was explosively funny, yes. Thanks to star Kristen Wiig (who wrote the script with Annie Mumolo), it was also a perceptive, emotionally lacerating portrait of friendship, class envy and midlife disappointment.

“The Great Gatsby” (2013)

In Baz Luhrmann’s very busy hands, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic became a gaudy carnival of maximalist kitsch. Love it or hate it (and I’m right in the middle), Leonardo DiCaprio remains a Jay Gatsby for the ages.

“Neighbors” (2014)

Nicholas Stoller’s sharp, raucous comedy of intergenerational warfare has Seth Rogen and Zac Efron giving it their all, but Rose Byrne is its secret weapon. (Between this and “Bridesmaids,” it’s clearly her week.)

Advertisement

The also-rans: Among the May 8-14 releases that narrowly missed our list were “A Knight’s Tale” (2001), the medieval-goblet-of-rock fantasy starring Heath Ledger, and “28 Weeks Later” (2007), an underappreciated sequel to “28 Days Later” and a terrific pandemic movie to boot.

I did that thing that people talk about: I was watching [New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s] broadcast. I just picked up a bag and I threw a couple clothes in it. I drove to the airport, and I just bought a ticket. I mean, I had a mask and I had, like, all this hand sanitizer... I have days where it’s so incredible I get to spend this time with these people I really care about, and then I have days where I’m like, “I just want to go to a coffee shop, and I want someone to come over and hug me.” So it’s this weird mixture. I have great days and I have horrible days.

While production of Season 4 of “Stranger Things” is on hold for now, we caught up with Harbour to discuss what his character, gruff small-town police chief Jim Hopper, would do in quarantine; the lie he told Aaron Sorkin while working on “The Newsroom”; and connecting with the Duffer brothers to plan the future of Netflix’s sci-fi/horror hit.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.', 'Jill Lawless']",2020-05-04  ,Prince Harry and Meghan to tell ‘real’ story in new book,"Freed from the constraints of life as full-time royals — and enmeshed in a feud with Britain’s tabloid press — Prince Harry and his wife Meghan plan to tell their story in a book penned by sympathetic journalists.

Harper Collins U.K. announced Monday that it will publish “Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family” in Britain and the Commonwealth on Aug. 11. The book will be published in the U.S. the same day by HarperCollins-owned Dey Street Books.

The book is written by Harper’s Bazaar royal editor Omid Scobie and Elle magazine royal correspondent Carolyn Durand, who said they aim to capture “the real Harry and Meghan” and “finally present the truth of misreported stories” about them.

The publisher said the book will tackle “the many rumors and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond.” It says the authors have been given “unique access” and the cooperation of those closest to the couple.

The announcement comes two weeks after Harry and Meghan said they would no longer cooperate with several British tabloid newspapers because of what they called “distorted, false or invasive” stories.

Meghan is suing publisher Associated Newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over a series of articles in the Mail on Sunday that reproduced parts of a letter she wrote to her father, Thomas Markle.

Harry, who is a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and sixth in line to the British throne, married the American actress Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle in May 2018, in a lavish ceremony watched around the world.

The couple later said they found the scrutiny they received from the British media intolerable and claimed it tipped into harassment.

In January, they announced they planned to step back as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America.

Ching, and his counterpart, Ling, are racial caricatures — two Chinese gamblers imprisoned for cheating passengers out of their money. I accepted the role because I was a geeky freshman flattered by the attention and eager to make friends.

And so for three nights and dozens of rehearsals, I donned a red silk robe, spoke in a feigned Chinese accent and portrayed my people as America has always seen them — as an untrustworthy, exotic punchline.

I feel a lot of shame about that memory, and I’ve never really talked about it. I was worried by what other Asian Americans might think of me, and most of the time I just try to forget that it even happened. I’ve covered Asian American communities for nearly a decade now, and I’ve tried to make my career as a journalist about the opposite of what I did on that stage.

But I’ve been talking about this memory a lot recently, and about a lot of others like it, because we’ve been working on a podcast at the Los Angeles Times called “Asian Enough,” to be released March 17.

Each week, entertainment reporter Jen Yamato and I interview a different guest about what being Asian American means to them. On every episode, we talk about what Asian Americans are, and aren’t. We name the boxes that America tries to put us in, and together, we encourage one another to reject them.

What we’ve found is that sharing these vulnerabilities can take away their power to hurt us. And talking about them has helped me understand that a lot of Asian Americans have been through a lot of the same things. Though we might be the most disparate racial category in America, comprising dozens of nationalities, languages and cultures, what we have in common are the weird stereotypes that America tries to apply to us.

I’ve come to see being Asian American as not so much an identity as it is a shared sense of racial dislocation. It’s what happens when this country tries to put you in a box. Sometimes you climb in because you crave belonging. Or you reject it, but it haunts you anyway. And sometimes you realize you don’t fit any of the boxes, and you’re left to wonder whether you fit in at all.

When you can’t be Asian enough and you’ll never be American enough to fit into any other racial category, what remains is this nagging feeling of alienation and inadequacy. And you start to blame yourself rather than the impossible quandaries you’re presented with.

So on our podcast, we also talk about our shames and flaws, and try to accept them. It’s a scary conversation to have, but an important one: Psychologists are exploring the possibility of a connection between racial dislocation and mental illness among Asian Americans. Asian Americans may be overrepresented at elite colleges, but once there, they struggle with higher rates of suicide and mental illness.

And so many of my Asian American friends have spoken of not being Asian enough and not being seen as American. If we all feel this way, maybe we’re having the wrong kind of conversation.

Growing up in Tennessee, I thought I could find belonging in trying to be white. I remember saving up my money to buy clothes from Abercrombie & Fitch and begging my mom for a puka shell necklace. I studied “Friends” episodes to try to understand American humor, and rehearsed the jokes, thinking that if I could be seen as a Joey, Chandler or Ross, perhaps I would be more popular or socially interesting.

Moving to California, and spending the last 10 years telling Asian American stories, I’ve found so much belonging in my community. What once brought me shame now fills me with pride.

When I’m out reporting, I no longer find it shameful to hear Asian-accented English — instead, it reminds me of my mother and father talking.

Why, you might ask?

Well, there are a couple of explanations.

“It really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country,” Pence said. “The president stood up the White House coronavirus task force … to marshal a national response.”

“And as I’ve said before,” Pence continued, “as we continue to practice social distancing and states engage in safe and responsible reopening plans, I truly believe — and the trend lines support it — that we could be in a very different place” by late May or early June.

Fantastic. Except for those other reports that government predictions suggest 3,000 deaths per day by June, a 70% increase over the current daily tally, and a separate analysis suggesting the number of COVID-19 deaths nationwide could double to 135,000 by August. That comes as states — including California — begin loosening restrictions.

Then there’s the political explanation.

By closing down the task force, the White House would shift the visible responsibility for the fight against the coronavirus from the president to federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (led by Dr. Anthony Fauci) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as to state governments and elected officials.

Doing so would position Trump to head into the summer — and the early scale-up of the fall election cycle — not as the near-daily host of the coronavirus task force update briefings, but as the president who handed off the problem to federal agencies.

He could then claim success if the pandemic does indeed die down, or run against those very agencies if the pandemic worsens or stages a rebound in the fall, as some experts suspect will happen.

He could then try to claim that he had the problem under control and the rest of the government messed it up. Yes, Trump is trying to angle himself to turn the coronavirus to his political advantage (nothing new there).

That would put Trump in his favorite role — as the aggrieved victim of the “deep state,” the entrenched government establishment and the “hostile press,” which in his view (or in his cynical lie to his base supporters) is in cahoots with Democrats to stifle the revolution he has been leading, and which stands in the way of his mission to “keep America great.”

That would give our dishonest president a platform from which to claim he needs to be reelected — to finish the job hardworking (and sometimes xenophobic) Americans sent him there to do. Namely, blow it all up ... er, drain the swamp.

But what, you ask, of the health and the security of the American people?

Two terrible months of quarantining at home, staying six feet from other people, washing your hands raw, avoiding social gatherings and wearing face coverings outside (sometimes, at least) have paid off.

Coronavirus infections and COVID-19 deaths have been kept in check in the most populous state. Better yet, hospitalizations for people sickened by COVID-19 appear to have started going down from last week’s peak.

California’s current totals — 54,937 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,254 deaths — may sound bad, but some public health experts had expected things to be much, much worse at this point. Instead, hospitals haven’t been overrun with sick people. Bodies weren’t stacked up in trucks. And now, after weeks of furious efforts to increase capacity, testing is up to 30,000 people a day statewide. The state has 24 million medical-grade face masks for healthcare providers. More than 10,000 ventilators are sitting idle, and there are 2,072 empty hospital beds.

These are more than just encouraging statistics. Together they mark an important inflection point for the state. California finally begins to reopen this week, albeit slowly and carefully. And it’s vital that we not move faster than it’s safe to go.

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Monday that conditions have been met for the state to move into the second of four stages he had outlined for responding to the pandemic. (The first stage was shutting things down.) This means that as soon as Friday, many retail stores and manufacturing sites that the government had labeled nonessential in the first stage can start to reopen to customers, albeit without reopening their doors to them. Instead, they’ll have to limit their interactions to curbside pickup. Later this month, offices may be allowed to open as well, provided they have configured workspaces to curb transmission of the virus.

This is a moment to celebrate, to be sure. But in a socially distanced way. The worst thing would be for this news to lull anyone into thinking COVID-19 is on the run, and it’s time to party like it’s 2019. The pandemic is still raging globally, and hundreds of Americans are still dying every day. Although the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the experimental drug remdesivir raises hopes for a new treatment for COVID-19 patients, there’s only a limited supply of the medication. It will be months before there are enough doses for everyone who needs it, and remdesivir may not be the answer for patients with highly advanced cases. Meanwhile, a vaccine is still a year, or even years, away, assuming it’s even possible to make a safe and effective one.

For many places, the worst is yet to come. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now projects that deaths from COVID-19 in the United States could more than double by June to 3,000 a day, due in large part to premature lifting of social distancing rules in other states. If that happens here, the governor said, we will have to return to more restrictions.

Nobody wants to go back, which makes it imperative that Californians continue observing social distancing and protective measures, such as wearing face coverings in public places and not gathering in large numbers. We know it works, and it’s the only way to reach the important next stage, when most of us will be cleared to go back to work, assuming there’s a job to go to.

Advertisement

Newsom also said Monday that he would be allowing some regions, such as rural counties that have seen relatively few cases of COVID-19, to lift pandemic restrictions more quickly — so long as they can demonstrate that they’re adhering to the guidelines set by the state’s public health officers. Presumably, this is in reaction to the rebellions in recent days in enclaves such as Modoc County, which defied the state’s stay-at-home order by allowing businesses to reopen this week if they took certain safety measures.

Modoc is one of four California counties that has not logged a single coronavirus case, and it makes sense to allow all of them to restart their economies at a faster pace, though with restrictions on large group gatherings and other appropriate precautions. The pandemic has largely been a problem for urban areas, and cities such as Los Angeles must continue to observe pandemic restrictions for the moment.

So, here’s to the first bit of good news in what seems like an endless spring of despair. Let’s do what it takes to make sure it’s not the last one.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-05/editorial-california-is-starting-to-re-open-dont-let-it-backslide
['Jeffrey W. Hornung'],2020-05-05  ,Op-Ed: China’s latest ‘charm offensive’: Using mask diplomacy to divert world attention from its misdeeds,"We’ve seen something like this before. Straight from its well-versed playbook, China has gone on a “charm offensive” to try to make the world forget Beijing’s culpability in the coronavirus crisis. This time, the charm offensive comes in the form of masks and ventilators.

A decade ago, it was common to hear China advocate for its peaceful rise. Regional countries had nothing to worry about, or so the narrative went. That charm offensive turned out to be a ruse. By the mid-2010s, China had embarked on an aggressive maritime campaign against its neighbors. Whether it was employing military and paramilitary assets against Japan in the East China Sea or pursuing large-scale artificial island building in the South China Sea, the peaceful rise narrative proved to be a distraction from Beijing’s true intentions.

Echoes of this behavior can be seen in China’s response to COVID-19 and behavior vis-à-vis its neighbors. Despite China’s denial, there is ample evidence to believe that the coronavirus began in China. Early on, Chinese leadership apparently knew the epidemic was out of control. Worse, it hid the extent of the outbreak from the international community, doing everything in its power to cover up its culpability.

To divert the world’s attention, China has provided coronavirus-related aid to hundreds of countries that include tens of millions of masks, millions of testing kits, and ventilators, including 1,000 for New York. This makes for good news but belies China’s actions against neighbors struggling with the pandemic. In the few short months since COVID-19 began spreading beyond China’s borders, China has continued — and in some cases escalated — provocations against its neighbors, both in the air and maritime domains, to challenge sovereignty claims as these states struggle with the weight of the pandemic.

Advertisement

The U.S. State Department has criticized China for several actions in the South China Sea that include announcing new “research stations” on military bases it built on Fiery Cross Reef and Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands; landing military aircraft on Fiery Cross Reef; and continuing to deploy maritime militia around the islands. From mid-February to mid-March, China also successfully extracted a world record amount of natural gas from the South China Sea. And in early April, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing trawler in the South China Sea.

Farther north, China has been similarly contentious against its neighbors. The country has conducted an aggressive disinformation campaign against Taiwan, and China’s military has been engaging in overtly provocative behavior against the island — making airspace incursions, holding nighttime exercises and sailing naval ships nearby, including an aircraft carrier.

China has also been relentless against Japan around the Senkaku Islands, a set of small islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but claimed by China.

Advertisement

Data show that Chinese vessels entered waters in Japan’s contiguous zone around the Senkaku Islands for most of January, February and March. Chinese ships also went into the Senkaku’s territorial waters several times between January and March. These trends are continuing.

Since China’s neighbors are all struggling to contain and overcome the economic, health and societal problems unleased by COVID-19, China appears to be taking advantage of its neighbors’ distraction, while using simplistic “mask diplomacy” to try to get other nations to forget about Beijing’s role in the pandemic.

China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, has denied the accusation that China is trying to take advantage of its neighbors’ struggles with the pandemic, saying the country “would like to share China’s good practice and experience” but “will not turn it into any kind of geopolitical weapon or tool.”

The denial sounds eerily familiar. In 2016, China’s vice foreign minister, Liu Zhenmin, tried to dissuade Malaysian concerns about China’s charm offensive as nothing more than checkbook diplomacy, saying, “There is no such thing as using our financial muscle to improve ties.”

Countries should not allow themselves to be fooled again. If China were genuinely concerned with other nations during this global pandemic, most observers would expect its behavior to change.

Other countries have hit pause on conflicts to battle their common biological enemy. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates — at war with Yemen’s Houthi rebels — unilaterally declared a cease-fire to help prevent COVID-19 spread in Yemen. Similarly in Libya, both sides in an ongoing conflict agreed to a cease-fire so the country can focus on battling the outbreak. Likewise, in Latin America, the National Liberation Army, a revolutionary left-wing armed group in Colombia, unilaterally declared a cease-fire as a humanitarian gesture to the Colombian people. And in Africa, the Southern Cameroons Defense Forces militia announced it would implement a cease-fire because of the outbreak.

Even in China’s own neighborhood, regional countries are resisting the temptation to leverage COVID-19 as an opportunity for gain. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte unilaterally declared a cease-fire with communist rebels as the government tries to contain the outbreak. The Barisan Revolusi Nasional rebels fighting the Thai government also unilaterally declared that they would halt their activities due to the virus, their first cease-fire in the long-running Thai conflict.

These cease-fires, taken by groups that have often performed horrible acts against their neighbors and their own countrymen, demonstrate how militaries and even rebel groups can put the universal good above their own interests in this time of pandemic spread. What China is doing against its neighbors is anything but that. Even Chinese military experts have admitted as much, saying that recent military drills by the Chinese military showed “it is capable of driving intruders and unfriendly priers away” at a time “COVID-19 has significantly lowered the U.S. Navy’s warship deployment capability in the Asia-Pacific region.”

Don’t let masks and ventilators fool. There is an opportunity to be had, and China appears unlikely to waste it.

['Jonah Goldberg'],2020-05-05  ,Column: The White House plays dumb on the pandemic’s China connection,"The future is particularly murky these days. It’s anybody’s guess how the pandemic, the presidential election and the economy are going to play out. Just about the only thing that’s assured is that U.S. relations with China will never be the same.

Businesses are radically rethinking their supply chains and whether you call the rest of us voters or consumers, attitudes toward China are souring. A recent Harris poll found that two-thirds of Democrats and 9 out of 10 Republicans hold China responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. Already, a slew of lawsuits have been leveled against the Chinese government. The West’s political orientation toward China is shifting too, as countries around the world increasingly point fingers at Beijing.

In short, the issue isn’t whether a China-U.S. reckoning is coming, only whether we’re smart or dumb about it.

Early on, the knee-jerk response from Democrats, the World Health Organization, much of the media and the Chinese government itself, was to claim that any criticism of the Chinese government’s actions was bigoted or xenophobic.

Advertisement

On the merits, this is ridiculous. The Chinese government is a cruel and oppressive regime. Its refusal to be transparent and cooperative with the international community has been outrageous, and it’s not bigoted to say so. But the CCP, the Communist Party of China, is not “the Chinese” or even “China,” and blanket-blaming a whole nation and its people for a pandemic makes no sense. It’s as dumb, in other words, as stipulating that any negative word about Beijing is xenophobic.

The current debate over the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is another excellent example of how dumb we can be about criticizing China. The claim that the virus originated in a Chinese lab is not synonymous with the deranged conspiracy theory that the Chinese created the virus and purposefully unleashed it.

There is no evidence that the virus is man-made; scientists would be able to tell with genetic sequencing. Nor is it plausible that China’s interests would be served by the deliberate release on its own soil. A more credible — but unproven — theory is that the Chinese were studying the virus and it could have been accidentally released. Or it may also have emerged “naturally,” as the Chinese government contends, from a Wuhan meat market.

As the question of where the virus came from has heated up, Republican China hawks, in and out of the administration, rarely volunteer that they don’t mean “man-made” when they say “originated.” And much of the media coverage similarly ignores or downplays this distinction. Some pro-Trump media personalities seem eager to fuel anti-Chinese sentiments while the anti-Trump crowd seem to prefer to see a more mockable conspiracy theory.

Advertisement

This mutually beneficial ambiguity gets a boost from the Trump administration’s vacillation over how much blame it wants to assign to China and how it wants to direct it, all with an eye toward riling up its base and distracting from its early missteps in combating the pandemic.

On the one hand, President Trump values his personal relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and covets a major trade deal with him. Trump is on the record praising Xi’s coronavirus leadership and he remains reluctant to criticize Xi directly. On the other hand, the president and many of his advisors and surrogates relish having a new evil empire to galvanize support around.

(The schizophrenic nature of all this is ironically analogous to conservative criticism of the Trump administration. A slew of pro-Trump politicians and media figures are sharply critical of the administration’s response to the pandemic while simultaneously refusing to criticize Trump. The result is heated talk of states needing to be “liberated” from governors following the president’s guidelines and presidential advisors being scapegoated for presidential decisions.)

The ambiguity about China’s misdeeds was on display during the Sunday talk shows.

When Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo told ABC’s Martha Raddatz that “China has a history of infecting the world,” Raddatz admirably asked, “Do you believe it was man-made or genetically modified?” Pompeo replied, “Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point.” After Raddatz, again admirably, pointed out that the exact opposite is the case, that experts including the U.S. intelligence community believe it is not man-made, Pompeo said, “That’s right, I agree with that.” Then he went on to make a defensible case against the Chinese government, never mentioning Xi by name.

It’s surely possible he merely misspoke. But his dancing back and forth between dumb and smart was at minimum symbolic of an administration that wants to have it both ways.

Anger at Xi’s government is warranted, as is a recalibration of our relationship with China in the long aftermath of the pandemic. But treating a nuclear and economic superpower as an existential enemy primarily to satisfy domestic political needs — during an economic and public health crisis — strikes me as the dumbest way to go.

['Daniel T. Willingham'],2020-05-04  ,Op-Ed: State lockdowns have become politically divisive. Here’s how we can come together,"Americans are in the midst of a moral dilemma as stark as any in the Bible. If we end the lockdown, deaths from COVID-19 will increase, but if we maintain it, the astounding unemployment rate will move still higher.

The problem would be tragic enough, but now it’s become politicized and has further divided Americans. Research on how people think about dire choices may help governors bring us together on this issue.

In one sense, the choice ought to be easy, because preserving life is what psychologists call a “sacred value.” Sacred values are not simply important, they are nonnegotiable — a human life is considered priceless — and people angrily condemn those who say otherwise.

In an experiment testing this value, subjects read about a hospital administrator who had to choose between spending a million dollars either on a life-saving operation for a child or on salary raises to ensure the best doctors stayed at the hospital. Subjects were outraged if the story described the administrator as considering the raises, even if he ultimately made the right choice. Similar outrage was directed at an Antioch, Calif., city planning commissioner last week when he suggested that the elderly and the homeless should be left to die in the pandemic, given that they are a drain on society.

Advertisement

It might seem, then, that Americans will support extreme measures, including an indefinite lockdown, to save lives. But the situation became more complicated when demonstrators in Michigan, California and other states framed the argument to end the coronavirus quarantine as a matter of “liberty” on the logic that each of us has the right to live as we wish, even at the risk of contracting COVID-19. That doubtless strikes some as mere rhetoric, but liberty is, for many Americans, a sacred value. “Give me liberty or give me death!” is invoked with patriotic admiration, not ridicule.

What happens when sacred values — human life and liberty — are pitted against each another?

People usually view a clash of sacred values as tragic. When researchers changed the hospital administrator story so that an organ-donor shortage caused him to have to choose which of two children’s lives to save, subjects felt pathos, not anger. So did Americans when they heard stories of Italian doctors forced to ration life-saving ventilators among extremely ill COVID-19 patients.

Advertisement

Why, then, is the question of when and how to relax the lockdown not evoking pathos, but anger? Partly because defenders of each value claim that the other value is not really threatened. People who want to extend the lockdown aren’t focused on the dire costs of economic downturns, such as increases in substance abuse and suicides; they are ridiculing protesters who are upset they can’t get a haircut.

Likewise, those who want to end the lockdown don’t trivialize the sacred value that’s getting in their way (human life) but instead suggest it’s not threatened; they compare COVID-19 to seasonal influenza, or they suggest that “amazing” medications are at hand.

In addition to belittling the opposing position, we are likely to overlook times we violate our own sacred values. Americans may say they cherish life, yet we do, as a society, tolerate deaths for economic reasons; surely Medicare and the Veteran’s Administration Hospital system could save more lives if they were better funded. We even tolerate deaths to protect trivial pleasures. For example, there’s no law against eating raw oysters, even though the practice kills about 100 people each year.

Likewise, Americans say they love liberty, but they don’t protest the numerous impositions on their freedom meant to protect their safety, including donning a helmet before riding a bicycle or removing shoes to deal with heightened security at airports.

Advertisement

The fact that people trivialize others’ points of view and overlook their own hypocrisy helps explain why people are so angry over the quarantine. But governors won’t bring their constituents together by calling them out for their inconsistencies. What’s a better strategy?

Research shows that when constituencies conflict around sacred values, anger can be reduced if each side shows some willingness to sacrifice. Consider an experiment testing Israeli West Bank settlers and Palestinian students, majorities of whom said they would never negotiate on their sacred values (yielding West Banks lands, and sovereignty over Jerusalem, respectively), even for the sake of peace. Researchers found that suggesting cash settlements as part of a peace deal prompted outrage. But a suggestion that the opposing side would yield on a matter touching their sacred value defused anger and made people more open to negotiation.

Governors can bring Americans together by showing that all values — life, liberty and economic security — matter. To satisfy those who feel their liberty (and the economy) are compromised, governors should redouble their efforts for aggressive testing, so that the quarantine can apply only to those who really need it. To address those concerned about potential loss of life, governors should support vigorous quarantine laws for the sick with actual consequences for violators, as well as the tracking of contacts.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to reopen California in phases, beginning this week, offers a useful model for other states. Localities will have increased authority to set their own pace, but they must demonstrate capacity in testing and contact-tracing to move forward.

Attorneys filed papers Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court to dismiss five lawsuits filed or backed by the Madison Square Garden Co. that opposed the arena project.

The move came the day after Clippers owner Steve Ballmer closed on his $400-million purchase of the Forum from MSG, settling a dispute that started when the Clippers announced their arena project in June 2017.

MSG sued Inglewood and Mayor James T. Butts Jr. over the arena in 2018, alleging the company was tricked into surrendering its lease to use vacant city-owned land for overflow parking at the Forum. That land would be used to make way for the arena project. Murphy’s Bowl LLC, the Clippers-controlled company behind the project, countersued. The bitter litigation included the production of internal emails, text messages and scores of depositions, among them Ballmer, New York Knicks owner and MSG executive chairman James Dolan, and Lakers owner Jeanie Buss.

MSG sued a city-related agency later in 2018 and, earlier this year, sued Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state’s Joint Legislative Budget Committee over legislation that fast-tracked the project.

According to court filings, MSG paid legal fees for a community group called Inglewood Residents Against Takings and Evictions, or IRATE, that filed two lawsuits over the arena.

The group lost the first case, which accused Inglewood of violating state environmental law, but appealed. A second case targeted city-related agencies. Both cases were among those included in the motions to dismiss Tuesday.

The only MLB game played without fans happened five years ago last week. The Baltimore Orioles and Chicago White Sox played at an empty Camden Yards after unrest surfaced in response to Baltimore resident Freddie Gray’s death in police custody.

Riots forced MLB to cancel the first two games of the series. The finale was moved from night to the afternoon to comply with the city’s curfew. The decision was made to not allow fans entry.

The Orioles won, 8-2, in a brisk two hours and three minutes — an unusually short game. Music and the public address announcer echoed. Players pretended to sign autographs. A ball girl did her job, protecting the empty seats behind her. Stadium employees roamed the stands for foul balls.

After the game, Orioles first baseman Chris Davis, who hit a three-run home run in the first inning, compared the atmosphere to a spring training intrasquad game. Orioles manager Buck Showalter said every word could be heard on the field.

“When you’re rounding the base and the only cheers were from outside the stadium, it’s a weird feeling,” Davis told reporters. “I’ll take any home run I can get at any time I can get it, but it’s definitely more fun when there are fans.”

The PGA Tour has held two full rounds without fans present: the third round of the 2012 AT&T National in Maryland and the final round of the 2016 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in San Diego. In both instances, fans weren’t allowed after inclement weather caused damage and toppled trees.

The third round of the AT&T National was played after a windstorm ripped through the area the previous night. The storm left more than 400,000 people and the course without power. The round began after a six-hour delay with the temperature approaching triple digits and debris on the course.

Tiger Woods chipped in for a birdie on the sixth hole, and the shot was met by silence.

“I’ve played in front of people like this, but not generally for an 18-hole competitive round,” Woods said.

Fans were allowed for the final round the next day. They watched Woods shoot a two-under 69 to come from behind for his 74th career win.

Weather caused a more recent example in hockey. On Jan. 17, 2018, the American Hockey League’s Charlotte Checkers hosted the Bridgeport Sound Tigers at Bojangles’ Coliseum. The arena was empty after six inches of ice and snow fell in the Charlotte, N.C., area and the Checkers discouraged fans from attending. The Checkers, an affiliate of the Carolina Hurricanes, won 4-3.

Running back Cam Akers, the Rams’ second-round draft pick, has a broader outlook.

“I’m looking forward to everything, in any way that I can, whether it’s blocking, running, catching, special teams, whatever I need to do,” Akers said last month after the Rams made him the fourth running back selected in the NFL draft. “I got my big-boy pants on and I’m ready to do it.”

Akers rushed for 1,144 yards and scored 18 touchdowns last season for Florida State.

The Rams drafted the 5-foot-10, 217-pound Akers a little more than a month after releasing Gurley, the three-time Pro Bowl selection and the 2017 NFL offensive player of the year whose balky left knee and gigantic contract convinced the Rams he was expendable.

Akers joins a running back corps that includes Gurley’s longtime backup, Malcolm Brown, second-year pro Darrell Henderson and third-year pro John Kelly.

Coach Sean McVay is expected to explore a running back-by-committee approach to make up for the void left by Gurley.

“That’s to be determined based on how things play themselves out,” McVay said when asked how he planned to divvy up carries, “and when we get a chance to actually compete in practice and in those live opportunities.”

The Rams are in the second week of their virtual offseason program. NFL facilities are closed indefinitely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so rookies might not be on the field with teammates until training camp. Rookies can begin attending virtual team meetings next Monday.

Akers said he can be “a game-changer” for a team that is in need of a spark. The Rams finished 9-7 last season and missed the playoffs for the first time in three seasons under McVay.

“As far as filling Todd Gurley’s shoes — just going to come in and play,” Akers said. “Wherever the team needs me to be, whatever they need me to do, that’s what I’ll do.”

Akers played quarterback and running back in high school in Mississippi, and displayed his passing prowess during his freshman season at Florida State. In a game against Boston College, he ran left with a handoff, and then squared his shoulders and completed an option pass that traveled more than 50 yards.

His quarterback background helps him break down defenses as a running back, he said.

“Having that edge, having that quarterback thought process when approaching the line of scrimmage and approaching every play,” he said.

Florida State finished with a 6-7 record in 2019, but Rams general manager Les Snead said Akers still showed up on film despite playing with offensive line that was not as stout as past Seminole teams. Akers joined Warrick Dunn and Dalvin Cook as the only players in Florida State history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in multiple seasons.

Louisiana State’s Clyde Edwards-Helaire, selected by the Kansas City Chiefs, was the only running back chosen in the first round of the draft last month. Georgia’s D’Andre Swift and Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor were drafted early in the second round before the Rams chose Akers with the 52nd pick.

“He runs angry,” Snead said. “He runs like he wants to punish a defense.”

Former Florida receiver Van Jefferson, the Rams’ second-round draft pick, saw Akers up close during games between the rival schools. In a loss to the Gators last season, Akers rushed for 102 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown run.

“He’s an elusive back. … a lot of times he would just break out in huge runs,” Jefferson said. “So, that always wasn’t good for being the opposing team, but I’m excited to be on the same side as him.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/sports/rams/story/2020-05-04/running-back-cam-akers-was-drafted-in-second-round-by-the-rams
"['Food Columnist', 'Lucas Kwan Peterson Is A Columnist', 'Video Producer For The Los Angeles Times Food Section.']",2020-05-05  ,The official Ben & Jerry’s ice cream power rankings,"How’s everyone’s first year of quarantine going? I’ve firmly moved into the “bargaining” zone of the Kübler-Ross five stages of grief: How many times will I eat pizza this week, three or four? Are showers on the table? Maybe. Would I pay someone $20 for a hug right now? Likely more. As you can see, in quarantine, absolutely anything is negotiable.

It is in that spirit that I bring you the infallible, completely factual and 100% correct Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream Power Rankings. Yes, even our nation’s most adored 420-loving capitalists must eventually fall under the tires of the Power Rankings cement truck. We’re dealing with ice cream only for the purposes of these rankings, folks — nothing “lite,” no fro-yo, and none of your fancy nut milks. You kids stay off my lawn!

I’ve ranked these by taste, of course, as well as a metric that honors the various states of incapacitation when we devour an entire pint at 2 a.m.: If this ice cream were a person, how stoned would it be? One more thing: Unlike most Power Rankings, where there are items that clearly fall into Good and Bad categories, nearly all of these ice creams were good. But they must, alas, be ranked — in that, there shall be no bargaining.

1) Peanut Butter Half Baked

I’m not much of a cookie dough guy, but I can’t deny the greatness of this ice cream. Chocolate and peanut butter ice creams converge in a maelstrom of calor-rific glory and are peppered with brownie and peanut butter cookie dough chunks. Of course chocolate and peanut butter go together like Cheech and Chong; I found that the stickiness of the brownie bits offsets the graininess of the cookie dough.

To make a 1998 Bulls analogy — Jordan and Pippen are like the two ice creams. They hold it all together and do most of the work. Kukoc and Rodman are like the brownie and cookie dough chunks. Luc Longley is the … spoon? The United Center is the freezer. Phil Jackson is your conscience, telling you not to eat too much. Defensive specialist Randy Brown is the part of your brain that’s honestly just happy to be along for the ride and wants you to keep going even when Phil says to take a break.

Look, I didn’t say the analogy was perfect.



2) New York Super Fudge Chunk

If there’s one thing we loved about Ben & Jerry’s when we discovered it as kids, and what we still love about it, it’s all the stuff. Every pint of Ben & Jerry’s is just loaded with chunks of stuff.

Advertisement

New York Super Fudge Chunk is that ideal, perfected: Every cubic inch is so full of something that is not ice cream — pecans, walnuts, almonds, fudge chunks — it’s frankly a wonder they don’t market this as frozen trail mix. But this is why we love Ben & Jerry’s: We want to chew our ice cream, not merely lick it.



3) Phish food

This entry goes out to L.A. Times Food editor Peter Meehan, who was and maybe still is, the biggest Phish fan I know. You see, it’s Meehan’s fault that I purchased the Phish album “Junta” in high school, in an effort to be cooler than I was and sat for hours at home trying to make sense of lyrics like,

I look into the finance box

Just to check my status

I look into the microscope

See Golgi apparatus

While Phish never really clicked with me, this ice cream certainly does. Chocolate ice cream with marshmallow, caramel and fudge fish leave this just a few nuts away from perfection — but then it’d just be Rocky Road, wouldn’t it? Instead of what it is: an exceptional-tasting ice cream with smooth, creamy textures that let you linger and get lost inside, like a Trey Anastasio guitar solo. By far the most stoner-y of the line-up.

4) Americone Dream

The waffle cone bits make this. The smell of sweet dough appeals to anyone who’s been to a state fair or inside a Blue Bottle, and this flavor, modeled on the persona of “Report""-era Stephen Colbert, manages to capture some of that magic. The light, crunchy sweetness of the fudge-covered bits are as wistful and nostalgic as the times we thought it was funny to watch a pretend right-wing blowhard spew hatred and misinformation. Remember those days?



5) Cherry Garcia

One of the OG flavors, Cherry Garcia is still one of the best. Fun story: The flavor originated when a woman named Jane Williamson sent a postcard to the Burlington office in 1986 suggesting the flavor. It debuted the following year and became one of the company’s most popular flavors. The woman got a year’s supply of ice cream in thanks.

While she should have gotten a fat check, frankly, at least the ice cream is still good. Ben & Jerry’s doesn’t do much in the fruit arena, and it’s nice to see this flavor endure. Cherry ice cream with fat cherry chunks and flecks of chocolate? Put “American Beauty” on repeat and hook me up.

6) Mint Chocolate Cookie

Any kind of mint/chocolate combo is going to be a winner, so I’ll use this space to pose the question: What’s better, cookies or chips? I’m actually a chip person, because of the texture, but I see the position of those on team cookie. Unearthing a cookie is more enjoyable and exciting than the pervasiveness of chips, and again plays into Ben & Jerry’s M.O. of packing their pints full of huge chunks.

A classic, irrefutable flavor combination, if not the most innovative.



7) Chip Happens

Marketed as, “A cold mess of chocolate ice cream with fudge chips and crunchy potato chip swirls,” the guys took a slight gamble on this flavor that largely pays off. They didn’t put entire potato chips into the pints but instead mashed the chips and spread them throughout the mixture.

The chips stay pretty remarkably crunchy and retain most of their salty, potatoey flavor. If you’ve ever enjoyed dipping hot fries into a Wendy’s Frosty, take this for a spin.

8) Chocolate Therapy

Remember Cathy? No, not from when you had co-workers and regular human contact, the one from the comic strip who’s always saying, “Ack!” I feel like this is an ice cream Cathy might enjoy, as would the inner Cathy in each and every one of us. It says, “We heard you liked chocolate, so we put chocolate in your chocolate.”

Chocolate ice cream is swirled with chocolate pudding ice cream — an important distinction — that is dotted with chocolate cookies. The creaminess of the regular ice cream contrasts subtly with the more viscous pudding cream. The difference is small but essential and will make you want to slide right into your favorite pair of sweatpants.



9) Peanut Butter Cup

Can you possibly go wrong with peanut butter ice cream and huge peanut butter cups? Nope. The massive cups are a chunky reminder of why this brand became popular in the first place. I like to imagine, back in 1978 when Ben & Jerry’s was founded, two guys in a Burlington basement ripping a 4-foot bong and cramming whatever food they could find into their gullets. After stuffing themselves with peanut butter and chocolate and washing it down with some local full-fat milk, the idea struck them for this particular flavor of shame salve. Wouldn’t want it to go down any other way.



10) Vanilla

A surprise flavor rounding out the top ten: Good old, plain-ass vanilla. Ben & Jerry’s is actually one of the best out there. It even has the tiny bean flecks that give the ice cream a distinct psychological edge. “Wow, real flecks of vanilla bean?” you ask yourself. “They’re not messing around!” Ideal in a root beer or Coke float.

Advertisement

This falls extremely low on the stoner scale — right now I find a sobering pint of pure vanilla is needed to confront every fresh new workday.

11) The Tonight Dough

Love or hate Jimmy Fallon, he seems like a man who tries extremely hard at everything he does. His namesake ice cream, while good, does the same: It’s trying to be too much to too many people. Caramel ice cream and chocolate ice cream and chocolate cookies and chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter cookie dough? Just... tone it down a little, dude. You’ve made it. You can relax.



12) Chocolate Fudge Brownie

A flavor that is, unlike some presidents, unimpeachable. Sticky chocolate brownies in chocolate ice cream — there’s nothing I would change.

Advertisement

(Martina Ibáñez-Baldor and Jade Cuevas / Los Angeles Times)

13) Cannoli

Who knew? Cannoli: Good for ice cream, good for running errands with Clemenza and Rocco. This mixture uses mascarpone instead of the usual ricotta and comes through with a rich, custard-like flavor. The chocolate-covered pastry shell bits could be a little crisper, but they manage to capture the spirit of the Sicilian confection.



14) Oat of this Swirled

This ended up being a winner for the most part, but not for the reasons advertised — this wasn’t particularly oaty. This is ultimately a cinnamon ice cream, with tasty, satisfyingly spicy cookie swirls. The choice of laying the toppings down in a field of brown sugar ice cream was an inspired one; it gives the pint a lovely, slightly caramelized quality.



15) Everything But The …

I wish they’d just finish the sentence. Kitchen sink? Trash can lid? Refrigerator door? Ellipses don’t belong in the names of food. Regardless, this ice cream is a good mess, but it’s still a mess. Cramming peanut butter cups, toffee chunks, white chocolate pieces and fudge-covered almonds all together means no one element gets the chance to shine. Given the MedMen-icated state you’re likely in when you crack this pint open, it probably doesn’t matter.

16) Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough

Not my fave, but a classic nonetheless. Something about the gritty, sandy texture of cookie dough has always rubbed me the wrong way. I’d far rather somebody else did the work, baked the cookies and put those in my ice cream. Nevertheless, I understand the appeal, and that as a snacky shortcut, it makes sense. Ben & Jerry’s makes as good a version as you can hope to find.



17) Chunky Monkey

Honestly, I was prepared to put this flavor at No. 1 — or at least in the top five. But after trying a few bites, I just couldn’t do it: The banana flavor is off. It lacks the dense, almost booze-y sweetness of a real overripe banana, veering instead into Laffy Taffy/Runts territory. It’s about as close to a banana as grape soda is to a grape. While the chocolate chunks and walnuts are ultimately satisfying, the very raison d’etre of the pint, the titular monkey’s aspect, is a somewhat disappointing mirage.



18) Half Baked

What’s not to like? Cookie dough and brownie chunks make for a winning combination, and the ice cream proves better than the Dave Chappelle comedy of the same name. It ranks highly in the stoned category, naturally, though I don’t know it gives the unmedicated a strong reason to reach across the freezer aisle.

19) Gimme S’More

Ah, wilderness! Who among us doesn’t remember getting picked on by older kids in Scouts and then promptly drowning our sorrows in a delicious s’more seasoned with wet, salty tears? In my case, I could never quite perfect the marshmallow. I’d soon lose my patience while trying to slowly roast it and then hold the thing directly on the fire, resulting in a charred outside and nearly raw center.

Still, the flavor of graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallow takes me back. It doesn’t quite capture the trauma of growing up, but at least it’s delicious.



20) Salted Caramel Core

This is the best of the “core” ice creams, which is a Ben & Jerry’s variation I’ve never quite jibed with. Why place all of the good stuff in one centralized, predictable area? Half the fun of ice cream is the randomized chaos of not knowing exactly what you’re going to get in a given bite.

The core ice creams ruin that fun, like a deconstructed Caesar salad: Here’s a romaine leaf, there’s a wedge of cheese, a piece of toasted bread there and an egg over there. It’s too clever for its own good.

Advertisement

Then again, maybe you just want to eat the entire core? In that case, I can see a point to the approach. The salted caramel could be a little more salty, but it goes nicely with the sweet cream ice cream and chewy blondie bits.

21) Pistachio Pistachio

There are better pistachio ice creams out there. This one has nice plump nuts scattered throughout, but the flavor of the ice cream proper is off. It tastes a little like almond extract. Nevertheless, the dads out there will love it, leading to its low score on the stoner scale.



22) Vanilla Caramel Fudge

This one is smooth baby, smooth, and should probably be ranked higher than it is — I just have an affinity for stuff and this doesn’t have any stuff in it. What it lacks in the chunk department, though, it makes up for in slick, sticky sweetness. The caramel and fudge meld in a dreamy, seamless way to produce an entirely new ice cream topping, fudgamel, where you’re not quite sure where one stops and the other takes over. If you give yourself over to this ice cream, you may never come back from the edge.

Advertisement

23) Milk & Cookies

Inoffensive and, in theory, a totally fun and charming ice cream flavor. Who doesn’t love milk and cookies? What this flavor doesn’t really take into account, though, is that the pleasure of milk and cookies derives primarily from 1) the contrast of a hot cookie with cold milk and/or 2) the soaking of a cookie in the milk, leading to a pleasantly sodden cookie.

Here, neither of those sensations comes through. The cookies are crisp, and somewhat grainy, and do little to evoke any Santa-esque memories.



24) Brownie batter core

Does too much of a good thing exist? The answer is obviously “no,” but if it did, this would be it. The brownie core here is so slick and sweet, so intense, that it simply overwhelms. It’s very fudgy and extremely rich, but after a spoonful or two, it has me missing the chewiness of the regular Ben & Jerry’s brownies.



25) Justice ReMix’d

With just the slightest bit of pep in the brownies and a cinnamon-loaded bun dough, you’re on the express train to Spice City, next stop, Seasoning Station! This flavor, which was created to benefit criminal justice reform , doesn’t quite capture the magic of a fresh cinnamon bun or a spicy cup of hot chocolate, but it’s more than adequate.

26) Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake

This is the best of Ben & Jerry’s cheesecake offerings I tried, and it quite nearly works. But the cheesecake needs to be much more tangy and assertive; Right now it sort of limps along like an injured animal. Caramel and chocolate will make anything taste good, but the cheesecake, the ostensible star of the show, needs to step more into the spotlight.



27) Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Core

Again with the cores. Would you order a bag of Cheetos that was separated into two compartments: Plain, unflavored corn puffs and pure, cheese powder? I mean, maybe you would. Maybe I would too.

OK, I definitely would. But that’s not the point: Like Beatles albums, ice cream is meant to be consumed as a whole, not cherry-picked for your favorite bits. Otherwise you could just buy a tube of cookie dough, right?

Advertisement

28) Coffee Toffee Bar Crunch

I feel like once they had to take “Heath bar” out of the name, this flavor really tanked. The toffee chunks just aren’t buttery enough; they taste mostly of sugar. The coffee ice cream lacks the deep, rich earthiness you’ll find in some of the bolder and better coffee ice creams on the market.

Think of it in terms of an improv 101 class. Make bold choices! Fully commit! Many times, that in and of itself can make the difference between hackneyed character and something truly worthy of a self-taped audition. This ice cream needs to give itself a pep talk in the hallway and give it another shot.



29) Netflix & Chilll’d

With its ready-for-Tinder name, this had the potential to be the sexiest of the entries. Peanut butter ice cream with pretzels and fudge brownies should be knock-it-out-of-the-park good! But the pretzels are chalky and dry and the brownies are tacky, not chewy, landing this somewhere near the Gatorade cooler in the dugout. Just goes to show that money can buy you more content than you’ll be able to watch in 100 lifetimes, but it can’t get you a great ice cream flavor.



30) Strawberry Cheesecake

Cheesecake needs to be tangy; Fruity ice cream needs to be fruity. This wasn’t particularly either.

Advertisement

What are you up to, strawberry cheesecake ice cream? Did you come to play? Or did you come to half-heartedly jog up and down the court and knock down a couple of early shots but, when push comes to shove, give up, fake an injury and go home? I suspect the latter, and I’m a little disappointed in you.



31) Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake Truffles

I can’t tell the difference between this and the regular Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake, but this has graham cracker-coated cheesecake “truffles” instead of regular cheesecake chunks. Why they made an entirely separate flavor with such a minute distinction is lost on me, but it wasn’t a good idea. This is the inferior product. The cheesecake has very little tang, and the graham cracker makes the bits taste slightly dusty. Pass.



32) Wake & “No Bake” Cookie Dough Core

The only flavor that I actively didn’t enjoy. The no-bake cookie dough in this wink-wink-nudge-nudge cleverly-named creation is sickly sweet with a terrible rabbit-food texture. It’s sandy and pasty like a Clif Bar, with the density and distressing flavor to match.

But to Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, I say: You’re allowed a couple of misses now and again, guys.

So, we’re here to get you started.

Each day we’re going to post a new skill here and go in detail about how to do it — a resource for cooking basics so you can get food on the table and get through this.

Lesson 33: Meatloaf

Meatloaf might not be the sexiest dish, but it has stood the test of time for a reason. It’s a crowd-pleaser that everyone loves no matter how much they may profess to liking something fancier, the Adam Sandler of dishes.

I know what you’re thinking: Do I really need a new recipe for meatloaf?

Advertisement

There are no new-fangled tricks or techniques in this recipe. To flavor the meat, I blend together a cheater’s maitre d’hotel butter — combining the traditional soft butter, parsley and lemon juice with shallots and garlic in a food processor. It is an old-school compound butter for serving melted over cooked steaks in French bistros and there’s no better combination of seasonings yet devised that make beef taste better. I mix the flavored butter with ground beef and a cursory amount of breadcrumbs and egg to hold it all together. That’s it.

The only vague “twist” here is to place the meatloaf in a hot skillet before it goes in the oven. The bottom gets crusty and caramelized like a hamburger patty. It’s easy to do and makes a huge difference in texture to have that crunchy part in the mix.

For the top, I stick with classic ketchup straight from the bottle. No one wants a homemade ketchup or any other flavoring to distract from the star of the show. But if you have the will to do so, I suggest stirring a tablespoon of vinegar into the ketchup first to bump up its acidic edge and cut the sweetness.

The vinegar in the ketchup, the flavored butter, and cooking the meatloaf in a heated skillet — the right amount of small nips and tucks here and there that make a classic more appealing than the uncut gem it always was.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05  ,Trump denies ties to Venezuelan attack; two U.S. men jailed,"President Trump said Tuesday the United States had nothing to do with an alleged incursion into Venezuela that landed two U.S. citizens behind bars in the troubled South American nation.

Trump said he had just learned of the detention of the pair, accused by Venezuela of being mercenaries. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said they were part of an operation to kill him that was backed by neighboring Colombia and the United States.

“Whatever it is, we’ll let you know,” Trump told reporters in Washington before departing from the White House to Arizona. “But it has nothing to do with our government.”

Authorities in Venezuela identified the two men as Luke Denman and Airan Berry, both former U.S. Special Forces soldiers associated with the Florida-based private security firm Silvercorp USA.

A third U.S. ex-Green Beret and Silvercorp founder, Jordan Goudreau, claimed responsibility for leading “Operation Gideon,” which was launched with an attempted beach landing before dawn on Sunday that left eight suspected attackers dead.

The two ex-U.S. soldiers were detained Monday dozens of miles from the first attempted beach landing in a fishing village. Authorities say they’ve confiscated equipment and detained dozens of others.

Goudreau said the operation was designed to capture — and not kill — Maduro. He said he carried it out on a “shoestring budget” after signing an agreement with U.S.-backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, whom Goudreau accuses of failing to pay him. Guaidó denies having any relationship with Goudreau.

Venezuela is gripped by a deepening social and economic crisis under Maduro’s rule that has led nearly 5 million residents to flee crumbling social services, such as unreliable water, electricity and broken hospitals.

Advertisement

The U.S. is among nearly 60 nations that back Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, saying Maduro clings to power despite a sham election in 2018 that banned the most popular opposition candidates from running.

Venezuela and the U.S. broke diplomatic ties a year ago, so there is no U.S. embassy operating in Venezuela’s capital of Caracas.

“It shocks me how insane they were,” said Mike Vigil, the former head of international operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration. “They walked right into a coiled rattlesnake without even having minimally studied the capacity of the Venezuelan armed forces. There’s no way the U.S. government would’ve supported an operation like this.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-05/trump-denies-ties-to-venezuelan-attack-with-2-us-men-jailed
"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05  ,"U.S. couple’s nightmare: Held in China, away from their teenage daughter","The first thing Daniel Hsu noticed about the room was that there were no sharp edges. The walls were covered with beige rubber, the table wrapped in soft gray leather. White blinds covered two barred windows.

Five surveillance cameras recorded his movements, and two guards kept constant, silent watch. They followed Hsu to the shower and stood beside him at the toilet.

Lights blazed through the night. If he rolled over on his mattress, guards woke him and made him turn his face toward a surveillance camera that recorded him as he slept. He listened for sounds of other prisoners but heard only the occasional roar of a passing train.

“First, keep healthy,” Hsu told himself. “Second, keep strong.”

Advertisement

He had no idea when or how he would get out.

Hsu is a U.S. citizen. He has not been convicted of any crime in China, yet he was detained there for six months in solitary confinement under conditions that could qualify as torture under international conventions. Authorities from eastern Anhui province placed exit bans on Hsu and his wife, Jodie Chen, blocking them from returning home to suburban Seattle in August 2017 and effectively orphaning their 16-year-old daughter in America.

Critics say the Chinese Communist Party’s expanding use of exit bans to block people — including U.S. citizens and permanent residents — from leaving China reeks of hostage-taking and collective punishment. They also warn that it lays bare China’s will to exert influence not just over Chinese citizens in China, but also permanent residents and citizens of other countries.

“American citizens are too often being detained as de facto hostages in business disputes or to coerce family members to return to China. This is shocking and unacceptable behavior by the Chinese government and a clear violation of international law,” said James P. McGovern, chair of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China.

Hsu says Anhui authorities have been effectively holding them hostage in order to convince his father, Xu Weiming, to come back from the U.S. and face charges he embezzled 447,874 yuan (worth $63,000 today) more than 20 years ago — an allegation Xu denies.

The COVID-19 pandemic has added grave new urgency to their desire to leave. Despite fear of retribution, the family is speaking out for the first time, offering a rare account of life inside China’s opaque system of exit bans and secretive detention centers.

Their story is supported by Chinese court documents and correspondence and interviews with U.S. and Chinese government officials. Some details could not be independently verified but are in line with accounts from other detainees.

Five days before Hsu entered the smooth beige room at a Communist Party-run “education center” in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province, his stepdaughter, Mandy Luo, boarded a flight from Shanghai to Seattle alone. She had been on a family visit to China and was supposed to return with her mother to finish high school. But airport security had blocked her mother from boarding.

Mandy vomited for 10 hours on the flight home. “Mom,” she kept thinking, “why are you not here?”

The answer to that question lies in Chinese laws that give authorities broad discretion to block both Chinese citizens and foreign nationals from leaving the country. Minor children, a pregnant woman and a pastor — all with foreign passports — have been banned from exiting, according to people with direct knowledge of the cases.

Advertisement

The U.S., Canada and Australia have issued advisories warning their citizens that they can be prevented from leaving China over disputes they may not be directly involved in.

“U.S. diplomats frequently raise the issue of exit bans and the need for transparency with the PRC government,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email. “The Department has raised Mr. Hsu’s case at the highest levels and will continue to do so until he is allowed to return home to the U.S.”

Within China, exit bans have been celebrated as part of a best-practices toolkit for convincing corrupt officials to return to China for prosecution, part of President Xi Jinping’s sweeping campaign to purify the ruling Communist Party and shore up its moral authority. Many corruption suspects fled to the U.S., Australia and Canada, which do not have extradition treaties with China.

Requests for comment to Anhui province’s Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, Public Security Department and procuratorate, as well as the province’s foreign affairs and propaganda offices all went unanswered. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing declined to comment.

Hsu was accused of being a co-conspirator in the corruption case against his father, Xu. The Hefei Intermediate People’s Court found that Xu embezzled money for real estate in the 1990s while serving as chairman of Shanghai Anhui Yuan Industrial Corp. At the time, Hsu was half a world away, studying accounting at the University of San Francisco.

Xu denies the charges. In a letter to the court, he wrote that the money was a housing stipend, vetted by a government audit committee and awarded to dozens of employees. He said he is the target of a political vendetta.

“If my dad’s rich, OK, I deserve this maybe,” said Hsu, who ran a barbecue restaurant in Bellevue, Wash., which he was forced to sell during his involuntary exile. “But I never enjoy anything. I don’t have a Ferrari. I don’t have a yacht. I’m just a small business owner.”

Advertisement

His interrogations came in fits and starts. He gazed at the smooth edges in his room and thought about hurting himself. He fantasized that a Delta Force chopper would rescue him. The men would break through the walls and say, “You’re free, sir. Come with us.” No one came.

“Try to sit in a room for three hours and tell me how do you feel, just by yourself. You have nothing,” he said in an interview.

Before coming to the party education center, Hsu had spent 14 days in detention in Hefei, sharing a cell and one bucket toilet with two dozen men. Hsu asked police to send him back. At least there were other people, TV, chess. Even his cellmate who allegedly murdered his girlfriend was kind of nice.

In mid-September police gave Hsu a phone so he could convince his parents to return. His mother told him they’d written letters to Washington. “Be strong,” she said. “I am proud of you.”

After a few days, the phone was taken away. Hsu had been given a mission, to convince his father to return, and he had failed.

Hsu was being held under “residential surveillance in a designated location,” a legal mechanism that allows detentions of up to six months without formal charges or judicial review in certain cases.

The United Nations has urged Beijing to halt the practice, saying it “may amount to incommunicado detention in secret places, putting detainees at a high risk of torture or ill-treatment.”

Advertisement

China is a signatory to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which defines torture as an intentional abuse of power by the state that causes severe physical or mental suffering. It signed, but did not ratify, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which precludes torture as well as “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.”

Joshua Rosenzweig, a deputy regional director at Amnesty International in Hong Kong, said that though residential surveillance sounds better than throwing someone in jail, in practice it’s one of the most excruciating forms of detention under Chinese law. In Hsu’s case, he said, prolonged solitary confinement and 24-hour surveillance seemed designed to cause psychological suffering with the aim of coercing him to do something.

“That would clearly satisfy the criteria for torture and other ill treatment,” Rosenzweig said. “The ability, inside a black box, to carry out this kind of coercion against someone — it’s incredible this is allowed to go on.”

Over time, and late at night, Hsu’s guards relaxed. Hsu discovered one was a fan of Manchester United. Others wanted to know what the schools were like America and how much real estate cost. Eventually, he said, he got one guy to bring him a caramel macchiato from Starbucks.

Advertisement

In December, police announced that Hsu’s father had agreed to go back to China. Hsu was shocked. On Dec. 14, a consular officer came with news that his father had made a sworn statement declaring Hsu’s innocence.

His mother also sent word that her husband’s health was poor and he would postpone his return.

Hsu held his fists and began to shake.

Advertisement

The next morning, his minders yelled at him. They made him make a videotaped message. Hsu told his parents they should have kept their word and returned. He wrote a letter, telling them he was getting sick in his head, pulling his hair out, not sleeping.

The new rotation of guards refused to speak to him. He dreamed about his daughter and woke in the night, his face wet with tears.

Back in Seattle, Mandy was also struggling with solitude. But she didn’t want to add to the general misery, so she boxed up the rage and helplessness. Instead of shouting at her relatives, she wept in her family’s big, empty house.

“Why me?” she cried out, to no one in particular. “I’m only 16. What are you expecting of me?”

Advertisement

On Feb. 11, 2018, near the end of Hsu’s sixth month in detention, he was released. His wife, Jodie Chen, drove nine hours to pick him up. They tossed his prison books in a dumpster and went out to dinner.

Hsu watched his wife eat. He couldn’t bring himself to hug her.

After sleeping under blazing lights for six months, he could no longer sleep in the dark. Shanghai’s jostling crowds made him nervous. He kept crying.

Hsu, 43, and Chen, 44, were living off savings. Their marriage was rapidly deteriorating. When they weren’t fighting, they sat at home and stared at each other.

Friends offered Hsu jobs or money to start a restaurant in Shanghai. But he always declined, worried he’d get them in trouble.

The U.S. Consulate in Shanghai lobbied intensively on the couple’s behalf. But nothing changed.

In May 2019, immigration officers came to Hsu’s home and told him they were going to deport him because his visa had expired. They warned him he’d never be able to return to China.

Advertisement

“I said, ‘We can talk about that later, but deport me, please.’”

They didn’t.

In June 2019, Hsu and Chen missed their daughter’s high school graduation. In August, they recruited relatives to see her off to college.

Last month, at the request of Anhui authorities, Chen wrote a formal petition for her exit ban to be lifted.

Advertisement

“I miss my daughter so much, especially at this critical moment,” she wrote. “I do hope to take care of her, side by side, to fulfill my duty as a mother.”

She pledged to persuade her father-in-law to return to China, saying she would deepen her emotional bond with her in-laws to establish mutual trust, then explain the “tolerant and humanized approach” of Chinese justice.

It was unclear why Chen’s exit ban was lifted. Hsu would have to stay in China. “They told me if my dad is not coming back, I will never leave this country,” he said.

Advertisement

On April 10, Chen and Hsu rode to Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport in a diplomatic sedan, a small American flag on the hood flapping in the wind. The Shanghai consul general, Sean Stein, escorted Chen to the departure gate.

Chen’s trip back to Seattle took more than 24 hours. Concerned she might have picked up COVID-19 on the journey, she took an Uber from the airport to the leafy cul-de-sac they call home.

It had been 971 days since Chen had touched her daughter. She had planned to self-quarantine for two weeks, but Mandy couldn’t wait. She moved from her grandparents’ house and went into quarantine with her mother.

“It’s 50% over,” Mandy said. “My dad is the other 50%.”

Back in Shanghai, Daniel Hsu went home from Pudong airport and slept most of the day.

The refrain is the same every evening: praise for China’s handling of the coronavirus, dire scenes from foreign hospitals and condemnations of the United States.

The tone is often withering. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo was declared “the public enemy of humanity.” A few nights later, the anchor feigned sympathy for Americans, who she said were left to die while their government railed against China.

Beijing has pushed this story line at home for months — a mixture of self-congratulation for defeating the virus, denial of central government missteps, and horror at other countries’ failures to contain the pandemic.

Now, facing escalating international criticism over its handling of the outbreak and growing demands for an investigation into its origins, China has taken its strident nationalist message abroad. The strategy is provoking a backlash and colliding with President Trump’s insistence that China covered up the danger of the pathogen.

The undiplomatic invective matches the swagger of Xi Jinping’s China, which is richer and more influential than ever, and determined to shape the global narrative as it believes a superpower should — especially as the Chinese president confronts the biggest crisis of his tenure. Beijing sees itself as ascendant at a time that the United States’ stature as a world leader is ebbing.

Chinese ambassadors are attacking foreign officials on social media and peddling misinformation — amplified by the state-controlled press — to deflect blame for the virus that has killed a quarter of a million people and wrecked global economies.

The latest spat erupted last week after the Chinese ambassador to Australia appeared to threaten a consumer boycott over Australia’s calls for an independent inquiry into the outbreak. The Australian government accused Beijing, its biggest trading partner, of economic coercion; China denied it and warned Canberra to stop playing “political games.”

The editor of Global Times, a popular tabloid run by the Chinese Communist Party, weighed in on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, comparing Australia to “gum stuck to the bottom of China’s shoe: Sometimes you have to find a rock and scrape it off.”

Rising to China’s defense is a generation of diplomats and pundits dubbed the “Wolf Warriors,” after a recent pair of blockbuster action films featuring a muscled, globe-trotting Chinese commando who vanquishes Asian drug lords, African pirates and mercenaries led by a villainous American named Big Daddy.

The diplomats’ fields of battle are social media platforms — usually Twitter and Facebook, which are banned in China. Their weapons include outrage, sarcasm, an abiding suspicion of Western governments and the press, conspiracy theories and, it seems, the support of the Chinese leadership.

“In this environment in China, there’s no punishment for people who are overzealous in defending China,” said Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London. “You’re not going to lose your job if you overstep. Everyone is trying to demonstrate their loyalty.”

Wang Yong, professor of international studies at Peking University, called the “more assertive” style of some diplomats “a reaction to the blaming of China and China’s policies in fighting the pandemic” — especially by the United States.

U.S. news media have reported on China’s initial attempts to play down the scale of the outbreak in the central city of Wuhan, and on problems with medical equipment it has sent to other countries. The allegations have blunted Beijing’s own spin: that it has defeated the virus and is leading the medical and humanitarian response to the outbreak.

The Trump administration, under fire for its own missteps, has increasingly emphasized the pandemic’s origins. Pompeo has claimed the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory — which scientists say is unlikely — and said over the weekend that “China has a history of infecting the world.”

“The old way is to always accept: ‘China does this, China does that,’ an agenda set by American politicians,” Wang said. “I think now Americans should have a second thought about this approach.”

A decade ago, Beijing’s diplomats kept a low profile in world capitals — dark-suited sphinxes who rarely engaged with the press or the public. In the Wolf Warrior era — with China and the U.S. locked in a bitter struggle over trade, technological primacy and geopolitical influence — their combative statements fly like arrows from embassies around the globe.

“Ridiculous and eyeball-catching nonsense,” tweeted the spokeswoman for the Chinese Embassy in India, responding to demands that China pay compensation for the spread of the virus.

“Other countries shouldn’t blame China for mistakes they have made themselves, particularly the U.S.,” tweeted the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands.

The Chinese Embassy in Venezuela ended an angry Twitter thread — which began by complaining about Venezuelan officials referring to the “Chinese coronavirus” — by saying that some of its critics could “put on a mask and shut up.”

Offensive and gratuitous, to some. But the Global Times, in a recent article, said China’s people “are no longer satisfied with a flaccid diplomatic tone.”

The star among the Wolf Warriors is Zhao Lijian, a 47-year-old recently installed as a deputy spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Zhao came to prominence last year when, as the No. 2 at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan, he got into a Twitter feud with former U.S. national security advisor Susan Rice, who called him a “racist disgrace.”

In March, Zhao suggested on Twitter that the U.S. Army had smuggled the virus into Wuhan. The unfounded conspiracy theory was echoed in state media, but raised eyebrows among more moderate members of China’s diplomatic corps, including the ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, who said it was “very harmful” to speculate about the virus’ origins.

“Lijian is representative of a group of younger spokespersons who are unapologetic,” Brown said. “The mindset is not about keeping a low profile. They feel they shouldn’t have to be in that position because they don’t see Americans or Europeans going around the world bowing their heads and apologizing, so why should they?”

Analysts say the pandemic has revealed China’s willingness to expand its use of disinformation campaigns — previously focused on undermining pro-democracy voices in Taiwan and Hong Kong — to the wider world. As early as 2015, scholars from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies predicted that the People’s Liberation Army would use Twitter to deliver propaganda to new audiences “to influence the global conversation about China.”

“Beijing has been playing this game for a long time in Taiwan and Hong Kong,” said Nadege Rolland, a senior fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington. “It has all the necessary architecture to deploy such tactics and has garnered a great deal of experience in previous disinformation campaigns.”

Wang, of Peking University, acknowledged that the Wolf Warrior style had sparked a debate within the party, although he declined to say whether such behavior would help China’s image globally.

“We are in a new context, new circumstances,” he said. “The diplomats and government officials will learn from the process, from the reaction of others, what is the best way of communication.”

Part of the strategy was laid out in a recent article on a website run by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It proposed tactics that included: a 24-hour, rapid-response operation to quickly answer attacks; promoting Chinese social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat as alternatives to Twitter and Facebook; discussing China’s shortcomings where they exist; and remaining “calm and objective” while convincing people “through reason.”

So far, however, the pugnacious voices are resounding, threatening China’s ties with other nations.

In Australia, which relies on China as a market for iron ore and other exports, and is a major destination for Chinese tourists and students, the prospect of an economic boycott by Beijing drew condemnations from across the political spectrum.

“It was already dawning on many Australians that the strategic risk of overdependence on China was a problem that needed to be resolved,” said Ashley Townshend, director of foreign policy at the United States Studies Center in Australia.

“The pandemic and China’s issuance of threats will quicken those calls for our own increased resilience.”

But analysts say the menacing tone feeds patriotic sentiment in China, where the party is eager to limit the damage of an outbreak that has killed thousands and tipped the economy into decline for the first time in at least three decades.

Foreign criticism “strikes right at the heart of one of the myths that the party has been cultivating to bolster its legitimacy at home: that the [Chinese Communist Party] is efficient, competent and capable, and that it is the only one able to effectively lead the nation,” Rolland said.

Shortly after Xi was named the party’s general secretary in 2012 — on his way to becoming the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong — he reportedly said in a speech that one of the reasons the Communist Party collapsed in the Soviet Union was that “nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.”

“I think that Chinese diplomats are currently trying to show that they are man enough to stand up for the CCP,” Rolland said.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05  ,"75 years after World War II, search for missing soldiers continues","Thomas Siepert looks across the verdant grain field, which glows in the sun after a spring thunderstorm, with windmills slowly churning in the distance. Wild boar piglets trundle across the road into town, and a hare pops out and dashes away.

The serene scene belies the slaughter 75 years ago on the same patch of land as German troops fought furiously — and futilely — to stave off the Soviet Red Army, which was approaching Berlin.

“It seems so idyllic, but it’s a huge cemetery,” Siepert said. “That shouldn’t be forgotten.”

But for decades after the Allied victory in Europe — whose 75th anniversary is Friday — many of those who died there were indeed forgotten. Some were buried where they fell, while others were dragged by civilians in the months after the war into trenches and foxholes they had themselves dug, and were covered over.

For the last 15 years, volunteers like Siepert from around Europe have been trying to rectify that, devoting vacations to excavating long-buried trench lines and military positions in the search for those who never made it home.

During 19 digs on less than half a square mile of land, members of the Assn. for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe have found 116 German and 129 Soviet soldiers.

They seek to identify as many as possible — to provide closure for families, to give the dead their names back and to separate them from the numbers in the history books in the hope of explaining the cost of war to future generations.

“On all sides, these are destroyed lives. These are all people who died senselessly,” said Albrecht Laue, chairman of the association. “If we talk about a huge slaughter with hundreds of thousands of dead, nobody can understand that. But if I talk about the story of a young 17-year-old soldier, that’s tangible.”

Laue, a 46-year-old businessman from Hamburg, got interested in the search when looking for the grave of his grandfather, which he located near where he died fighting in Russia in 1942 as a young lieutenant.

Siepert, 47, an engineer from nearby Frankfurt an der Oder, remembers as a child having regular lectures in school about avoiding the grenades and other munitions still found in the area, and wondering why.

Other volunteers include anthropologists, archaeologists, excavators and the disposal experts needed when munitions are found. They hail from all over, including Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands.

“We couldn’t, and also don’t want to, look for soldiers from a specific nation,” Laue said. “That’s the interesting thing when one finds one of the dead; one never even knows at the beginning if it’s a German or a Soviet.”

In February 1945, they were bitter foes.

The village of Klessin sits on a height a little more than a mile from the Oder River. German military observers used it to call in artillery strikes on Soviet troops as they streamed across a pontoon bridge in the buildup before the final push on Berlin.

Recognizing the strategic importance of the hamlet 60 miles east of Berlin, the Soviets made it a target. The Nazis resolved to hold it, moving in a unit of soldiers, augmented by officer cadets and older “Volkssturm” militia, scraped up as the number of military-age men dwindled.

The fighting pitted 400 Germans in Klessin against about four times that number of Soviets, with the Germans supported by a unit of Panther tanks in the neighboring village of Podelzig, nearby artillery and air-dropped supplies.

Fierce combat raged for nearly two months, often hand-to-hand, as the Soviets attempted to take the village, firing off 62,000 mortar rounds and artillery shells.

Exactly how many were killed or listed as missing is not known, but the casualties were enormous, Siepert said.

“On March 20, German troops tried to break through there to make a corridor,” he said, pointing to a field between Klessin and Podelzig where the Soviets had laid a minefield and other defenses after encircling the village. “There were 150 missing from that single attack, as well as 50 killed. Seventy made it through.”

On March 23, 1945, the beleaguered German soldiers attempted a breakout under the cover of darkness. About 60 made it, and the others were captured or killed.

German tank commander Lt. Hans Eimer was listed as missing after the breakout attempt. Eimer had led his Panther tank into Klessin the week before on his 22nd birthday to support the garrison, but the vehicle ended up being knocked out, and he was wounded and trapped in the village.

Eimer’s younger brother, Fritz, had died in fighting that January. After the war, his sister, Margarete, had long urged Laue’s group to try to determine the fate of her only other sibling.

Eimer’s remains were located by Laue’s group in 2016 by chance and identified by dogtags. The group told Margarete before she died in 2018 that her brother had made it 250 yards out of the village before he was killed, and lay with two other soldiers.

Identifications are rare, especially of the Soviet soldiers who had no dogtags, but occasionally the volunteers get lucky.

In a dig on a Soviet outpost on a hill outside Klessin in 2018, they came across three Soviet soldiers who were all highly decorated and traced their names through the medals.

This year’s spring dig has been postponed because of lockdown restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. Some work is still underway on a memorial site being established amid the rubble of the original farm buildings.

Hermann Kaiser, a member of the small community association behind the memorial, said he remembered finding military materiel as a kid growing up in the area, happily throwing on an old steel helmet and fighting “war” with his friends, not understanding that they were playing on graves.

The hope is with the memorial to make sure that others do understand.

No one will tell you to wear a mask or take your temperature or demand blood work before you hit the road this summer.

But questions abound about this American institution, including whether it’s safe — at least, safer than airline travel.

Here’s what your road trip of the future may look like.



Is driving safer than flying?

People are increasingly looking at car trips for their vacation plans, according to data from MMGY Travel Intelligence in partnership with the U.S. Travel Assn. In a survey taken April 17-22, 47% of respondents said they would be more likely to travel by car, an increase from 35% in data collected April 4-11.

For all travelers, safety is a priority, and many are asking whether driving is safer than flying these days.

In terms of the coronavirus, probably, said Dr. Robert Winters, a Southern California infectious disease specialist.

“If traveling with others in a car, one would assume you know the person that is sitting next to you and you know their health status,” Winters said in an email.

“Car travel has to be safer than airline travel when you factor in controlled boarding/exiting processes, number of people on the airplane, unknown health status of people on the flight, uncooperative children sitting near you, etc.”

In terms of crashes, planes are safer. In 2019, about 39,000 people died in automobile accidents, according to the National Safety Council. Airplane crashes caused 257 deaths that year, according to To70’s aviation review.



Before you leave

•Do your car’s regular pre-trip check — tires, especially — that AAA recommends, noting that getting stranded may have greater consequences because of reduced service.

•Check conditions at your destination to ensure that you’re not hitting a hot spot. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a map that shows hot spots and provides data at bit.ly/coronavirushotspots

Advertisement

•Double-check whether the state you’re heading to has self-quarantine in effect. Although federal law cannot bar you from traveling to a state, local authorities can require self-quarantine for as long as 14 days. To check whether the state you’re planning to visit has such a regulation, call the state health authority from a list provided by the CDC: bit.ly/statehealthdepartments.

•Pack masks and gloves for all riders, Winters said, and make provisions for hand washing/sanitzer (BYOSS — bring your own soap and sanitizer). Disinfectant wipes are a must.

•Check in with your healthcare provider, AAA suggests, especially if your passengers are older or have medical issues.

•Pack a cooler with drinks and snacks, including high-protein goodies that will not go bad, to reduce the number of stops.

Advertisement

•Clean your car. About a third of drivers clean the inside of their car only about once a year, said Sheryl Connelly, a futurist who studies global consumer trends for Ford Motor Co., adding that the steering wheel is generally four times dirtier than a restroom. Besides that high-touch point, clean safety belts, door handles and even the fob you use to start the car. In the future, cars may have anti-microbial surfaces, she said. The CDC offers suggestions on how to sanitize your home, many of which are applicable to the car: bit.ly/CDCclisinfecting. (Bleach or cleaning solutions with bleaching agents should not be used on surfaces, such as carpeting, that are not colorfast.)

•Pack plenty of charging cords and perhaps external batteries for electronic devices. If your navigation system contains emergency calling, enable that as well, Connelly said.

•Plan like a demon. You don’t want to wing it, especially for hotels, restaurants or rest areas. And don’t rely on websites, said Bill Clevlen, a travel broadcaster and writer who travels to 50 or 60 destinations a year as he helps travelers “rediscover” America.

Advertisement

“If you’re planning on making a pit stop or two along your route, call ... to make sure the restaurant or rest area is actually going to be open,” he said in an email. “Some will have shut down for good or will have had hours change. This is particularly true in places that have relied solely on ‘travel traffic’ away from more populated areas.”

•Read the fine print. Understand the lodging’s cancellation rules. “Make sure the hotel or rental property you book has an iron-clad refund policy,” Clevlen said. “Major hotels seem to have been very reasonable, but still ask.” Booking directly with the hotel may spare you some back and forth with a third-party site if something goes wrong, he said.



And now, for some good news

In a year in which good news has been rare, here’s some: You’ll pay significantly less for gasoline. Small fluctuations in gas prices usually make little difference in your trip costs, but this year is an exception.

Advertisement

Let’s say you’re driving to San Francisco and back. You fill up in L.A. for the trip north at an average of $2.83 a gallon and in San Francisco at $2.99 a gallon for the trip home in a car that averages 30 mpg. This year, you’ll save more than $33 in gas, based on year-ago prices in both locations that topped $4 a gallon, according to the AAA Gas Prices report.

Will low prices continue? Definite maybe. Prices increased by a penny a gallon on May 1. As long as there is an oversupply of oil, as has been the case in recent weeks, your outlay for your miles on the L.A.-San Francisco trip may continue to total $75 or less.

One final, delicate topic: the rest stop

Calling ahead to be sure your favorite rest stop is open is a good idea. You’ll also want to take an occasional break and avoid driving drowsy, which accounted for more than 100,000 accidents in 2019, according to the National Safety Council. Further, the CDC notes that many thousands of Americans report “short sleep,” that is, getting less than seven hours a night.

If you look at the CDC’s map for California, it’s a wonder that Southern Californians can keep their eyes open: The stats show that people in L.A., Riverside and San Diego counties, among others, show the highest rate of sleep deprivation. Add to that the stress of recent events that’s keeping us awake, and it’s a formula for falling asleep at the wheel.

Advertisement

So by all means, stop. Pull over. Take a snooze. But before using the restroom, consider the grunge factors. You need a restroom with soap and hot water, two forceful combatants against the coronavirus.

Create a restroom break kit for each person traveling with you: small bars of soap, paper towels (for drying and avoiding high-touch handles), travel-size packs of toilet seat covers; include hand sanitizer and wipes for when soap and water are not available.

If you are at a gas station, consider the restroom break after you pump gas, and wash hands before and after. (If only pumping gas, gloves are a good idea. Dispose in the nearby trash containers, not on the ground.)

Overreacting? Possibly. But in this age of the coronavirus, we must act as though our life depends on the precautions we take.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/travel/story/2020-05-05/after-coronavirus-taking-car-road-trip
"['Audience Engagement Editor', 'Rachel Schnalzer Is An Audience Engagement Editor For The Los Angeles Times.']",2020-05-01  ,Is time flying by oddly quickly during COVID-19? Here’s why you may feel that way,"Think about your first day in quarantine. Does it feel like a lifetime ago? Or does it feel like yesterday?

Many people staying at home as a result of the coronavirus crisis are noticing time pass more strangely than usual. While some complain of days dragging on and on, others have taken to social media, explaining they feel the past several weeks have flown by eerily quickly.

Wow idk if it’s just me or what but time feels like it’s going fast while in quarantine. Weird. I swear I’m not going insane... yet. 😆😂 — K.G. (@heyitskriz) April 16, 2020

Turns out, science can provide some insight into why our perception of time is a little wonkier than normal while in quarantine. Here’s what the experts say:

Advertisement

Why do some feel as though time is passing unnaturally quickly?

“Time does seem to be going really fast,” agrees Claudia Hammond, author of “Time Warped: Unlocking the Mysteries of Time Perception,” noting that it’s our perception of time that feels unusual, separate from the way time actually works. In our minds, “time can warp very easily,” she says. But why does this happen?

For those staying at home during the pandemic, it has a lot to do with our worlds shrinking to the bare minimum — staying at home for the vast majority of the day, with trips outside only for exercise or a visit to the grocery store. For the most part, we are not taking part in particularly memorable activities, like getting drinks with a friend, going to a sporting event or traveling, says Marc Wittmann, an author and research fellow at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health in Freiburg, Germany. Now, there are fewer signals differentiating a Sunday from a Monday.

And if you’re doing the same thing every day — the new normal for many in quarantine — there’s no need to remember each day specifically. Even if time passes slowly in the moment, it’s likely that nothing will stand out upon looking back, causing you to perceive time has passed by quickly in the long run, Wittmann explains.

“The more emotional a memory, the longer perception of time duration.” This is why a weekend vacation will often feel longer than a weekend spent at home. And right now, many in quarantine are experiencing the opposite of a vacation, Hammond notes. “We’re not making loads of new memories now, so we don’t think lots of time has passed.”

James Broadway, an instructor of psychology at Lincoln Land Community College in Illinois, who has studied the brain’s perception of time, notes a similar phenomenon occurs when we age. The older we get, the fewer novel events we experience, which causes time to feel as if it’s going by faster than it did earlier in our lives. Hammond points out that a similar phenomenon can happen to people who are sick or incarcerated. Time will pass slowly as it’s experienced but then feel as if it’s gone by quickly in retrospect.

However, if you’ve felt as though time has taken a long time to pass during the pandemic, even retrospectively, you’re not alone. Adrian Bejan, a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Duke University, believes it’s possible the novelty of the quarantine experience could actually explain why weeks may feel like they’re dragging to some.

“The brain remembers the unusual,” he explains, and if our new routines are suddenly different, our brains would be bombarded with images worth remembering. This would then result in the perception that time is moving slowly over the quarantine experience, though it’s likely time will feel as though it’s speeding up again as the quarantine becomes more familiar.

It’s also important to note not everyone has the relative luxury of feeling bored at home while in quarantine. Many people are busier than ever, whether they’re working in a hospital on the front lines of the coronavirus or at home balancing a full work schedule while trying to home-school their children. It’s possible people who are busier than ever during the coronavirus crisis will look back and feel as though this period of their lives lasted longer than normal, Hammond suggests. “When they look back, it will be the other way around,” she says.

What can we do about it?

Our altered perspective of time can be useful during quarantine. Normally, when we’re bored, we have a plethora of options in front of us, like going to the gym or meeting up with friends. Now, we’re being challenged to spend time alone or with others in our household. “This could be a chance to learn how to cope with boredom and isolation,” Wittmann explains. “Learn to be at ease with being with yourself.”

If you’re feeling anxious and have difficulty coping with being alone, it’s helpful to have a goal, he says. Whether you’re aiming to exercise more or clean your apartment regularly, having a physical task to complete may help assuage feelings of stress and take your focus off the passage of time. This is a rare occasion in which you can take advantage of having more time at your disposal to do new things, Bejan says. If you’ve always wanted to take time to paint, read more books or accomplish other quarantine-friendly activities, now could be the moment.

Finding events to look forward to can be similarly helpful in passing the time, Hammond notes. Though we can’t look forward to vacations or physical outings with friends, she suggests re-creating the feeling of having plans by scheduling a virtual happy hour on Friday night or creating a Sunday afternoon film club, which you’re able to look forward to all week long. “Make the weekends different from the weekdays,” recommends Hammond.

Meditation may also be soothing for those suffering from anxiety in quarantine, Broadway suggests, saying, “It’s a really good opportunity to embrace doing nothing.” If all else fails, Bejan suggests those in quarantine “get into the habit of looking at things you were previously overlooking.” Focus on minute details — the way the trees look on your street, the way the steam floats off your tea. After a few minutes of taking your mind off the passage of time, you might be surprised to find time has a funny way of speeding up after all.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-05-01/does-it-feel-like-like-time-is-flying-by-during-coronavirus-quarantine-heres-why

If you haven’t been thinking much about climate change recently, I don’t blame you. There’s a lot of other stuff going on. But we can’t completely forget about it, either.

Even with much of the economy on lockdown, we’re still burning fossil fuels, and global temperatures are still rising. This year is shaping up to be one of the hottest on record, according to researchers at Carbon Brief, a climate science website. Drought conditions in Northern California may prompt an early start to the 2020 wildfire season — and as Californians have learned in recent years, climate change is fueling more devastating droughts and fires.

So what does this have to do with the COVID-19 pandemic? A lot, actually.

Research has found that Americans living in areas with worse air pollution — caused largely by the burning of fossil fuels — are at greater risk of dying from COVID-19 . Across the U.S., public health experts are warning that the death toll from summer heat waves could rise as millions of people self-isolate in homes they can’t keep cool. There are also economic implications, including more than 100,000 job losses in the clean energy sector and the worst oil bust in a lifetime, with prices briefly falling below zero .

The pandemic may also create new opportunities to confront climate change. Public investment in the clean energy sector, for instance, is one option for policymakers looking to rebuild the battered economy after the pandemic is over.

I asked experts what lessons from the coronavirus response might apply to climate change. Their answers included creating a health and economic safety net for communities affected by pollution, offering financial support for fossil fuel workers who lose their jobs and perhaps a renewed willingness to change our lifestyles to help others.

Across California

With Gov. Gavin Newsom announcing that some stores could open with restrictions by the end of the week as the state enters Phase Two of his plan to relax stay-at-home orders, California communities are considering what to do next.

Rural, less populated regions may reopen faster than harder-hit urban areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco. The number of infections in some rural and suburban counties is dramatically lower, with four counties having seen no cases at all, and more than a dozen reporting no deaths from the illness. Newsom on Tuesday criticized Sutter and Yuba counties for letting businesses reopen Monday against state orders as officials there argued that they were less affected. “They’re making a big mistake. They’re putting their public at risk. They’re putting our progress at risk,” Newsom said. He did not say if the state would take any action to enforce the stay-at-home order and other statewide restrictions in those counties.

L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said Monday that he did not expect retail businesses to be able to offer curbside delivery by Friday. The city’s Safer at Home order remains in effect until May 15, and Garcetti said he hoped steps restricting commerce could begin to be rolled back by then.

More Orange County beaches have been granted permission to reopen with limitations, after Newsom closed them last week to prevent weekend crowding. Under plans approved by state officials, the cities of Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Seal Beach can now open up access to their shorelines, with a range of measures to ensure safe physical distancing.

The pandemic has effectively brought much of Walt Disney Co., the world’s largest entertainment company and one of California’s biggest private employers, to a halt. Until recently, it was riding high on its dominant box office performance, packed themed parks and a fast-growing new streaming service. But Disney now says its parks segment missed out on about $1 billion in operating income in the second quarter due to coronavirus closures.

The shuttered parks could have serious implications for California’s economy because of the number of people temporarily out of work and the amount of economic activity the parks attract to the area. There are also questions about what Disney will look like when the outbreak subsides. Executive Chairman Bob Iger doesn’t “think we’re ever going to see a return to business as usual.”

Around the nation and the world

Top Trump administration health officials repeatedly ignored warnings in January and February about the need for masks and other protective equipment to prepare for the coronavirus outbreak, according to a detailed whistleblower complaint from a senior scientist ousted from his post last month. The scientist also said his skepticism about hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug touted by President Trump as a COVID-19 treatment, angered senior administration officials.

Public health officials are using antibody tests to get a more accurate picture of the virus’ spread, but businesses are also beginning to seek them out in order to bring people back to work. The tests have been touted as a way to give people so-called “immunity passports” that would allow them to work without the risk that they are contagious. But the reality is that the tests aren’t readily available, can be inaccurate and don’t tell us how much protection antibodies even provide — or for how long.

While trust in governments around the world is rising, trust in businesses — and their leaders in particular — has fallen sharply during the pandemic, according to a new report by communications firm Edelman. The survey reflects agitation among low-wage workers, including grocery store employees and delivery workers, who see too few safety protections and say their pay isn’t in line with the risk they face. “Businesses actually haven’t performed well in the minds of respondents. There’s a feeling they haven’t gotten the right products and they haven’t protected their employees — that profits are still being put over people, and more should be done to prepare for the next phase,” said Edelman’s chief executive.

As hospitals in Mexico become overloaded with patients, families are losing patience with long wait times for care and a lack of communication from medical officials. Tales of hospitals mixing up bodies have circulated on social media, leading relatives to demand to see the corpses of their loved ones to ensure they’re identified correctly. “We wanted to be sure it was my brother,” said the sister of a patient who died of COVID-19 the day after she and her family brought him to the hospital.



Your questions answered

Today’s question comes from Joseph Rys, who wants to know: Do our cars need to be disinfected? Travel editor Catharine Hamm looked into it as part of a story about what our future road trips might look like.

In order to make your car as safe as possible — whether or not you’re traveling — you should clean it. About a third of drivers clean the inside of their car only about once a year, said a futurist at Ford Motor Co. She added that the steering wheel is generally four times dirtier than a restroom.

The suggestions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers for cleaning your home can also be applied to your vehicle. Besides the steering wheel, focus on disinfecting high-touch surfaces like safety belts, door handles and even the fob you use to start the car.

Escalate the frequency of your checks on tires, oil and any equipment that could leave you stranded if it fails. That way you’re not dependent on outside rescue, which might be a vector for virus transmission. It’s also a good idea to keep a supply of masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes at the ready. Remember, the virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets and can last for hours to days on some surfaces.

"['Staff Writer', 'Kevin Baxter Covers Soccer For The Los Angeles Times', 'Where He Has Worked For Years.']",2020-05-05  ,Soccer newsletter: A settlement is best in U.S. women’s soccer pay dispute,"Hello, and welcome to another edition of the L.A. Times soccer newsletter. I’m Kevin Baxter, The Times’ soccer writer, and we’ll start today with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which won a partial victory over the women’s national team in a court of law last week but it is still getting routed in the court of public opinion.

Last Friday U.S. District Court Judge R. Gary Klausner dismissed a large part of the women’s gender-equality lawsuit, dealing a mortal blow to the team’s claim it was owned more than $66 million in damages and back pay. But that doesn’t change the fact that, for many, the reigning Women’s World Cup champions are at least underappreciated, if not underpaid, when compared to a men’s national team that didn’t even qualify for its last World Cup and has gone beyond the round of 16 just once since 1930.

So the wisest move for the federation now is to avoid spiking the football – what does it really have to celebrate anyway? – and instead approach the women with a peace offer that redresses their grievances and allows both sides to move forward together.

Fortunately in Cindy Parlow Cone, who is less than two months into her job as federation president, it has the perfect person to make that happen. And that makes an out-of-court settlement the best solution for both sides, providing it’s one that gives the women’s team a much bigger role in the federation’s business going forward, rewards them for their accomplishments and recognizes the outsized role the women’s game will have in growing soccer globally in the coming years.

Cone has been here before. She played on the 1999 World Cup-champion U.S. squad, a team that challenged U.S. Soccer with its own fight for respect and equality. Five months after winning the world title on Brandi Chastain’s penalty kick before a sold-out crowd at the Rose Bowl, the 99ers went on strike, refusing to play until the federation agreed to a collective-bargaining agreement to replace the one which expired before the World Cup victory.

Cone and her teammates were asking for an $1,850 raise, to $5,000 a month; the women today are asking to be paid on par with the men’s national team, whose players can make as much as $17,625 a game depending on the opponent and the outcome. That’s nearly double the bonus a woman player would get for a comparable result.

Advertisement

But while the numbers have changed since 1999, the argument is the same: the women aren’t getting the reward or the recognition they have earned.

Klausner didn’t opine on that, sticking instead to the legal arguments when agreeing with the federation that the collective-bargaining agreement the women negotiated in 2017 paid them more in guaranteed salary and benefits than the men get. The lawyers representing the women have promised to appeal and although the judge did allow claims of disparities in travel and medical staff to go to trial June 16 in Los Angeles, with the main argument seemingly off the table, the best way forward for both sides would be to strike a deal.

“The WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote in a 32-page opinion.

And he’s right; the women’s lawsuit was based on faulty math all along. Although it is true a male player can earn more in bonuses for one game, the women’s CBA guarantees a base salary of as much as $100,000 a year plus another $72,500 for playing in the National Women’s Soccer League, the domestic league that U.S. Soccer subsidizes. That means the federation pays the top 18 players in the national team pool $172,500, plus benefits such as medical insurance and family leave, in addition to game-day bonuses.

The men get no guaranteed salary and no benefits and must make a game-day squad to get any pay at all. But as was the case two decades ago with Cone and the 99ers, the dispute between the team and the federation is only partly about money. That the new president gets that was obvious in the carefully-worded two-sentence statement the federation released after Klausner’s decision.

“We look forward to working with the Women’s National Team to chart a positive path forward to grow the game both here at home and around the world,” it said. “U.S. Soccer has long been the world leader for the women’s game on and off the field, and we are committed to continuing that work to ensure our Women’s National Team remains the best in the world and sets the standard for women’s soccer.”

Contrast that with the language used in the federation’s legal filings two months ago when it argued that male players need “materially more strength and speed” than women players and the job of male players “carried more than responsibility” than playing for the most decorated women’s national team in history.

That’s not the way to address the most decorated national team in women’s soccer history and one of the most accomplished in all of international sports.

It was a disaster that led federation president Carlos Cordeiro to resign, paving the way for Cone to become the first women to lead U.S. Soccer in the federation’s 107 years and her accension couldn’t have come at a better time. Not only has she been a victim of the federation’s unequal practices, she was also part of a team that fought against them, which gives her a visceral understanding the issues at play and the credibility to solve them.

Despite her federation’s win in court Cone knows the arc of justice bends toward the women, who clearly have the public on their side. Jersey sales, TV ratings and attendance for the women eclipse the men across the board. Of more importance for U.S. Soccer’s bottom line is the fact major sponsors, including Coca-Cola Co., Anheuser Busch, Procter & Gamble and Volkswagen have also rallied to the women’s side.

Last year U.S. Soccer offered the women $9 million to settle their lawsuit; the players want more than $66 million. That’s a big gap to bridge but the women themselves have hinted at a way forward, publicly conceding that equal pay is a complex concept. That’s an argument with which Cone undoubtedly agrees and it gives the sides a starting point to begin a new way forward.

The players have said repeatedly they are fighting for future generations so what if the women’s national team was offered increased representation on the U.S. Soccer board of governors? What if they were given enough seats at the decision-making table to ensure real progress is made not only on the national level but in youth development and in spending at all levels?

Advertisement

What if U.S. Soccer adopted a platform that included pressuring FIFA to address global inequalities in soccer? Fifty-one FIFA members don’t even field a women’s team and the vast, vast majority of those that do spend very little on their women’s program. What if U.S. pledged to pressure FIFA to change that, requiring all members to support women’s soccer and fund it at a baseline level?

When France won the men’s World Cup in 2018 it took home $38 million from a total prize-money purse of $400 million. When the U.S. won the Women’s World Cup last summer it got $4 million from a total purse of $30 million. FIFA must change that too and if the argument is the men’s tournament brings in more money – which it does – then move some of that revenue over to fund the women’s competition.

That kind of revenue sharing has made Title IX work and the growth that has meant to women’s programs has greatly benefited all college sports, regardless of gender.

It would work for FIFA as well. If FIFA can be persuaded to engage half the planet’s population instead of marginalizing it, it might be surprised how much the global game can still grow.

Advertisement

Last week’s court ruling shouldn’t be seen as a loss for the women’s team nor as a win for the federation. Instead it represents an opportunity for both sides to get beyond the animosity that has built up since Cone’s playing days, paving the way for Cone the president to usher in the kind of advances she and her teammates must have envisioned when they went on strike two decades ago.

Is opening of training facilities the start of an MLS return?

MLS will allow players to access team training facilities Wednesday for the first time since March 13, although there are more caveats and restrictions to that reopening than there is in the fine print of a mobile-phone contract.

Players must train alone, outdoors, in a predesignated quadrant of the training field, for example. They cannot use locker rooms, team gyms, restrooms and other facilities. The workouts are considered voluntary and they cannot conflict with local public health or government restrictions.

Additionally, teams must submit a specific plan to the league explaining how they will sanitize and disinfect all equipment after each session, how they will screen players for COVID-19 as well as how they will stagger player and staff arrivals and departures to allow social-distancing measures to be enforced. Players must also dress at home and wear personal protective gear on their walks to and from the training field.

Yet despite all that, this probably represents an unsteady first step back toward some semblance of normalcy.

A day after suspending its season in early March, MLS placed a moratorium on the use of team facilities, exempting only players who required specific treatment for an injury. That moratorium has been extended five times through May 15. And while practice sessions of two or more players remain prohibited, the league made a commonsense call to open practice fields in controlled conditions amid growing concerns that players were endangering themselves training in parks and other public venues where there were limited safeguards against the spread of COVID-19.

So I’m going to be optimistic here and say the unlocking of training facilities – even under draconian restrictions – is a sign of progress.

The league, after all, is still hopeful of completing a full 34-game schedule, even if that means playing the 2020 MLS Cup final early next year. One option discussed would have teams return to play in empty stadiums, but that would be costly since the league says ticket revenue, along with corporate sponsorships, is its largest source of revenue.

Exactly what the next step is isn’t clear, even to the players.

“I just don’t think it’s that easy, really,” Galaxy defender Daniel Steres said during an appearance on the Corner of the Galaxy podcast last week. “Even trying to do a closed-door thing, you have to go to a single location and wherever that may be, there can’t be more spread of the virus there.

“Then you have to put us in a hotel that’s got to be essentially locked down. You can’t have any touch with the outside world. That’s nearly impossible.”

Steres said he’s trying to remain optimistic about the possibility of restarting the season soon, but he’s pessimistic about exactly how that would happen. California, he noted, remains under lockdown while other states with MLS teams, such as Florida, Georgia and Texas, have reopened. And once games resume, what would happen if players test positive? Would teams have to play with smaller rosters, perhaps without designated players, or would the schedule be paused again?

“I want to get back to playing. I want to get back to training. It’s just tough for me to see an easy or good way to do it,” he said. “That you can just, as a fan or anyone, be like ‘yeah, let’s just do that’; I think they’re kind of racking their brains for anything they can possibility come up with at this point.”

Whatever the solution, Steres said it’s unlikely to satisfy everybody. So even if MLS is able to crown a champion for its 25th anniversary season, it will always carry an asterisk.

“Any team [that] gets to the end of the road, the other teams might be looking at them like ‘ah, it was 2020. It was that year’,” he said.

Assuming MLS resumes play at some point, the pause in the schedule might actually work to Steres’ benefit. After leading the Galaxy in minutes played in two of the last four seasons, the defender sat out the first two games this year with a groin injury. The break has helped that heal.

“That’s been my main focus during this quarantine time,” he said. “I can’t sit here and say just resting has completely gotten rid of everything, which is a little unfortunate. But we’re getting there, we’re getting close.”

So, perhaps, is MLS.

European leagues also stuck for COVID-19 response

MLS isn’t the only first-division league struggling to find a way forward during the coronavirus pandemic. In the last week Belgium, France and Argentina joined the Netherlands in deciding to shut down their seasons while major decisions still loom in Germany, England, Spain and Italy.

After the U.S., Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Belgium and Germany rank second through seventh in terms of reported COVID-19 fatalities, combing for nearly half the deaths worldwide. So authorities there have more than soccer to consider when it comes to reopening stadiums.

The French ruled against the resumption of fun and games last week, blocking plans for the country’s top two men’s leagues and its top women’s league to restart play. Paris Saint-Germain, which led second-place Marseille by 12 points with 11 games to play, was declared the Ligue 1 champion and with the rest of the standings also frozen in place, Frank McCourt’s Marseille, in second place, qualifies for the Champions League for the first time since 2013-14 while Rennes and Lille get the league’s other two European tournament spots.

At the bottom of the table last-place Toulouse and 19th-place Amiens were relegated while second-division leader Lorient and second-place Lens were promoted.

In Argentina, Boca Juniors were declared champions over Buenos Aires rival River Plate after the season’s final 11 games were canceled.

The Bundesliga, meanwhile, was hopeful of restarting its season May 9 but that date was pushed back when the German government delayed action on approving the league’s request to resume play until later this week. Chancellor Angela Merkel began easing lockdown measures across the country in late April only to be met by concerns over a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, leading some health experts to question the return to soccer.

Complicating matters further was the announcement that two players and a trainer at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus.

In England the government and Premier League officials are discussing ways to restart the EPL season in June and the play the final 92 games on the schedule, most likely at neutral sites behind locked doors. But after a 3 ½-hour video conference between team representatives Friday, the Guardian reported at least one participant came away feeling the obstacles the league was facing were too great to overcome. Discussions will continue this week; the league is facing as much as $1.25 billion in lost revenue if the season does not resume, according to chief executive Richard Masters.

In Spain, the government has approved a protocol for sporting activity to resume and teams began testing players for COVID-19 on Tuesday in the hopes of resuming training sessions next week. The league wants to restart the La Liga season in mid-June.

In Italy, Serie A clubs were expected to resume training this week after voting in a conference call to resume the season, perhaps as early as next month, They, too, will need government approval before games can be held.

In Portugal clubs returned to the training fields Monday with the government’s blessing for the first time in nearly two months. The Primeira Liga is scheduled to restart on May 30.

Amid growing pressure to ease a stay-at-home order that has cratered the California economy, Gov. Gavin Newsom took to the podium for his daily briefing on Monday and made a major announcement: The state will begin “reopening” this week, with some retail stores getting back to business as early as Friday, albeit with modifications.

[Read the story: “Gov. Gavin Newsom says reopening California will begin this week amid coronavirus crisis” in the Los Angeles Times]

But before you hire that celebratory marching band, remember that reopening the nation’s most populous state will be a slow process. Californians can expect change to happen incrementally over a series of months, following a four-stage blueprint for easing restrictions that the governor laid out last week.

What’s happening this week

Bookstores, music stores, toy stores, florists, clothing stores, sporting goods retailers and others will be eligible to reopen for pickup beginning Friday, provided that the businesses make modifications to meet state guidelines. Manufacturing and logistics for the retail supply chain will also be able to resume.

How all of this fits into the broader plan

Think of each stage of Newsom’s plan as a stretch of highway with various landmarks along the way, rather than a single discrete destination. The state will begin moving into the second phase of the four-stage plan this week, but not all aspects will happen at once. Shopping malls, dine-in restaurants and offices where telework is possible have also been categorized as part of Stage 2, but they will reopen later. Officials have also said that restrictions will be continually assessed and could be modified based on regional health conditions, including testing capabilities.

What else you need to know

Rural Californians who’ve been agitating for a faster timetable for loosening restrictions in their communities (or, in some cases, defying those restrictions altogether) will probably welcome the other major announcement from Monday’s briefing. Newsom said that he would allow for regional variation as the plan moves forward, with expanded decision-making at the local level. Some communities will be able to move further ahead into the second phase of the reopening process at their own pace and open more businesses — such as restaurant dining rooms — beyond those outlined in the statewide policy. But if communities want to take that next step, counties must first submit “containment plans” that meet certain requirements for hospital beds, testing kits and the ability to track infected people and trace their contacts.

And now, here’s what’s happening across California:

Amid an outbreak at one of its stores in Southern California, the largest U.S. grocery chain has announced it will provide free coronavirus testing for all its frontline associates who have symptoms or medical needs that make them eligible for testing under guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kroger, which operates multiple supermarket chains, including Kroger, Ralphs and Food4Less, said it will begin offering the testing this month through its healthcare division, Kroger Health. The announcement comes as an outbreak at a Ralphs in Hollywood marks the largest cluster of infections at a retail store recorded by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Twenty-one employees of the Sunset Boulevard grocery store’s 158 employees have tested positive for the virus. Los Angeles Times

Today’s California memory comes from Kathleen Harrison:

I was raised on Catalina Island in the 1950s. All our parents served the summer tourism that kept us afloat, but from Labor Day to Memorial Day the island was ours. Despite summertime joys, quiet winters felt more magical. In a golden era for kids, we had freedom to roam, both in and out of the ocean, then we started working too. I’ve returned lifelong, to ‘skin dive’ the undersea gardens and hike the hills.

La señora de tan solo 35 años de edad, ha pasado más de un mes con la enfermedad de COVID19 y aún sigue delicada de salud y sin poder acercarse a sus hijos.

Aída y su esposo Jorge fueron diagnosticados el pasado 29 de marzo. Ambos residentes de Lincoln Heights empezaron a sentir al mismo tiempo los síntomas principales de la enfermedad: tos, dolor de cuerpo y fiebre.

Bastó una llamada por teléfono a su doctor para que este le dijera a la madre que ella y su esposo tenían que aislarse de inmediato porque tenían coronavirus.

El aislamiento significaría que su hija Leidy, de 20 años de edad, y quien trabaja como cajera en la cadena de tiendas Superior, tendría que hacerse cargo del resto de sus hermanitos de 14, 13, 2 años y un bebé de cinco meses de edad.

El pánico se apoderó de Aída, así como de Jorge, pero la travesía con la nueva enfermedad fue diferente para los dos. Su esposo recobró la salud a los 15 días de enfermarse e incluso pudo regresar a trabajar en una imprenta, pero ella siguió débil al punto de tomar el teléfono y despedirse a través de un texto.

Sin poder recuperarse, la señora decidió hacerse la prueba el 17 de abril, y dos días después le dijeron que su doctor de cabecera estaba en lo correcto. Ella resultó positiva para el coronavirus.

Hasta hoy en día, Aída sigue con lo síntomas, ya no tan fuertes como antes, pero el pensamiento de poder morir merodea su cabeza, al mismo tiempo que su voz interna le dice que tiene que ser fuerte para sus hijos.

Cuando la Organización Mundial de la Salud declaró el coronavirus como una pandemia, ella se apresuró a abastecerme de alimento para sus hijos. Ya para entonces muchas tiendas estaban vacías así que iba a diferentes y agarraba lo que podía, dice la señora.

“No supimos cómo nos contagiamos, pero mientras mi esposo tenía los síntomas leves, a mí me atacó a la enfermedad por completo”, sostiene.

La oriunda de México experimentó diarrea, escalofríos, náuseas, congestión en el pecho y la nariz los primeros 12 días. Sin embargo, el dolor de pecho y cuerpo eran tan extremos que llegó el momento en que no podía ni siquiera moverse o hablar. Su única opción era respirar por la boca.

“Hubo momentos en que era tanto el dolor y la falta de aire que quería llamarle a una ambulancia, pero me quedaba pensando en mis hijos… y pensaba que, si llegaba al hospital, ya no iba a salir de ahí”, dice Aída.

En una ocasión, sin poder hablar o sentir brazos y piernas, Aída tomó la decisión de despedirse, pero sin alarmar a su hija mas grande.

“Cogí el teléfono, eran las 3 de la mañana y le escribí a mi hija un texto… le dije: ‘necesito que seas fuerte porque no puedo respirar, tus hermanos te necesitan y quiero que los cuides si tengo que irme’…”, dice Aída.

La madre de familia sostiene que estaba consciente de que uno de sus hijos de 14 años sufre de ansiedad, y verla enferma y quejándose era peor para él.

“Entonces tomaba fuerzas para no terminar en el hospital. Luego pensaba en el cargo que le iba a dejar a mi hija mas grande, y enseguida se venían mis hijos más pequeños a la cabeza”, dice Aída. “Al final de cuentas todos ellos necesitan una madre”.

Durante todo este tiempo, Leydi, la hija mayor de Aída dejó de trabajar y estuvo a cargo de cuidar a su madre y hermanos más pequeños mientras el padre salía a trabajar.

“Aprendí ha hacer de comer por medio de YouTube y también aprendí a cambiar pañales y bañar a mi hermanito mas chico”, dice la joven entre sonrisas.

“Esta experiencia ha sido dura para mi familia. Hemos visto como mis padres han sufrido, en especial mi mamá, pero sabemos que muchas familias están experimentando lo mismo que nosotros. Lo único que quiero es que mi mamá este bien de salud”, dice la joven.

Aída por su parte le agradece a su hija lo que ha hecho por la familia entera y enfatiza que sus hijos le están salvando la vida.

“Uno debe de agarrar fuerzas y tener fe en Dios en que las cosas van a estar bien a pesar de los malos pensamientos que puedan venir con esto. He aprendido más que nunca que la familia es lo más importante”, dice Aída.

He Also Appears Daily On Ktla Channel His Work Runs In Newspapers Across The Country', 'Has Resulted In A Variety Of Laws Protecting Consumers.']",2020-05-05  ,Column: What do you do if a business furloughs everyone you need to speak with?,"Nobody likes dealing with problems in their credit files. It can be a lengthy, laborious process involving lots of documents and calls to multiple companies and credit agencies.

That situation may now be even worse thanks to coronavirus business closures.

Carol Scott, 70, discovered this after recently attempting to resolve an “adverse report” placed on one of her credit files by Macy’s over an accidentally late payment.

The Sherman Oaks lawyer said the issue came to light as she was seeking a small-business loan to keep her practice afloat. The adverse report from Macy’s branded her a credit risk, prompting lenders to halt her loan applications.

Scott told me she had to make repeated calls to Macy’s before she finally reached a supervisor who would address the issue.

“The supervisor said there was nothing they could do,” she recalled. “She said they’d furloughed the entire dispute-resolution department and I’d have to wait until it reopened, maybe in May, maybe later.”

Which is to say, too bad about your credit file, but you’re on your own.

OK, a couple of thoughts immediately come to mind.

First, Macy’s is by no means alone in temporarily (or permanently) telling employees not to report for work. Many businesses have resorted to similar measures to help weather the coronavirus storm.

Second, what do Macy’s and other consumer-focused companies expect customers to do when troubles such as this arise?

“There is no excuse for harming people’s credit standing in these uncertain financial times,” said Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group Consumer Action.

I asked Macy’s about Scott’s situation. The company responded with a brief, two-sentence statement. I’ll get back to that.

Macy’s announced at the end of March that it was furloughing most of its 125,000 employees because of the pandemic, which had forced it to close all of its 775 stores.

The company said it was “moving to the absolute minimum workforce needed to maintain basic operations. This means the majority of our colleagues will go on furlough.”

Similar moves were announced by Nordstrom, JCPenney, Kohl’s, Gap, Best Buy and other prominent retailers.

Macy’s said last week that it plans to gradually reopen its stores over the next six to eight weeks.

All retailers are anxious to turn things around. Stay-at-home orders nationwide resulted in an 8.7% drop in March retail sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau . That’s the biggest monthly decline ever recorded.

On Monday, preppy-clothes maven J. Crew filed for bankruptcy protection — the first major retailer to do so since the pandemic erupted.

“March was a month that started out with many stores still open, but far more are closed now,” said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation. “Don’t be surprised if the data going forward show a worsening situation.”

Even so, business continues. Most retailers are still operating online, which means they’re still processing credit card payments and monthly bills.

Advertisement

Which means issues can arise if something goes wrong.

Yet Scott said she hit a brick wall while seeking help from Macy’s in addressing her snafu, which involved a Macy’s store card.

“They kept saying there was nothing they could do while everyone was furloughed,” she told me. “They couldn’t even say which government agencies I should turn to.”

That would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, both of which are charged with making sure consumers aren’t taken advantage of in their financial dealings.

Advertisement

I reached out to the two agencies. The CFPB didn’t respond (wake up, guys!), but a spokeswoman for the FTC said consumers can turn to the commission for information on disputing errors in credit files and to lodge a complaint.

I also contacted the three leading credit bureaus — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — for advice on what consumers should do if a business can’t or won’t step up to help resolve a dispute.

“Consumers can request a current copy of their credit reports from each of the national credit reporting companies for free,” said Sandra Bernardo, an Experian spokeswoman. “Doing so will enable consumers to verify their accounts and any activity, such as late payments, reported by their lenders.”

Each credit bureau has its own system for disputing problems, she said. Typically, such matters can be taken up online.

Advertisement

In Scott’s case, Bernardo said, “the consumer needs to check her Experian credit report, and if there is a late payment reported by Macy’s, she can initiate a dispute.”

But that’s just the start.

“It’s important to remember that disputing information with one credit bureau may not impact information on credit reports from the other two bureaus,” said Zehra Mehdi-Barlas, an Equifax spokeswoman.

If this sounds time-consuming, it is. I spent many hours restoring order to my own credit files after an ugly episode of identity theft. It’s quite a production.

So what did Macy’s have to say? A spokesperson said by email that “we are working with our customers to address their individual situations,” which suggests Scott isn’t the only one facing difficulties.

“If a customer has a question specifically on credit reporting, we instruct them to write to a monitored address — this team is not furloughed and is actively reviewing cases,” the spokesperson said.

I replied that Scott said she spoke with multiple Macy’s service reps, and not one instructed her to reach the unfurloughed team via a “monitored” email address.

“As it relates to this case, we apologize for any confusion,” the spokesperson wrote back. “We have increased awareness of this matter to support our agents and improve [the] customer experience.”

I asked why Macy’s is reporting late payments to credit agencies during a public health crisis. No answer.

I asked for the monitored email address so I could share it with other customers. No reply.

Weirdest of all, the spokesperson didn’t request Scott’s name or contact information. The company, apparently, wasn’t interested in pursuing the matter.

“If Macy’s still has the staff capacity to sell products online and place adverse reports on consumers’ credit files, then they should also have the staff capacity to handle disputes, too,” said Emily Rusch, executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05  ,Prosecutor: Grand jury to weigh charges in Georgia shooting of black man by two white men,"A Georgia prosecutor said Tuesday that he wants a grand jury to decide whether criminal charges are warranted in the death of a man shot after a pursuit by armed men who later told police they suspected him of being a burglar.

Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was killed Feb. 23 in a neighborhood outside the coastal port city of Brunswick. No one has been arrested or charged in the case, prompting an outcry from the local NAACP and others. Arbery was black and the men who chased him are white.

“All I want to do is get justice for my son,” said Marcus Arbery, the slain man’s father, who believes his son was out jogging when he was killed. “This is terrible. It could happen to anybody’s kid.”

The announcement that a grand jury will review the case came as an attorney for Arbery’s mother posted a cellphone video on Twitter that he said shows the shooting. “This is murder,” lawyer Lee Merritt said.

“Mr. Arbery had not committed any crime and there was no reason for these men to believe they had the right to stop him with weapons or to use deadly force in furtherance of their unlawful attempted stop,” said a statement by Merritt, who represents Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper.

Tom Durden, an outside prosecutor assigned to examine the case, said he plans to have a grand jury hear the evidence in the shooting. That won’t happen for more than a month, as Georgia courts remain largely closed because of the coronavirus outbreak until at least June 13.

“I am of the opinion that the case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn County for consideration of criminal charges against those involved in the death of Mr. Arbery,” Durden said in a statement Tuesday.

Reached by phone, Durden said no arrests have been made in connection with the shooting. He declined to say what charges he would have a grand jury consider.

The cellphone video, initially posted by a Brunswick radio station, shows a black man running at a jogging pace on the left side of a two-lane road. A truck is parked in the road ahead of him, with one man in the pickup bed and another standing beside the open driver’s side door.

The runner crosses the road to pass the pickup on the passenger side, then crosses back in front of the truck. A gunshot sounds, and the video shows the runner grappling with a man in the street over what appears to be a shotgun or rifle. A second shot can be heard and the runner can be seen punching the man. A third shot is fired at point-blank range. The runner staggers a few feet and falls face down.

“I think the video is very clear that they were on the truck with guns hunting him down,” said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Arbery’s father. “I don’t know what more you need to make an arrest.”

Durden declined to comment Tuesday when the prosecutor was asked whether he could verify that the video showed the shooting of Arbery.

According to an incident report filed by Glynn County police, Arbery was shot Feb. 23 after two men spotted him running in their neighborhood and armed themselves with guns before getting in a truck to pursue him. Gregory McMichael told police that he and his adult son, Travis, thought the young man matched someone caught on a security camera committing a recent break-in in the neighborhood.

According to his father, Arbery didn’t live far from the Satilla Shores neighborhood where the McMichaels gave chase after spotting him on a Sunday afternoon.

The police report says Gregory McMichael told officers he and his son first tried to stop Arbery by shouting, “Stop, stop, we want to talk to you!”

McMichael said his son got out of the truck and Arbery “began to violently attack” him and “the two men then started fighting over the shotgun,” the police report said.

The police report says Gregory McMichael turned Arbery onto his back to see if he was armed — but the report doesn’t say whether he had a weapon or not.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based civil rights group, has demanded the U.S. Justice Department investigate.

A phone number listed for Gregory McMichael has been disconnected. The Associated Press could not immediately find a phone listing for Travis McMichael.

Jackie Johnson, the district attorney for Glynn County, recused herself from the case because Gregory McMichael worked as an investigator in her office. He retired a year ago.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-05/prosecutor-grand-jury-to-weigh-charges-in-georgia-shooting
"['Staff Writer', 'Victoria Kim Is The Seoul Correspondent For The Los Angeles Times. She Previously Covered State', 'Federal Courts', 'Worked On Investigative Projects', 'Reported On Southern California S Korean Community.']",2020-05-05  ,Missing Major League Baseball? Here’s Korean baseball to the rescue,"Former U.S. major league player Kim Hyun-soo sent the ball cracking over the left-field fence, marking the first home run of the long-awaited season of South Korea’s beloved baseball league.

But instead of basking in thunderous applause and hollers from adoring fans, Kim loped across home plate to a smattering of claps from a few dozen reporters and league employees. After scoring two runs for his Seoul-based LG Twins, Kim approached a teammate who waited with his arms up, but caught himself at the last second, narrowly avoiding a high-five — banned by the league as a coronavirus precaution. He bumped elbows with another teammate.

Most of the stadium’s 25,553 seats — a tough get in a normal year for a game between the Twins and archrival Doosan Bears — were empty.

Baseball returned to South Korea under drizzly and overcast skies Tuesday, a rare professional sporting league to resume games while much of the world remains under lockdown with no end in sight to the COVID-19 pandemic. The five-game opening day showed South Korea testing the waters for a cautious return to normalcy on a day the country reported just three new cases of the coronavirus, a sign that the virus’ community spread has largely been halted.

With ESPN reaching an eleventh-hour deal to broadcast Korea Baseball Organization games, a host of U.S. fans starved for live sports were turning to the Korean league, with its distinct culture and avid fandom. Taiwan’s Chinese Professional Baseball League, which started up April 11, has also gained a following among Americans watching online.

“Major League Baseball teams [in the U.S.] are more corporate, a little more sterile, not as passionate. The KBO feels like a college football game,” said Dan Kurtz, a longtime fan behind the site MyKBO.net. Kurtz said he was being inundated with messages from sports-deprived Americans in the lead-up to the season. “The KBO is going to fill that void, and that’s awesome.”

The 144-game season, originally set to begin in late March, was pushed back a few times before getting underway with a number of precautions. A 44-page manual distributed to the league’s 10 teams outlined detailed protocols — including bans on high-fives and spitting, and the minimizing of player contact with the general public. All games will initially be conducted without spectators; the league has said it will consider phasing in a limited of number of fans at a later date.

On the field in Seoul’s Jamsil Baseball Stadium on Tuesday, umpires and base coaches wore masks and gloves. The mascot for the home-team Twins — twin robot boys named Lucky and Star — also wore masks, as did the team’s cheerleaders and a drum squad that did its best to make up for the absence of fans. When they fell silent, an uncanny hush blanketed the stadium, interrupted only by the whiz of nearby traffic and the satisfying thwack of hits.

The quiet was especially odd in a stadium typically filled with songs and chants customized to each hitter and situation and boisterously belted out by fervent fans throughout the game.

“Without them, it’s a totally different animal,” said Twins pitcher Tyler Wilson, formerly of the Baltimore Orioles, who has been playing in South Korea since 2018. “Their energy and their passion and how into it they are, from the first pitch to the end, is what makes the games so special.”

Wilson, who didn’t play in Tuesday’s opening game, said that, during this year’s pre-season games, it was so quiet he could hear the broadcasters’ commentary, conversations in the field and in the dugout, and even the sound of his own spikes going into the dirt.

Precautions began long before opening day. Former Angels catcher Hank Conger, starting his first season as a battery coach with the Busan-based Lotte Giants, said players had been dining with plexiglass barriers between them in the lunchroom and wearing masks on the bus. Former teammates in the U.S. were eyeing the situation in Korea enviously, he said.

“For us to finally start is surreal,” he said. “Everybody sees my Instagram and sees us getting ready for the season, and they’re saying, ‘I can’t believe you guys are playing.’”

Kim Tae-hyoung, the manager of the defending champions, the Doosan Bears, told reporters he wasn’t quite sure how the coronavirus-related measures and delays would affect his team, but at the end of the day, he just wanted to win.

“This is a first for me too,” he said.

A reporter asked if he had remarks for viewers from the U.S. watching KBO games for the first time.

“Do I have to say that in English?” he said, to laughs. “Give us a lot of love please.”

Outside the closed stadium gates, 25-year-old Kim Gwang-ho was among a handful of fans who showed up wearing team hats and jerseys. The longtime Twins fan watched the game on his cellphone while listening to what sounds he could make out over the stadium walls — and he was hoping for a selfie with a player after the game.

“I hope this corona situation ends so everyone can come and cheer them on, in time for fall baseball,” he said. “I hope they win the Korean series this year.”

After pulling ahead with Kim Hyun-soo’s early home run, the Twins beat the Bears 8-2. By the end of the nearly three-hour game, gray skies had given way to a picture-perfect sunny day.

Kurtz of MyKBO.net, who is a Bears fan, said all of Korean baseball and its fans scored a win Tuesday with the international attention being paid to a league normally overshadowed by U.S. Major League Baseball. He said he hoped the country’s overlooked sports would receive some of the acclaim its music and movies had been getting of late.

"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05  ,"Europe’s first coronavirus case may have been in December, weeks earlier than previously thought","French scientists say they may have identified a possible case of the coronavirus dating back to December — about a month before the first cases were officially confirmed in Europe.

In a study published in the International Journal of Microbial Agents, doctors at a hospital north of Paris reviewed retrospective samples of 14 patients treated for atypical pneumonia between early December and mid-January. Among those were the records of Amirouche Hammar, a fishmonger in his 40s from Algeria who has lived in France for years and had no recent travel history.

Hammar told French broadcaster BFM-TV on Tuesday that he drove himself to a hospital emergency unit at 5 a.m. one morning in late December because he felt very sick, with chest pains and breathing difficulties.

“They said, ‘Perhaps you have an infection, a pulmonary infection, although it’s not certain. But what you have is very serious, very serious, because you are coughing blood. It’s not normal flu,’” he said.

Hammar was admitted to the hospital with symptoms doctors say were consistent with COVID-19 patients in China and Italy. One of his children had also gotten sick with an unusual pneumonia shortly before Hammar fell ill. When doctors retested Hammar’s old sample, they found it was positive for the coronavirus.

“Identifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge” regarding the spread of the coronavirus, wrote Dr. Yves Cohen, one of the French researchers. An intensive care specialist, Cohen works in the northern suburbs of Paris where Hammar lives and which have been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 infections and deaths.

Cohen told BFM-TV that when Hammar sought treatment in December, they figured he was simply suffering from a form of viral pneumonia that they couldn’t put their finger on. “We told ourselves, ‘It’s a virus that we haven’t discovered,’ but we stopped there.”

There doesn’t appear to have been any further transmission of the virus from Hammar, who later recovered after being treated with antibiotics in the ICU. Cohen and colleagues suggested their results showed there could be many other unidentified coronavirus cases from before the disease was officially detected in Europe.

Still, the scientists acknowledged that because the study, which was published online Sunday, was done retrospectively, “medical records were not exhaustive and some relevant information might have been missing.”

Other experts said the results were interesting, but hardly conclusive.

Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham in England, said it was possible the results were due to lab contamination.

“If he was infected [with COVID-19], then you would expect a more rapid and earlier spread of the virus in France than was seen,” he said in a statement. Ball wasn’t connected to the published study.

“Sequencing any virus in the sample might give you insight into whether or not the virus truly was an early isolate or likely contamination, but it looks from the data that the amount of virus in the sample was low, so would be difficult to analyze further,” he said.

Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh in the Scottish capital, said it was possible that in the early days of the disease’s emergence, there were many instances in which infected people traveled around the world but that the virus wasn’t spread any further.

1. Support your local Mexican restaurant. Obviously.

Although 2020 may not seem to have a whole lot going for it, this year is one of those rare occurrences when Cinco de Mayo falls on Taco Tuesday.

Although most businesses are closed, chances are your favorite local spot for tacos, tamales or taquitos is still open. If it’s not, branch out and try one of the 20 Mexican restaurants offering delivery or takeout to which our restaurant critic Bill Addison gave his stamp of approval.

Cinco de Mayo is usually a boon for locally owned Mexican restaurants, and those that are still open could use the boost in revenue.

If you do go out to pick up food, don’t forget to wear a mask — you can buy one from these quinceañera dressmakers who are out of work.

If you feel safer at home, there are plenty of delicious Mexican dishes you can make in your own kitchen.



2. Read up on the Battle of Puebla.

No, Cinco de Mayo is not Mexican Independence Day. That’s in September.

But it is a popularly celebrated Mexican holiday — just mostly outside of Mexico. It commemorates the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, when the Mexican military trounced a French army at Puebla, the city the French were traveling through to reach Mexico City with plans to establish a satellite state. Although the French returned in full force the following year, the 1862 triumph marked a decisive victory for the Mexican military at the time.

The United States’ celebrations of the historic victory really took off in the mid 20th century, probably when alcohol companies began using it in promotions. Puebla is one of the few places in Mexico that still highlights the holiday, usually putting on a 19th century battle reenactment and a parade across the city.

While you’re researching, consider marking your calendar for Sept. 16 — the real Mexican Independence Day.



3. Take a Spanish lesson.

If you’ve been twiddling your thumbs, you might as well put them to good use while your tongue gets twisted learning a new language.

Duolingo’s language courses are free, but several other platforms, including Babbel and Rosetta Stone, offer interactive games and lessons.

You could also join the free language-exchange websites Conversation Exchange or My Language Exchange and practice your Spanish with native speakers who might teach you about the history of Cinco de Mayo via email, chat or Skype.



4. Support mariachis.

Whatever you decide to do, tune into some mariachi music while you’re doing it. The coronavirus decimated events where mariachi musicians would typically play, cutting off their source of income and inspiring some to play at Mariachi Plaza last month, asking Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for more economic support.

To honor the work of its musicians, the Mariachi Heritage Foundation, along with salsa maker Chi-Chi’s, is putting on a daylong virtual mariachi festival it’s calling “Singo de Mayo.”

Private 30-minute mariachi sessions filled up fast, so tune in to the live happy hour concert Tuesday evening.

5. Donate to cultural centers.

Museums, art galleries and cultural centers are struggling, and even small donations may help keep them alive until their doors reopen. There are several worthy recipients of your Cinco de Mayo dollars in California — such as the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach or the Mexican Cultural Center of Northern California .

Whichever institution you choose, take a moment while you’re on their website to visit some online exhibitions.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-05-05/5-ways-to-celebrate-cinco-de-mayo-at-home

Don’t despair; travel won’t be off-limits forever. Here are some things that can help you navigate these difficult times and plan for the future.



1. Can I get a travel refund?

There are as many answers to this question as there are things to do in the world.

Airlines: Each airline conducts its business differently. Many airlines now are more liberal than usual if you decide to change your flight, sometimes waiving change fees.

If the airline cancels the flight, under most circumstances it will try to accommodate you. If it can’t within the time it specifies, it may give you a voucher or a refund. Don’t be surprised if the airline mentions the voucher first or doesn’t mention the refund at all (unless it’s Southwest). If its website or agent doesn’t mention a refund for a flight it canceled, ask and ask again. Not all are forthcoming about refunds. Read more about airline refunds at lat.ms/airlinerefundscredits.

Cruise lines: Cruise lines worldwide suspended sailings March 13 as the coronavirus pandemic spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 9 extended the no-sail order for cruise ships in the U.S., with no firm return date announced. Carnival, Disney and other cruise lines are pushing back their return-to-service dates and canceling more trips. You can get a refund or a future cruise credit, which usually comes with perks and credits to keep you on board. Read more about cruise policies at lat.ms/cruiserefundscredits.

Other travel: Here’s good news if you have or make Amtrak reservations before May 31: If you cancel your ticket and want a refund, you can get one. The only catch: You must call (800) 872-7245. The refund cannot be completed on Amtrak.com or the Amtrak app. Amtrak is also waiving change fees for reservations before the end of May. Reservations may be modified by phone, Amtrak.com or the app.

Travelers holding Disneyland tickets for a date when the theme park is closed won’t get a refund, but they may postpone their visit. For information, go to lat.ms/disneycoronatickets.

2. What about my elite status with my airline’s loyalty program?

Airlines want you back. Really. U.S. carriers have allowed passengers to change or cancel flights without penalty fees during the coronavirus pandemic. Some are giving elite members of their loyalty programs automatic extensions of their status — some as long as 18 months. For example, American Airlines recently announced it would reward AAdvantage members by granting an automatic extension of their status until Jan. 31, 2022. Members can expect to see the change reflected in their accounts on May 15. The airline also lowered the qualifications for elite status. Here are more loyalty program details at lat.ms/airlineloyaltyrewards.



3. Can I go to Hawaii as planned?

Hawaii doubled down on its stay-at home order April 25. With Georgia and a few other states easing restrictions, Gov. David Ige went in the opposite direction. To stop the spread of coronavirus, he extended the state’s stay-at-home order until May 31. The order closed state parks and monuments, historical sites, recreation areas and many businesses. Ige’s order extended mandatory quarantine rules too. Anyone flying to the islands will have to quarantine at home or at their hotel for 14 days.



4. Should I travel at all in the U.S. right now?

The short answer: It’s up to you. Of course, the real answer is more complicated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually doesn’t give travel advice, but the agency’s website (lat.ms/cdctravelguidelines) devotes an entire page to questions and factors to consider. The California Department of Public Health follows those same guidelines.

You need to weigh whether you are putting yourself or others at risk. Are you sick or do you have underlying health conditions? You probably shouldn’t be traveling and increasing your risk of getting the disease. Is your travel urgent? Every U.S. state has confirmed cases of COVID-19. “This whole [novel coronavirus] problem is evolving. Look where we were two months ago,” said Dr. Robert Winters, an infectious disease specialist in Santa Monica. Bottom line: We don’t know what we don’t know about the novel coronavirus.

5. Should I make plans for a summer vacation?

Maybe. There are incredible travel deals right now, from airfares to rafting trips, and that trend probably will continue as the tourism industry acts to recover pandemic losses. If you book, it’s possible you may be financially protected in a way you have not been. Refunds are more plentiful, but so are problems. And the issue of refunds continues to evolve, as have polices and practices that determine whether you get back your money, a credit or nothing at all. Here’s a guide atlat.ms/summervacationplans to help you decide whether to take a chance and be rewarded with good value or take a chance and suffer a financial loss.

6. Can I renew my U.S. passport?

The U.S. State Department is not processing new passports and renewals except for emergency cases because of the coronavirus pandemic. As of March 20, “we are only able to offer service for customers with a qualified life-or-death emergency and who need a passport for immediate international travel within 72 hours,” the agency’s website says. Americans are being asked to wait to apply or renew until the agency resumes “normal operations.” If you already sent in your passport for renewal, you can expect significant delays.



7. I’m sick of working from home. Where else can I go?

Some Southern California luxury hotels will let you set up your virtual office for a day without having to stay overnight. For example, Paséa Hotel & Spa in Huntington Beach is offering Office Zen rooms for weekday use from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., starting at $69. You can spring for a wellness suite that comes equipped with Mirror workouts to add some exercise “play” to your workday.

['Lexi Zeeman'],2020-05-02  ,L.A. Affairs: That moment when I tell my date about my purity ring,"I’ll set the scene for you real quick: It’s 8:17 p.m. on a Sunday. I‘d spent the entire day in my pajamas, only leaving my bed to venture into the bathroom (because obviously) and the kitchen (even more obviously) as I embarked on yet another lazy evening stewing in the blissful awareness of my singleness. In retrospect, it was like training for this self-quarantine.

Like many girls are all too familiar with, I’m sure, this led to the inevitable creation of an online dating profile. The second guy I allotted a right swipe to was Anthony. Mind you, I was being relatively picky because I had zero intention of doing anything.

The swiping right was fine, but then I had to go overboard with the whole “Hey there :)” situation.

Advertisement

We exchanged numbers and not .25 seconds later my phone lit up. I answered. Like a moth to a flame.

We found ourselves having those rare conversations that occur between strangers. The ones that flow without rationale and are devoid of analysis or much thought at all.

He made me laugh and feel beautiful without being anything close to objectified, which is really saying something in this Tinder world. We talked for two hours. Two. Hours. With a complete stranger.

Advertisement

His voice was deep in that way in which you can hear him say anything — “Hello,” even — and an involuntary lip-bite occurs. It just occurred again as I typed that out and started reliving it. So yes, it started with a sexy as hell “Hello” and then just spiraled from there.

We made plans for Friday night.

He’d said, “I’ll pick you up in 20 in my lime-green Camaro. It’s an acquired taste, so you’ve been warned.” I slipped on my lucky maroon pants and white tank top. Waiting in my driveway in Westwood was that outrageous car he warned me about, but also a handsome gent sitting inside.

Advertisement

We drove down Sunset Boulevard and, because I often feel like I’m watching my life instead of living it, it all felt like some Hollywood movie moment. Surrounded by the city lights on either side of us, I had to alternate from gazing at his handsome face and taking in the views of the city. He pulled up to Pink Taco and valet-parked. He wrapped a muscled arm around me as he guided me inside. There we talked about our past relationships, religion, politics — all the forbidden topics.

Before I could order my second margarita he pointed to that gold ring on my left hand and asked, “Is that some type of promise ring?”

I was so surprised that he even noticed.

Advertisement

Turned out that this boy not only saw my tiny ring on the half-phone-screen-sized picture from Bumble, but then still swiped right, texted me, called me and even asked me on a date.

I found myself back in that familiar moment — the one where I explain the tricky truth behind that golden band given to me by my mom a decade earlier, when I was 12.

This wasn’t just a piece of jewelry meant to keep the “bad boys” away. It was a promise. A promise to God and to myself that I would keep as many pieces of my heart (and body) for the one who would cherish me for longer than a night. I had no doubt God had something so beautiful in store. I just needed to be patient — and find someone whose patience mirrored my own.

As I sat there, I waited for Anthony to gracefully bow out of the race.

Advertisement

Spoiler alert: That’s not what he did. When I finished explaining he didn’t try to challenge why I was doing it. He didn’t ask if it was hard. He didn’t ask if I thought I would change my mind. He didn’t ask what the limits were, or even if I’d ever broken them before with someone else.

He smiled at me and said, “Honestly, I think that is the coolest thing ever ... I respect you so much for sticking to it. Don’t ever change your mind about it.”

I know it would be so much more romantic to say that his answer and our chemistry were parallel in perfection, and that we are still together, heading toward a wedding day.

The reason time hasn’t erased this evening isn’t because I fell in love.

Advertisement

His reaction to my purity ring stands as my measuring stick for the boys who have followed.

It all looked perfect and in the moment; on paper, there wasn’t a single thing wrong with Anthony. But we didn’t have sparks. Sparks are not to be confused with butterflies, two very different things. Sparks are passion. Sparks are fearless. They are the click or connection that makes the difference between a friendship and a romance. They are something that you don’t really find often. To me, sparks are necessary for a forever love.

After we said our goodbyes that night, I never accepted another invitation to meet up again.

For the first time in my dating history, though, the lack of a second date had nothing to do with its inevitable lack of sex.

Advertisement

That night, though, proved something to me — something city life and L.A. players made me question more each day.

I hold this story close because Anthony stands as the boy who reminded me what I was worth, at the moment I desperately needed to hear it.

Ladies, they exist.

The ones we are looking for, they really do.

Advertisement

The boundaries I chose for myself are valid. The standards you’ve set, well, they might be different than mine but there’s a reason you’ve chosen them. And they matter.

Anthony was my stepping stone. He reminded me to be hopeful. Choosing to have sex to fill someone else’s needs wasn’t going to bring me the love I so desired. In the chaos of Los Angeles, maybe you need that reminder too.

['Shan Boodram'],2020-05-01  ,‘I’m watching a ton of porn. Is that OK?’ An expert answers coronavirus sex questions,"Shan Boodram is an Los Angeles-based certified sex educator with 598,000 subscribers on YouTube, and a new daily show on Quibi, “Sexology With Shan.” Here, she shares answers to some of our most intimate questions:

This pandemic — and sheltering in place — is killing my sex drive. Is that normal?

It is 100% natural for too much proximity to kill sex drive. And not even just too much proximity but a lot of proximity amidst a very stressful time with constant negative news. That is not a natural aphrosdisiac. The result? You don’t feel like having sex.

Fire needs air to breathe. And passion, similarly, needs air to breathe. And when you are on top of each other all the time and you’re not giving the brain any kind of new or novel experience or anything new to stem off of, to spitball into sexual tension, then it’s very difficult to get your libido going. So it’s normal.

It doesn’t have to be normal. The fun thing about the word “normal” is that you get to decide what that means. And so if this is something that you’re accepting because this quarantine time is not forever, that’s all right. But if you’re not OK with that, you can adjust this normal by reducing the stressful content you allow into your home and coming up with coping strategies together that put both of you in a refreshed mind space.

And finally, look for ways to create dopamine-inducing exciting experiences in the home, whether that be time apart, whether that be utilizing porn, utilizing different environments, or driving somewhere and maybe having sex where it’s out there in the world. I’m not really quite sure what would feel fresh for you, but you have to search for that fresh experience to reignite that passion. Again, normal is subjective. But is it OK? Absolutely. It’s OK right now if you’re not in the mood and your partner’s not either.

I’m single and I live alone. So quarantining is so hard when I have almost no human contact. I miss sex, dating and meeting new people.

That is OK. And not only is it OK, it is extremely healthy. We are mammals that are born to bond. We are born to be with other people. We crave romantic connections. We crave intimacy. We crave human touch, and if you are missing those that just means that you’re human. Now, does this mean that you should act out on it? Absolutely not. Nothing is more important than your health and the health of those around you, but there are unique ways that people can still engage with others. There are the obvious dating apps — OKCupid said there were more messages sent in March as a result of the quarantine. So people are looking to connect if you are. There are also a ton of opportunities for cybersex, a ton of opportunities for utilizing social media platforms. Of course, nothing can replace the real thing. But there are ways to ensure that you still do have sexual connection to others without compromising your health.

I’m watching a ton of porn lately — it somehow feels wrong.

No, you should definitely check out some of the stats from PornHub and other sites about porn consumption these days. They’re also finding spikes in porn watching really, really late in the night. So people are staying up later because they’re not going to work and that leads to more porn consumption. That is normal.

I think it’s actually quite beautiful because it’s people trying to create a normal during these very abnormal times, and preserving sex and making sex still be a thing. That’s OK in a time where we can’t touch or be within six feet of people — it can be actually very soothing, it can be a coping mechanism for some people.

It’s only weird if you feel like it’s preventing you from focusing on other areas that could be helping you in this time of quarantine. So, for example, if you feel so overly consumed with porn to the extent that you’re not connecting with family and friends, you’re not connecting with others, the porn consumption is making you feel worse, not better — that’s when it’s cause for pause. But if it’s actually helping you and making you feel better and helping you to adjust to this time, then I say that you’re not alone. You’re not wrong.

With all of our new free time in quarantine, my partner wants to have sex more than ever. How can we find a sexual balance that works for both of us?

I think the balance comes in looking at coping strategies versus sexual libido. Your coping strategies might massively impact why you want to have sex more, or why you’re not interested in sex at all. There are going to be so many babies at the end of this year as a result of this quarantine, but a lot of people have no interest in having sex at all. Stress is not a natural sexual pick-me-up. On the flip side, though, there’s something known as arousal confusion. That’s what happens when your body misinterprets signals like adrenaline spikes and elevated heart rate that are due to fear or stress and that your body can perceive as physiological arousal. So stress can actually make somebody get hornier or heighten feelings that can make someone get horny. It’s kind of similar to why some people get really horny during an argument. So that might be happening to your partner. You might be having the adverse reaction. And the way to meet in the middle is to focus more on how are we handling this uniquely stressful time. What are our tools and strategies to bring us both to a space where we feel good and we’re making the healthiest decision for ourselves? And more important, how can you empathize with your partner during a time when, more than anything, they just need to be supported?

I have found myself masturbating a lot more than usual. Is this normal? Any other suggestions for dealing with sexual tension?

Advertisement

I don’t think that anyone gets to say what’s normal during an unprecedented, historically unique time. Don’t be so hard on yourself. That’s my advice for everybody: Make yourself feel OK. And that may look different for each person. Don’t worry so much about what everybody else is doing. Really focus on what’s enriching you and what’s allowing you to have the best shot of coming out of this as healthy and as happy as possible. If masturbation is a part of that formula for you, I’d say absolutely continue.

Any other suggestions for dealing with sexual tension?

Yes, you can engage with other people by digisexuality, which is engaging with sex using technology as a liaison. On my new show on Quibi, we have an entire episode on digisexuality during the COVID-19 outbreak and how to utilize technology to enhance your sex life. A famous sex expert said that the safest sexual partner during this time is yourself, but cybersexuality or digisexuality challenges that and allows you to experience pleasure alongside others or even at the hand of others without actually physically being touched — that’s through the use of some toys that allow for remote control.

My partner and I are staying with his parents during the quarantine and it’s really hard to have sex with these thin walls.

How to keep things hot in a situation like this! This sounds like the Christmas dilemma, except now we’re in spring. So it’s slightly warmer. I think that hot sex might still be an option if you guys do have a car and make sure you wipe everything down and wash your hands before and after. Maybe that’s your only chance of a getaway and also in a space that you can control who’s been there and who’s been within six feet of it. Other things you can do: Maybe it’s timing walks. If you guys are all doing daily walks or exercise, maybe you have some alone time when your parents go out for their walks. That might even be a conversation for you to have with them: “We need a bit of alone time. Would you mind just giving us a text when you’re on your way back from your walk?” I don’t know what your relationship is like with your parents, but it sounds like you’re staying with them so they must acknowledge you do have a sex life. Also, there’s quiet sex.

Finding creative ways to overcome this together can actually help to heighten sex drive and to bring a bit of danger to the situation that might increase your libido. So lean into that. Be creative with your partner. Be novel in your approach to solving this and be thankful that you’re in a home with parents who are probably cooking all your favorite meals right now, because that’s definitely where I wish I was right now.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-05-01/sex-expert-shan-boodram-answers-your-coronavirus-sex-questions
"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",2020-05-05  ,Stocks post gains even after late-day stumble,"Stocks on Wall Street closed broadly higher Tuesday as more countries relaxed restrictions on businesses, raising hopes for a recovery from the historic plunge that is sweeping the global economy.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index closed up 0.9%, although it lost about half of its early gains in a late-in-the-session burst of selling. Technology and healthcare stocks accounted for much of the gains, which followed a strong showing in overseas markets.

Investors are cautiously optimistic that the gradual reopening of some businesses will begin to turn around the economy.

In California, some retail businesses could begin serving customers again as early as Friday, under some restrictions. Many European countries have also begun relaxing strict orders meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, while waiting to see if it leads to a resurgence in infections. In Asia, the first pitches of the South Korean baseball season thwacked into catchers’ mitts, albeit in stadiums with no fans in attendance.

Expectations for stronger demand for oil as more businesses get the green light to open helped drive the price of oil sharply higher, extending its mini-rally after it fell to record lows last month.

“It’s investors getting a little bit ahead of themselves,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “Maybe it’s a sense of relief that we’ve made it this far and there’s some sort of a path forward, even if it’s not real clear.”

Delwiche noted that questions remain about the pace at which people will venture out of their homes and spend money as businesses reopen.

The S&P 500 index rose 25.70 points to 2,868.44. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 133.33 points, or 0.6%, to 23,883.09. The Nasdaq climbed 98.41 points, or 1.1%, to 8,809.12. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks advanced 9.54 points, or 0.8%, to 1,273.51.

The stock market has been rallying since late March as investors look beyond the devastation that’s ravaging the global economy. They’re focusing instead on the prospects for a resumption of growth later in the year, as well as on the massive support for markets provided by the Federal Reserve. Many analysts are skeptical of the stock market’s rally, saying it’s overdone given all the uncertainty about how long the recession will last, but the S&P 500 has nevertheless more than halved its losses from its sell-off earlier in the year.

A report released Tuesday showed that the U.S. services industry last month shrank for the first time in a decade, but that caused barely a ripple in the stock or bond market. The data weren’t quite as terrible as economists had forecast.

”What we should be watching for is not that things are good; things are not going to be good,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “We should be watching for signs that things are less bad.”

”Just getting people back to work and businesses open again can improve attitudes and confidence,” he said.

Walt Disney Co. fell 3% in extended trading after the company reported a steep drop in quarterly profit as many segments of its media and entertainment offerings ground to a standstill during the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, Disney said costs related to COVID-19 cut its pretax profit by $1.4 billion.

Hopes that the reopening of economies will eventually lead to a pickup in demand have also very recently helped oil prices climb off the floor. U.S. oil to be delivered in June jumped 20.5% to settle at $24.56 a barrel Tuesday, up from a low of $6.50 late last month. That’s still well below the roughly $60 a barrel it cost at the start of the year: The price plunged on worries that the collapse in oil demand would lead to topped-off storage tanks.

Brent crude, the standard for international pricing, rose 13.9% to $30.97 per barrel.

“The feeling on the floor is that energy is in a better spot, and while it’s not brilliant,“ the gulf between oil supplies and demand “is starting to shift in a more positive direction,” Chris Weston of Pepperstone said in a report.

Technology stocks continued their strong run. Apple rose 1.5%. Microsoft gained 1.1%. The two companies alone account for 11% of the S&P 500’s entire market value. Tech stocks in the S&P 500 have nearly erased all their losses for 2020, after earlier being down as much as 23%. The sector is now down 0.3%.

In Europe, Germany’s DAX rose 2.5%, the CAC 40 in Paris gained 2.4% and the FTSE 100 in London rose 1.7%.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 1.1% as the government said it would relax some social distancing measures, allowing certain businesses such as gyms, cinemas and beauty salons to reopen and doubling the number of individuals allowed at public gatherings to a maximum of eight. Markets in Tokyo, Shanghai and Seoul were closed for holidays.

['Lisa Lee'],2020-05-05  ,The Fed once warned about fuzzy accounting. Now it’s propping up firms that use it,"For years, the Federal Reserve warned that too many companies were engaging in fuzzy accounting that bumped up their earnings — making it easier for them to obtain loans. The practice — known as adjusted Ebitda — was driving up corporate debt to excessive and worrisome levels, regulators chastised.

But now, in its latest effort to keep credit flowing, the Fed has done a remarkable about-face. It essentially endorsed the dubious practice with a program that may serve to bail out some of the nation’s most leveraged companies.

The Fed move “rewards the worst abusers,” said Mark Carey, a former Fed official and co-president of GARP Risk Institute, the research arm of an association of risk managers. “People will see this as a backstop and in the future they will be encouraged to take on really high leverage.”

The reversal came in the Fed’s announcement last week to expand its Main Street Lending Program to allow more small and medium-sized businesses to qualify for as much as $600 billion in loans. That was widely applauded. But less noticed was a provision that allows companies that had used the widely abused accounting techniques in the past to seek the loans.

At issue is the trend among many leveraged companies to “adjust” a key measure of their results — known as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda — to make themselves appear more creditworthy. After intense lobbying by business groups, the Fed has now said those adjusted earnings can be used for the Main Street lending program, rather than the earnings figured using generally accepted accounting standards.

The ability of companies to inflate projections, by for example counting expected savings from a cost-cutting program, is generally legal and an accepted practice. But it can distort the lending process and raises questions about the company’s ability to repay loans. That’s especially crucial now. Unlike the government’s Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, the Main Street loans are required to be paid back.

The Fed included some guardrails in the program to limit losses. The banks that originate the loans are to have skin in the game by holding between 5% to 15% of the loan amount. And loans for part of the facility must have ratings that could exclude the most aggressive debt.

Carey and others also note that the Fed’s motivation — to lend support to even more businesses and to prevent widespread waves of bankruptcy from further hobbling the economy — is understandable. But they also worry about the message it’s sending to companies and lenders, that the central bank will bail them out regardless of how egregious their actions, a concept known as moral hazard.

“As the Fed issues alarms about certain assets going forward, it raises the question whether private sector participants will listen to it,” said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income.

The Fed’s historic action, lending directly for the first time since Word War II, came after Congress set aside capital to to support lending to smaller businesses. The first announcement, on March 23, allowed companies with high-yield bonds or leveraged loans to participate as well. In weighing their credit strength, the Fed said that it would consider their Ebitda. But the market was left confused by whether that meant adjusted Ebitda or standard Ebitda.

The latest statement on April 30 clarified what the Fed meant: Adjusted would be accepted.

Advertisement

That marks a stark contrast with a series of Fed warnings going back to 2013 aimed at reining in risky lending practices. A Fed official in 2018 noted “material loosening of terms and weaknesses in risk management,” particularly in adjustments to Ebitda.

“The presence of these practices, especially without the appropriate controls, may lead to safety and soundness concerns,” Todd Vermilyea, a senior Fed official, said in a speech.

And two years before that, Fed bank supervisors cautioned Goldman Sachs Group Inc. over risk to a debt deal it arranged to fund a $4-billion buyout of Ultimate Fighting Championship, according to people familiar with the matter at the time. Regulators were concerned about UFC’s use of accounting adjustments that more than doubled its Ebitda projections.

That was just one of many changes to Ebitda that have flared into a serious and pervasive problem in recent years, regulators and market players have said. These adjustments, known as add-backs in accounting lingo, increased from an average 9% at the start of 2015 to well north of 20% in 2019 for merger-related leveraged loan issuance, according to research firm Covenant Review.

Inflating Ebitda can help an indebted company borrow more, and in the process distort the loan-to-value ratio that guides the $2.9-trillion market for junk bonds and loans in the U.S. and Europe.

To see how adjustments affect creditworthiness, loans involved with mergers and acquisition last year had debt loads that were 5.5 times its Ebitda. But take out the adjustments and that ratio jumps to an extremely high 7.5 times, according to Covenant Review.

The new Fed lending facility limits debt to no more than six times earnings for a company to be eligible for two of the programs.

But for companies that have played the adjustment game, that leverage cap becomes less relevant, said Scott Macklin, director of leveraged loan strategies at asset manager AllianceBernstein.

“We foresee the ability for companies which are far more levered than six times to take advantage of the program given the creative adjustments to Ebitda often marketed,” he said.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-05-05/fed-fuzzy-accounting

Despite clear evidence that the idea makes no sense whatsoever in the context of the current economic crisis — and would be dead on arrival in the Democratic congressional caucus anyway — Trump keeps returning to it. Most recently, he brought it up Sunday during his appearance on Fox News.

Referring to plans for another stimulus bill, Trump said: “As I told Steve [Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary] just today, we’re not doing anything unless we get a payroll tax cut.”

By pushing to cut off the program’s funding stream, President Trump is taking the first step toward dismantling Social Security. Max Richtman, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare

In all his references to the payroll tax cut over the last few weeks, Trump hasn’t offered any indication that he understands the payroll tax, knows what it’s used for, or why as a tool to get cash into the hands of Americans it would be better than any other option.

It’s possible that whoever has been putting the idea in his head understands that it would threaten the stability of Social Security, which receives most of the tax, but that’s hardly a comforting thought.

“By pushing to cut off the program’s funding stream, President Trump is taking the first step toward dismantling Social Security,” says Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.

Is this even a genuine idea in Trump’s mind?

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) had a properly skeptical reaction Monday when she was asked about it during an interview with CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer. “I can’t spend a whole lot of time on the quote of the day from the president of the United States,” she said dismissively.

No kudos for Blitzer, however, who kept nattering on about Trump’s comment as though it were (a) serious and (b) intelligent.

“Why is a payroll tax cut a nonstarter?” he asked Pelosi. Moments later, after Pelosi commented that in negotiations for the next stimulus bill, “we’re talking about life and death, we’re talking about people dying, we’re talking about people risking their lives to save people’s lives,” Blitzer came back with, “But what’s wrong with a payroll tax cut?”

Advertisement

He returned robotically to this theme three more times during his 5 1/2-minute encounter with the speaker.

This is how CNN displays its irrelevancy in the debate over the nation’s coronavirus response. Blitzer’s staff, one can safely wager, is capable of independently appraising the wisdom or stupidity of a payroll tax cut and providing its findings to CNN’s audience.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump’s demand for a payroll tax cut is a non-starter for the new coronavirus stimulus bill. “Nobody’s putting anything on the table and saying, ‘unless we have this, we’re not doing that.’ He shouldn’t either.” https://t.co/LDAxWW64S8 pic.twitter.com/cnFYcQTMkp — The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) May 4, 2020

Instead, Blitzer spent more than five minutes trying to back Pelosi into a negotiating position — which if he knows Pelosi at all, he must know was never going to happen. Or perhaps he was trying to take charge of the negotiations himself.

Advertisement

So Blitzer wasted five minutes of his time, Pelosi’s time, and your and my time in this bootless exercise, as though the only thing at stake is whether Pelosi or Trump emerges from the legislative process with bragging rights.

Since CNN appears to be incapable of doing its homework on the payroll tax or thinking for itself, it falls to us to do it for them.

So here, once again, is all that’s wrong with a payroll tax cut.

To begin with, it would do nothing to help Americans who need the most help. To benefit from a payroll tax cut, a worker must be paying the payroll tax. That’s not happening for the 30 million Americans who have filed for unemployment benefits in the last few weeks, because by definition they’re no longer on a payroll.

The payroll tax cut would have zero benefit for millions of Americans who don’t pay into Social Security, including many state and local workers who aren’t covered by the system, and seniors already receiving Social Security benefits, who are no longer paying the tax.

Moreover, even for many workers still receiving paychecks, the tax cut would be trivial to the point of being nugatory. If the payroll tax of 6.2% were to be cut in half, that would give a household collecting $50,000 a year in wages a benefit this year of $1,550, or about $30 a week.

The tax cut would be poorly targeted. It would go to every wage earner, no matter how affluent. The benefit of the 50% cut would come to $4,269, or $82 a week, for those earning the maximum wage covered by the payroll tax ($137,700 this year).

As I reported when Trump first tried to draw a line in the sand in favor of a payroll tax cut, roughly two-thirds of it would go to the rich.

Specifically, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit think tank that tracks how taxes and tax breaks are distributed along the income spectrum, 65% of the benefit would go to the top 20% of earners — those making $118,700 or more a year. Fully 25% of the benefit would go to the top 1%. That group collects income of $643,700 or more, with an average income of $2 million.

The poorest 20%, with income below $24,200, would receive only 2% of the benefit. The next poorest 20% would receive 6% of the benefit.

An effective stimulus requires a benefit that is immediate and noticeable. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, for instance, provided one-time government checks of up to $1,200 for married couples, including $300 per child.

The payments were phased out starting with household income of $150,000 (for couples), but even low-income households that owed no federal tax were eligible for at least $300, provided they earned at least $3,000 during the year.

Studies later found that recipients pumped as much as 90% of the payments into the economy within three months. As former Federal Reserve Governor Claudia Sahm reported , “Stimulus that is not seen or recognized by individuals is unlikely to affect their sentiment.”

Some supporters of a payroll tax cut point to the cut enacted as a stimulus measure in 2011, during the Obama administration. But that was enacted because Republicans made clear President Obama would have no choice — they flatly rejected every other option. And since they controlled Congress, they got their way.

Advertisement

Obama saw the cut as an unpalatable choice, but it was “the best we could do at the time given the political constraints,” his former economic advisor Jason Furman noted in March, when Trump first started talking about the cut as a coronavirus stimulus option. “But it was far from optimal then and would be even further from optimal now.”

Given its obvious shortcomings as an economic tool, it’s hard not to focus on the subtext of the GOP love for a payroll tax cut. It’s an attack on Social Security, a program Republicans have tried to undermine for all its 85 years.

“Social Security is an earned benefit fully funded by the contributions of workers throughout their working lives,” Richtman informed Trump in an April 24 letter.

“A payroll tax cut or deferral chips away at that fundamental idea, making it easier each time it is enacted to turn to it again to meet some future crisis, until the payroll tax is not just cut or deferred but is eliminated. Undermining the program in this manner would help achieve the goals of opponents of Social Security including those who would privatize the program.”

That’s what this is all about, even if Trump doesn’t know it. Trump whisperers know he has room for no more than one idea in his head on any topic, and once he’s grasped onto it, it’s hard to dislodge. Here are the ideas that need to supplant it: A payroll tax cut won’t help most Americans, it will go mostly to the rich, and it will harm a program that many Trump voters hold dear.

The property spans a third of an acre on a flat corner lot in the Summit enclave, a gated community where pop star Britney Spears and actress Melody Thomas Scott have also owned homes.

This one fits six bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms into just over 7,000 square feet. That’s a bit smaller than McMahon’s other former home, a three-story Tudor in Bel-Air that covers about 7,600 square feet. That one hit the market for $12.5 million in 2018, The Times previously reported.

['Justin Bachman'],2020-05-05  ,"For $39 extra, Frontier Airlines will let passengers keep their distance","Frontier Airlines said it’s going to charge extra for passengers who want to guarantee a spot next to an unoccupied middle seat in the age of social distancing.

The carrier aims to generate revenue on the empty seats, charging from $39 to $89 depending on the route. It will have 18 “More Room” assignments available on each flight from Friday through Aug. 31, spokeswoman Jennifer De La Cruz said Monday.

The new product complements a face-covering mandate Frontier is imposing for passengers starting Friday to help guard against the spread of the new coronavirus, along with a “health requirement” customers must accept before they can check in for a flight.

As part of that new system, Frontier travelers must check their temperature, attest that neither they nor anyone in their household has exhibited COVID-19 related symptoms for 14 days and wash their hands or use sanitizer before boarding a flight on Denver-based Frontier, which is owned by private equity firm Indigo Partners LLC.

Large carriers such as American Airlines and Delta Air Lines say they’ve begun blocking many middle seats to promote greater distance among passengers. The airlines don’t guarantee a middle seat will be unoccupied and they generally may assign them as needed.

Last week, American said it would sell only half the middle seats available in its economy cabin, though it will assign those seats when necessary. Southwest Airlines Co. is also limiting its seat sales to promote greater spacing but did not specify by how much.

“We are well aware that all airlines, Frontier included, are making efforts to allow people to spread out,” De La Cruz said in an email. “But the opportunity for those measures will taper off as more people start flying.”

Ultra low-cost airlines such as Frontier, Spirit Airlines and Ryanair generally need to sell more of their seats to break even than do larger airlines that have more frills that generate revenue and generally higher fares.

Last month, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said his airline, which has suspended most of its flights, would not resume operating if government regulators require empty middle seats that can’t be sold.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/travel/story/2020-05-05/frontier-airlines-to-charge-passengers-to-social-distance-on-flights

All other sailings in North America will be suspended through Aug. 31.

The company said it was taking a “measured approach” to resume sailing by starting with ports where most passengers arrive by car rather than by air. The cruise line also promised new health safety protocols to avoid the spread of the coronavirus.

Eight of Carnival’s ships plan to return to the sea in August: Dream, Freedom, Vista, Horizon, Magic, Sensation, Breeze and Elation. The first sailings will visit the eastern and western Caribbean as well as the Bahamas. Four-day cruises from Miami to Key West, Fla., and Cozumel, Mexico, start at $139 per person on Aug. 6 and 20. Four-day cruises from Port Canaveral to the Bahamas and Princess Cays starts at $149 per person on Aug. 13 and 27.

It’s a first planned step for cruises that have been suspended since mid-March. Cruise ships are under orders from the CDC not to sail to or from U.S. ports after several cruise ships reported outbreaks of the disease on board.

Carnival originally canceled cruises through June 30. Now the company canceled all other North American and Australia cruises through Aug. 31. In addition, cruises to Alaska are dropped as well as two longer itineraries: Vancouver to Honolulu that was set to sail Sept. 25, and Honolulu to Brisbane, Australia, which was supposed to depart Oct. 6.

Some parks never officially closed (like Channel Islands). Some, like Yosemite, are such magnets for visitors that superintendents felt obliged to close them relatively early. Still others, like the Grand Canyon, closed later despite heavy visitor traffic.

At other parks, it’s harder to be sure what’s happening when.

But the lodge’s general store and gift shop are to open for roughly the same dates, with restaurants reduced to a grab-and-go menu. The lodge website says campground operations are expected to proceed as usual.

Meanwhile in the offices of Grand Teton National Park, spokeswoman Denise Germann cautions visitors not to jump to conclusions about the park reopening.

Los Angeles city parks, beaches and markets

City Recreation and Parks officials say most most park areas “remain open for walking and running.” But they are enforcing a range of restrictions. Among them: All public hiking trails and trailheads in the city of Los Angeles have been closed since March 27.

Also closed are all public beaches, public beach parking lots, beach bathrooms, piers, beach access points and the Venice Boardwalk and Ocean Front Walk (with limited access to essential businesses).

All recreation centers, aquatic facilities, golf courses, skate parks, tennis courts, playgrounds, baseball fields, soccer fields and basketball courts are also closed, as are other “indoor and outdoor sport amenities.”

In Griffith Park, authorities have closed all facilities and trails, including the Observatory, Travel Town, train rides, the pony rides, the merry-go-round and some roads. But the bicycle rental operation has been open.

Los Angeles County’s beaches, piers, beach bike paths, beach access points, public trails, trailheads and tennis courts are also closed, under an order that covers beaches in every coastal city and unincorporated area of the county.

Parks officials noted on their website that “you can still enjoy time outdoors at your local park for passive use, such as walking, jogging, or leisure time outdoors for individuals or families. Social distancing is still required, and group gatherings are prohibited by the health order.”

At the Catalina Flyer, which normally offers one departure daily from Newport Beach to Avalon, a phone recording warned that the boat has suspended service until further notice. The Catalina Island Conservancy has closed its visitor facilities, services and trails.



State parks in Southern California

On March 18, state parks officials closed all state campgrounds. On March 29, they tightened restrictions further, closing vehicle access to the entire state park system — 280 parks, including off-road vehicle areas.

Since then, the state has fully closed dozens of parks, banning pedestrians as well as vehicles. Among them: The Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve; more than a dozen state parks and beaches in L.A. County; San Clemente State Beach in Orange County; seven state beaches in San Diego County; and four state beaches and parks in Ventura County.

But more recently, some parks have quietly reopened, while still keeping their roadways and parking lots closed to discourage visitors from outside the immediate area. On Monday morning, Carlsbad, South Carlsbad and Torrey Pines state beaches reopened that way, with visitors limited to active recreation and no group gatherings.

Its pier, restrooms, playground and street parking remain closed.



Orange County

On Saturday and Sunday, April 25 and 26, many of the county’s shores, especially Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, were so crowded that photographs alarmed many people, including the governor.

With his action Thursday, Newsom set in motion the “hard close” of Orange County’s local and state beaches.

Parking lots at all county beaches, regional and wilderness parks remain closed as well. So are parking spaces at all trailheads; parking lots at Irvine Lake; parking along Black Star Canyon Road; pedestrian access points at Thousand Steps, Table Rock, West, Camel Point and Treasure Island beaches; restrooms; playgrounds; exercise equipment; shelters and trailheads. Pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians were permitted.

Orange County also banned vehicular traffic to Carbon Canyon, Clark, Craig, Irvine, Laguna Niguel, Mason, Mile Square, Tri-City and Yorba regional parks. Pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians were permitted.

Orange County’s Supervisors have cleared the way for public and private golf courses to open.

Among individual Orange County coastal cities, north to south:

• Seal Beach had already closed its beach, pier and many park amenities. But green space within its parks remains accessible; social distancing is required.

• Huntington Beach’s pier and beach parking lots have been closed since late March, followed by closure of street parking along Pacific Coast Highway April 16 and closure of Huntington Harbor beaches on April 17. But some golf courses have reopened in recent days.

• Newport Beach, which had kept beaches open until Thursday, on March 25 closed its beachfront parking lots and piers, and later added its Oceanfront Boardwalk on the Balboa Peninsula and the Balboa Island Bayfront Walkway to the forbidden list.

• In Laguna Beach, closures cover all basketball, volleyball and tennis courts; all playgrounds; its community pool; parking lots at Aliso Beach; and three beach-adjacent city parks: Main Beach city park, Heisler city park and Treasure Island city park.

• In Dana Point, city, county and state beach and harbor public parking lots are closed, as is Dana Cove Beach and many coast-adjacent streets.

• San Clemente, which had reopened beaches on April 25, now must close them again. On April 1 it closed tennis courts, ball fields and picnic areas as well, but the city’s trails remained open.



Throughout Los Angeles County

The Safer at Home order from Los Angeles County Public Health officials, issued March 21 and updated April 10, prohibits all public and private group events and gatherings through May 15. It also says that individuals and families are not prohibited from “hiking, walking, biking or shopping at [e]ssential [b]usinesses,” as long as they keep their distance from others.

The order also notes that if local entities (such as municipal governments) choose to impose stricter limits, the county order does not supersede them.

Los Angeles County has closed all indoor and outdoor playgrounds, along with indoor shopping centers and all swap meets and flea markets.

• In San Bernardino County, the Mt. Baldy Resort reopened for skiers on Wednesday, saying its new limits would allow for proper social distancing.

• Also, San Bernardino County on April 25 reopened county parks, lakes, rivers and recreation areas. “Private and city-owned parks, trails, lakes and golf courses also opened on a limited basis,” the L.A. Times Luke Money reports. Big Morongo Canyon Preserve and Mojave River Forks Regional Park are still closed.

• Riverside County leaders on April 20 allowed golf courses to reopen, with restrictions. Hiking, bikes and horseback-riding on trails and in parks are also permitted under the county’s health order.



San Diego County parks and beaches

San Diego County Board of Supervisors reopened county-run beaches there April 27 to swimming, surfing, kayaking and paddle-boarding but not group activities, sunbathing or boating.

The cities of San Diego, Coronado and Oceanside have taken similar actions, as has the Port of San Diego, which controls 34 miles of the county’s waterfront. Most beach parking lots and boardwalks remain closed, as do state beaches.

In Carlsbad, Del Mar and Solana Beach, beaches remain closed until further notice. Del Mar’s City Council scheduled a meeting Friday afternoon to discuss the beaches.

Most of San Diego County’s parks and preserves have remained open for pedestrians, cyclists and equestrians, but their parking lots and many facilities and amenities are closed.



National forests in Southern California

The U.S. Forest Service has closed campgrounds, picnic areas, bathrooms and other developed recreation sites in its California forests through May 15, leaving Southern California’s four forests — Angeles, Cleveland, Los Padres and San Bernardino — to make their own decisions on trail access and parking.

• In the Angeles National Forest, authorities on April 3 closed 23 well-used San Gabriel mountain trails, four popular trailheads and 19 roads.

This map shows the affected areas. The closures include the Millard Canyon above Altadena, San Antonio Falls, Icehouse Canyon and North Devil’s Backbone trailheads.

The forest order shuts routes to Echo Mountain and Mt. Lowe, such as the Sam Merrill Trail, above Altadena, as well as others leading to Mt. Wilson, San Gabriel Peak, the Rim Trail and other routes in the San Gabriel Mountains.

• In the San Bernardino National Forest, whose 680,000 acres include four mountain ranges in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, a spokesman said trails, trailheads, staging areas that function as trailheads and parking areas at trailheads remain open. Hikers should practice social distancing, sticking to wide fire roads instead of single-track trails that are too narrow, the spokesman said.

• In Los Padres National Forest, which includes about 1.95 million acres reaching north from Ventura County into Central California, spokesman Andrew Madsen said trailhead parking and trails remain open, as do dispersed camp sites in the backcountry.

• In Cleveland National Forest, which reaches into San Diego, Riverside and Orange counties, the list of sites closed includes all trails and picnic areas where an Adventure Pass is usually required.

In the forest’s Trabuco ranger district, closures include: El Cariso north/south picnic area; Hot Springs trailhead; San Juan loop trailhead; Tenaja trailhead; Trabuco creek picnic area; Wildomar staging area; Maple Springs day-use area.

In the forest’s Descanso Ranger District, closures include Agua Dulce; Bear Valley OHV (off-highway vehicle) area; and Corral Canyon.

In the forest’s Palomar Ranger District, closures include Crestline; Henshaw scenic vista; Inaja Memorial; Kica Mik Overlook; Palomar Mountain Interpretive Station; San Luis Rey Picnic Area; Fry Creek Trailhead; Observatory Trailhead; and Barker Valley Trailhead. The popular Cedar Creek Falls and Three Sisters Falls trails have been closed since March 21.



National parks in California

The National Park Service closed Yosemite National Park on March 20; Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks on March 25; Joshua Tree National Park on March 31; and Death Valley National Park (except for California 190 and Daylight Pass) on April 4.

['Emily Zemler'],2020-05-05  ,Rapman’s ‘Blue Story’ battles #BAFTAsoWhite and coronavirus on the way to the screen,"Rapman’s feature debut, “Blue Story,” met its share of hurdles on the way to the screen. The film, adapted from the writer-director’s three-part 2014 YouTube series of the same name, nearly lost its star weeks before production, was pulled from theaters in the U.K. last fall following a lobby brawl, got overlooked at the BAFTAs and lost its shot at a U.S. theatrical premiere due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But for Rapman, née Andrew Onwubolu, these challenges have only made the film’s success all that sweeter.

“I actually believe going forward people will start their own drama to get onto the news,” the London-based director reflects on the film’s controversial opening, speaking via Zoom alongside star Micheal Ward after the U.K. lockdown was put in place. “We were on the news every day for a week. ‘Blue Story’ was everywhere. It was the talk of the city. You couldn’t buy that type of press. It will go down in history. It was a blessing in disguise.”

For Rapman, who based the story of two best friends living in rival gang territories in South-East London on his own upbringing in Deptford and Peckham, “Blue Story” is ultimately about finding the light on the other side of overwhelming darkness. Looking back now, the director isn’t that concerned that the movie lost 30% of its screens during its first weekend in the U.K. thanks to a mass fight at a theater in Birmingham. The response from Vue and Showcase cinemas was criticized as an aggressive overreaction, with tinges of racism, but “Blue Story” came out the other side with a passionate audience.

“I always wanted to know what our opening weekend would have been,” Rapman notes. “Even though we probably made the numbers up because there was so much hype after that, I want to know, fair play, what would we have done that first weekend?”

Originally, Rapman’s aim was simply to depict the tragic reality of gang life in South London and to showcase how easily teenagers can get sucked into that culture based solely on their home address. His tale of two friends, Timmy and Marco, who are embroiled in rival gangs, reflects on a larger problem but refuses to be didactic. The director has left that lifestyle — and that neighborhood — behind and hopes others can do the same, but he also knows this is everyday life for a lot of young Londoners.

“That was my childhood,” Rapman says with a shrug. “When I was adapting it to the screen I still wasn’t thinking about international. I was thinking, ‘We need to make a real hood movie that is a bit more grounded in our time.’ Nothing’s been modern. [Other movies] don’t even mention Instagram. That’s what was missing to me. I just wanted to give the U.K. something classic. I knew, no matter what, with this film it was my destiny to tell that story.”

The director put up-and-comer Stephen Odubola in the role of Timmy and centered on Ward, who had recently been added to the cast of Netflix’s “Top Boy,” to play Marco. Two weeks before production was set to start, Netflix and the production company behind “Top Boy” refused to let Ward join the cast, fearful that the stories and roles were too similar. To persuade them, Ward wrote an impassioned letter that finally allowed for some flexibility in his contract with Netflix.

“I’m just so happy to be part of both,” the actor says. “I was able to tell real stories rooted in a real place that I’m from and I’m so proud of that. [‘Blue Story’ is] representing something that people know that they didn’t really have a voice for before. No one can really say they’ve seen something like ‘Blue Story.’ This is a lot more raw and — I feel — a lot more real than what’s come before. So the whole time you’re filming you’re thinking, ‘This is bigger than me.’ For me, it wasn’t just my first movie — it was bigger than that.”

The film, shot over 23 days for a modest budget of $1.6 million, substituted North London for South London because the actual boroughs refused to issue filming permits. It was the first feature for all of the main cast members. The budget was bigger than anything Rapman was used to, but it was still restrictive and the production ended up unable to do reshoots. Instead, Rapman edited in actual CCTV footage of gang fights found in the BBC archives, which augments its sense of realism. It’s the kind of movie that rarely comes out of the U.K., a film industry that’s not particularly known for its diversity — especially after January’s whitewashed BAFTA nominations — but already Rapman sees the change that “Blue Story” has brought.

“I’ve already heard about films getting greenlit on the back of the success of ‘Blue Story,’” he says. “I know people who have made a film and the studio said, ‘We’re ready to go ahead now because we’ve seen what “Blue Story” [had] done.’ Before this, they didn’t think these types of film have an audience or make money, but it’s all changed now. I think going forward loads of people are going to get their ‘Blue Story.’”

It’s also shifted things for Ward, who is patiently waiting for the lockdown to end so he can start filming the next season of “Top Boy.” Earlier this year, Ward won the BAFTA Rising Star Award, an accolade that was especially notable due to the lack of diversity in the other BAFTA nominees and films. The British Academy Film Awards failed to nominate “Blue Story” for best British film despite its box office success and strong reviews (and a lot of expectation from the press).

“We don’t have a voice in these rooms so of course we’re going to get shunned,” Ward reflects. “I don’t know who in those rooms could have watched ‘Blue Story’ like that, but regardless if we had more people in that room who were, not even black, just people who were interested in different topics and realizing how powerful other people’s work can be, then it would have been a different story.”

“I was upset by that, but it also didn’t matter,” Rapman says. “It didn’t take away from the success that ‘Blue Story’ has had. Micheal won and that win is connected to ‘Blue Story.’ And ‘Blue Story’ was in the conversation. I don’t live for the awards, but I do feel like it deserved it only because we went through so much. We done the numbers. We made the money. We got good reviews. What else does it have to do to make it? But it can’t take away from what the film achieved and a BAFTA did come out it.”

Now “Blue Story” gets to add to its legacy by traveling to the U.S. as well as Canada — on VOD rather than into theaters as planned. It’s a story that’s inherently specific to London, but its emotions and feelings are universal.

“Americans can look at this now and see a slice of life that they never really witnessed before,” Ward says. “That is a beautiful thing.”

“It’s the same reaction for the movie everywhere,” Rapman adds. “It’s a proud thing to see that our cultures are so close together. We might sound a bit different, we might use different slang, but Crips and Bloods, Ghetto Boys and Peckham — street gangs are street gangs. I think everybody can relate, man.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-05-05/blue-story-rapman-london-gangsters

The CNN anchor stopped by “The Late Show” on Monday night, where host Stephen Colbert thanked him for “giving all of us something joyful to see” during these somber times as the world is still reeling from the coronavirus crisis. Cooper announced the birth of his child, Wyatt Morgan Cooper, last week.

During the interview Cooper shared that he is co-parenting his son with his ex Benjamin Maisani as he reflected on being present for Wyatt’s birth less than a year after being with his mother, fashion entrepreneur Gloria Vanderbilt, as she died.

“My mom died in June, so it hasn’t even been a full year,” said Cooper. “To have experienced the loss of her life and to have been there with her when she breathed her last breath and to witness that and to be holding her at that time, and then to suddenly ... be in a delivery room with this amazing surrogate and her husband and my former partner Benjamin ... and to see a new human being come into existence, which I’d never seen in person before, it was just extraordinary.”

Cooper clarified that although they will be co-parenting, he and Maisani are not back together.

“But he’s my family and I want him to be Wyatt’s family as well,” explained Cooper. News of the couple’s split surfaced in 2018 after they had been together for three years.

Cooper also told Colbert his friend and TV host Andy Cohen has been a big help during this time. Cohen’s son, Benjamin, was born last year.

“He’s actually really helped me because my son is entirely wearing hand-me-downs from Andy Cohen’s son,” said Cooper.

Cooper explained initially he planned on going shopping — something he hates to do — but because of the pandemic was considering looking for baby clothes online. But “it just seemed weird. So, he just gave me all the clothes,” he said.

Hand-me-down baby clothes is not the only thing Wyatt has inherited from his future pal. Cohen explained on his SiriusXM show on Monday that his son’s former nanny is now Wyatt’s nanny.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-05-05/anderson-cooper-baby-wyatt-co-parenting

Andrew Onwubolu) wields words and images the way his young characters use weapons and fists to taunt, cajole, provoke and hurt one another. It’s a Shakespearean rhapsody in indigo where love, friendship, betrayal and revenge swirl and blur with life-changing consequences.

Based on Rapman’s life in South-East London and his 2014 YouTube series, it’s a cautionary tale of two boys — Timmy and Marco — who are fast friends from the first day Timmy’s mom sends him from their home in Deptford to a better school in Peckham. When the boys rocket from age 11 to 15 before the end of the opening credits, we know we are in for a wild ride and a different style of filmmaking.

As Timmy (Stephen Odubola) and Marco (Micheal Ward) navigate typical aspects of high school — homework, girls, hanging out — they are buffeted by larger forces, namely the daily clashes of the Caribbean and African gangs that rule Peckham and nearby Lewisham. The boys’ friendship is further challenged by their close ties to that decades-old conflict through Timmy’s old primary school friend Kiron (who now goes by Killy and is played by Khali Best) and Marco’s brother Switcher (Eric Kofi-Abrefa), both upper echelon gang members on opposite sides.

This is not just an area where black lives matter, they are virtually all that exist, save for the occasional police raid. The rival gangs identify targets based simply on the shade of skin — light vs. dark — and for crossing into the wrong postal code. The violence happens quickly, flash decisions causing repercussions that ripple across families and neighborhoods.

“Blue Story’s” cast, including a standout turn by Karla-Simone Spencer as Timmy’s sweet love interest Leah, brings a fierce, adrenaline-fueled authenticity to their roles. Odubola and Ward are asked to walk a fine line, just as Timmy and Marco do, between innocence and experience. Their downfalls are both credible and heartbreaking.

Though in English, the film is subtitled to convey the heavily accented patois spoken by the characters. It lends a musicality that makes the entire script feel like it’s in verse. Food and culture — both pop and local — are also used to bring the streets alive as a place people actually live … and die.

As the onscreen, rhyme-slinging narrator, Rapman layers tragedy upon tragedy, with the localized authority of a Bruce Springsteen. Where Springsteen injects his songs with a cinematic quality, Rapman does the reverse, using the beats of his music to propel the visuals and storytelling style.

In the end, it’s the underlying inevitability of the violence that feels like the real crime.

The class-action lawsuit, Watson vs. the University of Southern California, alleges that USC is unlawfully refusing to refund all or part of students’ spring 2020 tuition, fees and meal plans, “despite the dramatically lower quality and less valuable education and services now being provided,” according to the complaint, which was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California.

“Essentially, students have paid Defendants for access to buildings they can no longer enter, technology the University is not providing, activities that are not available, and meals that will never be served,” the complaint says. “USC is thus profiting from COVID-19 while further burdening students and their families.”

The lawsuit against USC follows others filed against the University of California and California State University last week alleging that the university systems owe millions of dollars to students who can no longer use health facilities, student centers and other services paid for by fees.

Provost Charles F. Zukoski announced last week that USC would not provide partial tuition refunds for spring or summer sessions. He said the university did provide prorated housing and dining fee refunds to students who vacated university housing.

USC said that it was “disappointed” by the lawsuit but that the university took “extraordinary steps” to maintain the educational experience for students.

“USC pivoted immediately to deliver quality instruction in an online format,” the university said. “Faculty and staff have worked tirelessly to connect with students to ensure that academic work continues on track and that progress toward the completion of a USC degree continues.”

The suit against USC alleges breach of contract and unfair business practices, among other things, on behalf of an estimated 40,000 students who paid tuition and fees for in-person education during the spring 2020 term and did not receive those services or adequate refunds.

The lead plaintiff, Latisha Watson, is a master’s of social work student who lives off campus and doesn’t own a car, according to the complaint. She took out loans to pay $21,886.38 in tuition and fees for the spring semester, including $675 for a meal plan she can no longer use and for which she received no partial refund. The lawsuit seeks, for her and for other members of the class, a refund of the unused portion of meal plan fees and of a percentage of tuition.

“Despite receiving [an] influx of federal funds, Defendants refuse to refund or reimburse Plaintiff and similarly-situated USC students,” the lawsuit says.

USC will receive more than $19 million in federal aid through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. At least half of the funds must be spent directly on emergency aid for students. The other half may be used for institutional costs resulting from disruptions caused by the COVID-`19 pandemic, including reimbursing the university for refunds issued to students for room and board, tuition and other fees, according to guidance from the U.S. Department of Education.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/usc-sued-over-refusal-to-reimburse-tuition-fees

The school’s experimental “Return to Learn” program will begin May 11, when UC San Diego starts giving self-administered tests to 5,000 students who are living in campus housing.

If the program works, campus officials plan to test about 65,000 students, faculty and staff on a monthly basis.

UC San Diego will become the first campus in the University of California system and one of the first in the U.S. to broadly test students for the coronavirus — an undertaking it is well-suited to do. It operates UC San Diego Health, which includes two major hospitals and many clinics, all which are tied to one of the largest medical research programs in the U.S.

“This effort will leverage the ingenuity and expertise of our clinicians, molecular biologists, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians and others to work toward a tailored map of where the virus is, and where it isn’t,” Khosla said in a statement.

“We expect these efforts to help put us in the best possible position to minimize virus outbreaks and implement new interventions as needed, should we resume in-person activities this fall.”

Like other schools, UC San Diego was forced to shift to online classes in March and April as the novel coronavirus spread. The shift has been unpopular with many students, some of whom say that in-person classes offer a much richer learning experience. Students also don’t like paying full tuition for online classes.

The change is causing financial devastation.

Khosla said last week that COVID-19 has cost UC San Diego $150 million so far, and that it is likely to cost an additional $200 million to $300 million by the end of the summer.

Some of the losses stem from the refunds the university had to issue to students who lived in campus housing. At the start of the fall quarter, about 15,000 students lived on campus — a figure that Khosla says could drop below 13,000 this fall due to social distancing rules.

The school — which has been experiencing unprecedented growth for more than a decade — also could lose enrollment due to the public’s fear of the virus. UC San Diego began the fall quarter with nearly 39,000 students, a record.

The Return to Learn program is meant to address that anxiety.

UC San Diego officials said Tuesday that 5,000 undergraduate and graduate residential students will be given nasal swab-based coronavirus tests initially, and that it will check housing wastewater and surface collections for signs of the virus.

Students “will go to one of several designated sites on campus to pick up a clean nasal swab in a specimen collection container,” the university said in a statement. “Using a downloaded barcode-reader app on a smartphone, the participant will scan the unique barcode on the container, linking their cellphone number to the specimen and generating a time stamp.

“The participant will then swab the inside of their own nose, drop the swab in the container and leave it in a collection box to be picked up by program coordinators. The swabs will be tested for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, at the Center for Advanced Laboratory Medicine at UC San Diego Health.”

The university expects to produce test results within roughly 24 hours. Campuswide testing could begin in early September if the program works.

If a person tests positive, the student will be notified and referred to a public health team that will determine whether the participant has been in close contact with other people, UC San Diego said. Any infected students who are shedding the virus will be given dedicated campus housing where they can self-isolate until they’re no longer infectious.

The Bay Area Native Is A Graduate Of Uc Berkeley', 'Started At The Los Angeles Times In']",2020-05-05  ,"Lifting stay-at-home order too soon would cause more deaths, Northern California officials say","Santa Clara County’s executive officer cautioned Tuesday against moving quickly to lift the shelter-in-place order.

The death toll in California is still going up at significant numbers, Dr. Jeffrey Smith told the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors Tuesday. A Times analysis showed that 495 coronavirus deaths were reported statewide in the seven-day period that ended on Sunday. While the weekly death toll represented a 9% decrease compared to the previous week, it also represented nearly one-quarter of the state’s death toll up to that point.

“You can still see that it’s still gone up pretty significantly in recent times,” Smith said. “There’s a lot of talk in California about relaxing shelter-in-place [orders]. I just want to point out that we’re still, in California, going up dramatically. So there’s no clinical evidence that shelter-in-place [orders] should be relaxed at this point.”

Echoing statements by other medical experts, Smith said loosening up the stay-at-home orders will result in more infections and deaths.

With many states now significantly relaxing stay-at-home orders, Smith noted the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is now forecasting a national death toll of more than 134,000 by early August, close to double the current total of 70,000. The institute now forecasts a California death toll of 4,700 by early August, also roughly double of California’s current number of more than 2,300.

Dr. George Rutherford, a UC San Francisco epidemiologist and infectious disease expert, said on KGO-TV that the institute’s estimates so far have been spot-on.

Separately, a private projection by the Trump administration forecasts the daily death toll nationwide to rise to about 3,000 a day on June 1, the New York Times reported. The average daily death toll nationally last week was 1,800 fatalities a day.

Such a daily death toll would be staggering, Rutherford said. “Just remember, 3,000 deaths per day is 90,000 deaths per month. There were 56,000 Americans who died in Vietnam; 44,000 that died in the Korean War, and that was spread out over years,” he said.

“Relaxing shelter-in-place will cause new people to die,” Smith said. “Relaxation that’s more rapid and more widespread will be more risky.”

So far, Santa Clara County has joined five other Bay Area counties in implementing one of the nation’s strictest shelter-in-place orders, and has opted for an extremely slow loosening of the rules. While construction in L.A. County was never ordered halted, the Bay Area had put brakes on most construction, a restriction that was repealed in a new health order on Monday. The Bay Area’s stay-at-home order has been extended to May 31.

Dr. Sara Cody, the Santa Clara County health officer, said the Bay Area’s most populous county is seeing cases and hospitalizations flatten or decrease, and has ample hospital bed capacity. But the county still does not have an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, like masks, gowns and gloves, only one-fifth of the needed testing capacity, and needs to do more to increase the county’s capability to investigate new illnesses.

When asked if the governor’s announcement about the statewide loosening of stay-at-home orders would affect the Bay Area, Cody said health officials were still seeking more specifics from the state as to what’s allowed to be opened.

One elected official, Santa Clara County supervisor Mike Wasserman, expressed concern about the potential duration of the shelter-in-place order and said he hoped all small businesses — from barber shops to jewelry stores — can be allowed to reopen as soon as possible.

“We can’t shelter in place forever,” Wasserman told health officials. “We do know if we don’t let more people go back to work sooner than later, our economy will effectively go on life support.”

County officials asked for more patience, saying increasing testing and disease investigating capabilities are crucial before weakening stay-at-home orders further.

“We’re working really hard because we do know that many, many in our community are suffering from the economy and the social isolation of being at home. So I hear you loud and clear. And I am worried, too,” Cody said.

Smith added that sticking with the shelter-in-place order longer the first time may end up being the better move, not only from a health perspective, but also from an economic one.

During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, while Philadelphia moved too slowly to deal with rising flu outbreaks, St. Louis acted far more quickly, closing many public places swiftly, and, “strangely enough, their economy came back faster than Philadelphia,” Smith said.

A recent study found that cities that moved more aggressively to close down the city as the flu hit experienced a better economic recovery afterward. “It’s never an either-or, it’s always how do you accomplish both good goals. And we’ve got two good goals,” Smith said.

Smith said this pandemic is one of only four worldwide in the past 102 years, and the only one in modern history caused by a coronavirus, a type of virus that until now has been associated with the common cold.

In just a matter of a few months, 256,000 people who have been infected with the coronavirus have died, while the 1957-58 flu pandemic killed 1.1 million people; the 1968 flu pandemic resulted in 1 million deaths and the 1918 pandemic resulted in 50 million dead worldwide.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/lifting-stay-at-home-order-too-soon-would-cause-more-deaths-northern-california-officials-say

The video shows the woman, who was spotted by lifeguards walking her unleashed dog Friday on a beach in Ocean Beach, taken to the ground twice by officers and handcuffed, once on the sand and once on asphalt.



For the record: Because of incorrect information provided by San Diego police, this story originally misstated when dogs are prohibited on San Diego beaches. Dogs can be on beaches until 9 a.m.

The video is more than nine minutes long and ends after the woman is placed into a patrol car. She is wearing a white, one-piece bathing suit and appears to be barefoot.

At one point in the video, an officer can be heard telling a bystander: “Just go away.”

The woman, while being handcuffed for the second time, tells the bystander: “No, don’t go away ... film that.”

Councilwoman Monica Montgomery issued a statement Monday calling for “equity in enforcement” after viewing the video on social media. She asked police leaders and the mayor’s office to look into the matter.

“The footage is particularly concerning and disturbing, as this incident occurred on the heels of protests that clearly violated the public health orders. No arrests were made,” Montgomery, chair of the city’s Committee on Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods, said in a statement. “My office is demanding answers as to why this young woman did not receive equitable enforcement and treatment.”

Montgomery said she did not know the woman or details about the incident but said she thought the way the woman was treated was troubling.

“I have been concerned since my campaign about equitable enforcement in the city of San Diego,” she said.

She said bringing the issue to the “public eye” and discussing it could help improve the situation.

Police officials said the 36-year-old woman was walking in an area where unleashed dogs are prohibited from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. They said the woman refused to talk with lifeguards and police and tried to walk past them.

She was arrested on suspicion of being drunk in public and resisting arrest after she slipped off her handcuffs twice, officials said. She was booked into jail after she was turned away from detox for being uncooperative.

“The San Diego Police Department has a strict non-bias-based policing policy and does not tolerate policing based on factors such as race, gender or national origin,” according to the statement.

Several people who watched the video noted that others who were unmasked and walking dogs in the area were not cited by police, said Francine Maxwell, president of the local NAACP chapter. Maxwell said the “same old problems” remain as residents try to follow health orders requiring facial coverings and keeping six feet apart in public areas.

“Over this past week, the NAACP San Diego branch has become greatly concerned about what appears to be racial discrimination by law enforcement in enforcing the social distancing mandate,” she said in a statement. “In San Diego, we reviewed a video of an African American female aggressively detained by police officers while walking her dog on the beach — while other beachgoers with their dogs were allowed to enjoy their day.”

Last month, Maxwell said she witnessed her own father, who is black and has dementia, being approached by a police van that “jumped the curb” as he was walking alone in a park when parks were closed. Two days later, local protesters, many not wearing masks or following social distancing rules, were allowed to demonstrate in downtown without being cited.

“I am left ... wondering just what it was that made those officers feel that jumping a curb and driving up on a lone pedestrian was a sensible way to enforce a public health measure,” she wrote at the time. “Was their need to enforce their will on a black man really that strong? There was no need to charge their vans into the ‘Freedom Rally’ two days later, so we have to wonder.”

As for Friday’s incident, Maxwell said several people who have seen the video have questioned the “roughness of the arrest” and wondered why a female officer wasn’t called to assist. “Bystanders were offended by the way she was being flipped around,” she added.

Officials said they will review the conduct of officers involved in the arrest to determine if any policies were violated.

Ahn, a Stanford graduate who made an exhilarating run to the fourth round of the U.S. Open last year, is winning raves from fellow players for the creative, tennis-themed videos she has been posting on TikTok and Instagram. Whether lip-syncing to famous songs, projecting herself into the umpire’s chair while scolding a rowdy crowd at a match, dressing in Wimbledon whites to hit in the backyard of her parents’ New Jersey home or lovingly inhaling the scent of a freshly opened can of tennis balls, Ahn has kept herself and her fans laughing.

“I always used to walk around with a camera on me, so I was always recording and putting together little videos. So there’s not that much footage of me growing up. It’s mostly of my friends, and I’ve got tons of blackmail on them,” she said jokingly during a recent phone conversation. “This is probably one of the first real times that I’ve put myself in front of the camera, and people are seeing that. I’m just really happy that people find it entertaining.”

Beyond providing a few minutes’ amusement, her videos have become a useful tool in getting people through these strange days.

Ahn has become concerned about the mental well-being of players who are experiencing anxiety or losing motivation since their normal life and livelihood were taken away from them, and she’s trying to help. Using her position on the Women’s Tennis Assn.'s Players’ Council, Ahn has been urging the WTA to remind players that the tour — which has suspended events through July 13 — offers mental health resources to guide them through this unprecedented time.

A laugh or attentive conversation can pierce their isolation and lift their spirits, Ahn believes, and she’s leading by example.

“I think everyone is trying to help each other as best they can in whatever capacity, whether that’s posting videos or reaching out to players individually,” she said. “I saw the morale at Indian Wells the day after the cancellation. There were still players going out and practicing. There were players doing fitness on the field but it was the weirdest atmosphere because everyone realized that Miami [the next tournament] was on hinges. We realized this could be the turning point, and all of a sudden the question is, ‘What am I doing this for? Why am I practicing? Why am I training?’ Now we’re in May and that question still applies.

“What’s so tough about the quarantine is not only the physical restrictions of staying inside or keeping your walks to a minimum, but also the mental toll that it takes because of the uncertainty. There’s no guarantee. We’re planning to come back in July. There’s no guarantee that’s going to happen. Originally we were supposed to come back in May. That got pushed to June, which is now July, and at some point I think the morale really takes a hit.

“It’s important to just try to take care of players at this time because we’ve just never been here before. Everyone’s got to band together and help everyone.”

Ahn rose to a career-best ranking of No. 87 last September, when she reached the round of 16 at the U.S. Open for the first time in her career, and she was 96th in the world when competition was put on hold. She was hoping 2020 would be a breakout year. Instead, like everyone else, she’s in limbo.

“It’s very frustrating for me because being top 100, you get that extra perk of getting into main draw Slams on your own. I got a wild card into Indian Wells main draw for the first time, which obviously is one of the best tournaments of the year from everyone’s perspective,” said Ahn, who will be 28 in June. “I played the $125,000 tournament the week before and I felt I had some momentum going into Indian Wells, so I was super-excited to play, then all of a sudden everyone is just on a full stop.

“I guess I’m fortunate — or unfortunate, however you want to look at it — to be very busy in these meetings with the WTA.”

Dampeners: Here for a good time, not a long time pic.twitter.com/jRCBFVtP5z — Kristie Ahn (@kristieahn) April 20, 2020

Those meetings got a happy jolt recently when 20-time Grand Slam singles champion Roger Federer tweeted this would be a good time for the separate men’s and women’s tours to unite as one organization. The women have long advocated that but the ATP men’s tour has resisted.

“That pretty much struck the whole of tennis Twitter. We were very excited to see that because all of a sudden that puts some validation on it,” Ahn said. “It’s public. One of the top players, Roger Federer tweeted about it. That must mean something.

“It’s out there now. This is the time to do it. We have the time. We can use it to our advantage and the tours can hopefully go in the same direction and we can see a better product come out of it in the end.”

Playing a part in making that happen would enhance Ahn’s already impressive resume. She’s near the end of her tennis career, she said, though she’s not sure what’s next. The sport would be fortunate if she takes on an administrative role.

With a new deal to televise Korean league games, ESPN trumpeted the return of baseball, the anchor of the preceding “SportsCenter” program introducing the opening day contest between the Samsung Lions and the NC Dinos by declaring, “Live sports is back.”

Well, almost.

Rain was falling in the city of Daegu, the resulting delay prompting an interview with former Korean Baseball Organization MVP and current major leaguer Eric Thames to be clumsily stretched to nearly 20 minutes.

The game, in which the Dinos prevailed 4-0, didn’t represent a step toward normalcy as much as it did the desperation that has swept over the United States.

Originally scheduled to start at 1 a.m. on the East Coast, the game could have cured the most severe case of insomnia. Talk about a non-habit-forming sleep aid.

The absence of a crowd didn’t help. More critical was how the American audience knew nearly nothing about the contestants. Combat sports can overcome such a lack of familiarity. The possibility that a fellow human being could be injured or killed can be enough to convince a neutral observer to become emotionally engaged. Baseball doesn’t have that luxury. Remove the reservoir of thoughts and feeling developed over multiple generations and what remains is a slow-paced game in which spectators have no rooting interests or story lines to follow.

This was entirely expected, but, as the cliché goes, desperate times call for desperate measures.

Desperate for viewers when the country is shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak, ESPN gambled that enough sports fans are desperate for live competition that they will drastically change their sleep schedules and form a niche audience. Three of the six games that will be televised every week start at 2:30 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time.

The network’s ongoing documentary series on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls has feasted on this hunger. The shows include previously unseen footage but otherwise don’t break ground. The series has nonetheless received fawning reviews from journalists, who sound as if they are auditioning for roles as ESPN publicists.

If the sports industrial complex has a vested interest in making “The Last Dance” appear as if it’s a transcendent event, their customers do too. It helps them maintain sanity in a period of extreme uncertainty. The collective anxiety is based in the very nature of the virus, as well as apprehension over the reliability of information. There are varying opinions over how to best navigate this pandemic. Some are politically based, but some aren’t.

Major League Baseball couldn’t properly handle a sign-stealing scandal. What makes anyone think Commissioner Rob Manfred can navigate a season around a global pandemic?

Maybe some of the speculative stories about baseball returning are based in reality. Maybe spring training can start next month and the season a month after that. Whatever the case, skepticism over motives and a convoluted informational landscape promise to make the road particularly complicated. Opening day feels distant.

The second-ranked Spaniard, who is 33 years old and has won 19 Grand Slam titles, said he hoped to resume playing this year but doubted it could happen because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“I would sign up right now just to being ready for 2021,” Nadal said in interviews with El Pais and other Spanish newspapers published Tuesday. “I’m more concerned with the Australian Open than with what happens later this year. I think 2020 has been practically lost. I’m hopeful of being able to start next year.”

Nadal said the logistical difficulties of having to move people from country to country for tournaments make it hard for tennis to resume safely amid the pandemic.

“Sadly, I’m not going to lie to you, the feeling is that we are losing a year of our lives,” Nadal said. “And at 33, 34 years old, that is more valuable than at 20, when you have more time ahead of you.”

Nadal recently said he was concerned with the risk of new injuries when players return to action after a long time without proper training. The Spaniard has had to deal with a series of injuries throughout his career and expects his body to struggle again when competitions finally resume.

Nadal also complained about “confusing” information regarding the return to practice of tennis players in Spain. He said he went to train on a private court because it wasn’t clear to him whether he could practice normally after the government eased some of the lockdown measures that have been in place in the country since mid-March.

Professional and high-performance athletes have been allowed to resume practicing at any time this week, but sports facilities and training centers are to remain closed, with some exceptions for soccer clubs and a few other sports.

“There were no questions that he sidestepped today,” Burr said. “He answered everything and I think he did a very successful job at, one, verifying that he’s more than capable of this job, and two, will serve in an independent capacity.”

Democrats did not share that assessment about Ratcliffe, who drew national attention as an outspoken defender of Trump during the Russia investigation and impeachment proceedings.

“I don’t see what has changed since last summer when the president decided not to proceed with your nomination over concerns about your inexperience, partisanship and past statements that seemed to embellish your record,” said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the panel’s vice chair.

Warner suggested that his Republican colleagues were advancing Ratcliffe’s nomination only because they are eager to replace Richard Grenell, a fierce Trump partisan who has been acting DNI while still serving as U.S. ambassador to Germany. Warner told Ratcliffe that some senators believe his “main qualification for this post is you are not Ambassador Grenell.”

In his testimony, Ratcliffe pledged to remain independent and to share unwelcome assessments with Trump, who forced out the previous national intelligence director, Dan Coats, after a series of clashes.

“I will deliver the unvarnished truth,” Ratcliffe said. “It won’t be shaded for anyone.”

But he labored to avoid contradicting Trump at the hearing. Only after three senators pressed him did Ratcliffe say he disagreed with the president’s claim that U.S. intelligence agencies — which he would oversee if confirmed — had “run amok.”

Ratcliffe said he couldn’t yet assess other high-profile threats and disputes that would fall under his purview.

He wouldn’t say wheter Iran had complied with the 2015 nuclear disarmament deal, which Trump abandoned, although U.S. agencies and United Nations monitors concluded that it had.

Nor would Ratcliffe say whether North Korea had made any progress toward giving up its nuclear weapons, the goal of Trump’s diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang. U.S. agencies say the country continues to expand its nuclear capability, although it has suspended underground tests.

Ratcliffe dodged when asked if Russia sought to help Trump win the 2016 election, as U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed and the president has adamantly denied.

Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee cast doubt on that assessment, which was released in the closing days of President Obama’s administration, while the Senate Intelligence Committee supported the conclusion in a recent bipartisan report.

“I respect both committees,” Ratcliffe said.

Ratcliffe said he agreed that the Kremlin had meddled in the U.S. election, something Trump has sometimes questioned.

“They have a goal of sowing discord and they have been successful in sowing discord,” he said.

The hearing showed how the coronavirus crisis has reshaped Washington. Senators were asked to watch from their offices and only come to the committee room to directly question Ratcliffe, who sat on the opposite side of the room.

Several senators wore masks, lowering them to ask questions during the hearing. Ratcliffe did not wear a mask.

Burr said the next DNI faced special challenges protecting national security during the pandemic.

“Countries around the world have locked down,” he said. “But those threats have not stopped.”

The White House has asked intelligence agencies to help determine whether the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory, a claim that could escalate fraught tensions between Washington and Beijing.

Trump recently said he’s seen evidence supporting the theory, but neither he nor national security officials have revealed any evidence. U.S. scientists have largely discounted that claim.

Ratcliffe said only that he would continue to examine the issue if confirmed.

“The intelligence community will be laser focused on getting all of the answers that we can regarding how this happened,” he said.

An Illinois native, Ratcliffe served eight years as mayor of Heath, Texas, a small town east of Dallas. In 2007, President George W. Bush named him acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Texas, a post he held for a year before returning to private practice.

Ratcliffe was elected to Congress in 2014 and joined the House Intelligence Committee in 2019. After Trump sought to name Ratcliffe as spy chief last summer, news reports highlighted discrepancies in his resume.

His campaign website said that, as a federal prosecutor he “personally managed dozens of international and domestic terrorism investigations involving some of the nation’s most sensitive security matters” and “put terrorists in prison.”

Records did not support those claims, but neither Republicans nor Democrats questioned him about them Tuesday.",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-05-05/trump-spy-chief-senate-confirmation-hearing
"['Sacramento Bureau Chief', 'John Myers Joined The Los Angeles Times As Sacramento Bureau Chief In', 'Has Spent More Than Two Decades Covering California Politics', 'State Government']",2020-05-04  ,Newsom administration refuses to divulge nearly $1-billion contract for coronavirus masks,"Attorneys for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration refused Monday to reveal the contents of a $990-million contract for purchasing protective masks from a Chinese electric car manufacturer, even though millions of the masks have already arrived in California to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a letter responding to a public records request from the Los Angeles Times, the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services insisted the contract with BYD does not have to be made public, despite similar requests made by members of the Legislature since Newsom announced the deal last month.

“Cal OES determined all responsive records are exempt from disclosure, including exemptions for records reflecting attorney work product, attorney-client privileged information, or other information exempt from disclosure under federal or state law,” Ryan Gronsky, an attorney with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, wrote in a letter to The Times.

Newsom first touted the deal for the company to sell the state a combination of N95 protective masks and more traditional surgical masks during an April 7 appearance on MSNBC.

“We decided enough’s enough,” the governor said to host Rachel Maddow of the state’s need to ensure protective masks could be acquired for emergency responders. “Let’s use the power, the purchasing power of the state of California, as a nation-state.”

A Cal OES spokesman said the agreement calls for the purchase of 200 million masks a month — including 150 million of the N95 variety — and would be in effect for at least two months. But all other details, including the price paid per mask, have been kept confidential.

The Times asked for all documents related to the BYD contract the day after Newsom’s TV appearance. Lawmakers have also requested additional details. Under provisions of emergency legislation ratified in March before the Legislature suspended operations due to the public health crisis, advisors to Newsom were required to give 72 hours notice before authorizing spending on coronavirus-related items. But for the contract with BYD to obtain masks, the administration said action had to be taken even faster.

“Under normal circumstances, the Legislature would have had more time to deliberate an expenditure of this magnitude and would have been allowed to thoroughly vet the details of the contract before proceeding,” state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles) wrote in an April 9 letter to Newsom’s budget director.

In the weeks since, legislators have frequently asked why they’ve been denied access to the contract. Administration officials have insisted disclosure could jeopardize the delivery of the masks, a concern repeated in Monday’s letter to The Times.

“Publishing the agreement now — before performance under the contract is complete — would introduce substantial and unnecessary risk to the State’s ability to secure necessary supplies,” Gronsky wrote.

The first installment of masks arrived last weekend in Los Angeles. A spokesman for Cal OES said Monday that more than 10 million surgical masks have now been delivered. The N95 masks, he said, still are awaiting safety approval by federal officials.

BYD announced in March that it was retooling its Shenzhen vehicle facility to produce masks and hand sanitizer. The company has a U.S. subsidiary headquartered in Los Angeles County, whose executives were touted by state officials as integral to the deal. To date, the state has paid a BYD-affiliated company almost $600 million.

Asked on April 18 about his administration’s refusal to disclose the document, Newsom said he looked forward to “all those details becoming public very, very shortly.” Repeating a promise that the BYD deal could also produce enough protective masks for other states, the governor dismissed concerns about the lack of transparency.

“Some are consumed by process, personality, intrigue, who’s up, who’s down?” Newsom said. “We are for actually solving a major, major problem. Not only for the state, but potentially a template for the country.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-04/gavin-newsom-will-not-release-california-coronavirus-masks-byd-contract

Seven weeks after public health concerns brought the work of the Legislature to a sudden halt, only members of the Assembly are returning to Sacramento this week, with the Senate choosing to do so on May 11. And even then, neither house is planning to reconvene for final votes on bills until June — in large part because of the challenges for adequate physical distancing posed by the tightly placed desks for legislators in the chambers of the Senate and Assembly.

“I know it’s going to be a very different way of doing business. But I think it was important for us to be here, to start thinking about the great challenges that we have ahead,” Assemblywoman Blanca Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) said during the day’s first event, an Assembly hearing on healthcare issues.

Access to the historic statehouse remained limited. Those who were not legislators or staff members had their temperatures checked at the building’s entrance. Elevators were limited to a single occupant — an easy rule to follow on Monday, given the Capitol’s emptiness, but impossible during most springtime workdays, when dozens of hearings and events are usually scheduled.

“The work of the Legislature is essential for democracy, but preserving people’s health as we do that is of the highest importance,” Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) said in a statement. “We have spent the past six weeks developing a way to continue government with maximum safety.”

Assembly members were advised by Dr. Peter Beilenson, director of Sacramento’s County Department of Health Services, to be screened for the novel coronavirus before returning Monday.

“To protect both the legislators when they gather and the public who will be attending, I recommended that they get tested,” he said in an interview.

Because asymptomatic people can still transmit the virus, Beilenson said, all lawmakers and staff should contact their private physicians to arrange coronavirus tests, even if they are not showing symptoms.

“Anyone testing positive should isolate themselves at home for 14 days,” Beilenson wrote in a memo to the Assembly. “Of course, any legislator or staff that falls in the high-risk groups (65-plus and/or chronic underlying health conditions) should follow the guidance of their healthcare provider in terms of their decision about whether or not they should attend the session.”

Some lawmakers, including Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), have balked at getting a test when many other members of the public, including healthcare workers, have not yet been checked for the virus. Gonzalez said she asked for a clear directive from Beilenson’s office that she could give to her doctor, but she has not received one.

“As such, I do not meet our county’s criteria for testing and will not ask to be pushed to the front of the line,” Gonzalez said. “If I am required to get tested in Sacramento, exhibit any symptoms or am exposed to a COVID-19-positive individual, I will do so.”

Age is one risk factor among the 120 members of the Legislature. Thirteen members of the Senate are 65 or older, while 10 in that age group serve in the Assembly.

California had more than 55,000 confirmed cases and more than 2,200 deaths tied to the virus as of Monday afternoon, according to data collected by The Times. A spokesman for Rendon said his office has not heard of any Assembly member testing positive for COVID-19.

Six Assembly members asked for, and were granted, an excused absence from traveling to Sacramento due to age or underlying health conditions. One of them, Assemblyman Bill Quirk (D-Hayward), sent a letter to Rendon asking for consideration to vote remotely on bills.

“We see individuals, despite taking the best of precautions, getting infected,” Quirk said on Friday. “This is concerning.”

But legislative lawyers think a 2016 constitutional amendment, approved by voters, makes that untenable. Article IV, Section 7 of the California Constitution says that “the proceedings of each house and the committees thereof shall be open and public,” written as part of Proposition 54’s mandate that bills be available for public review for 72 hours before a final vote. The concern is that lawmakers voting remotely won’t meet the standard for public access to their actions.

Assemblyman Kevin Mullin (D-San Mateo), who serves as speaker pro tem, says he’s working on a constitutional amendment to help clarify the rules in hopes that it provides governing options in times like these and during natural disasters. The change would have to be approved by voters this November.

How much the Legislature can accomplish this year is limited by the calendar. Almost all of the Assembly’s policy committees will meet only one more time this year to consider bills authored by its members. Only 14 bills were on the agenda for Monday’s meeting of the Assembly Transportation Committee, even though legislative records show 84 bills were sent to the committee — meaning most of them will be held without further action.

The transportation panel offered one of the more unusual moments on Monday, its 15 members and assorted staff convening in the cavernous Assembly chamber, where they could safely spread out.

Two legislators wore gloves. One of them, Assemblyman Mike Gipson (D-Carson), sported a black protective mask with the phrase “California Safe” written in white letters.

“What a historic moment,” said Assemblywoman Luz Rivas (D-North Hollywood) as she stood behind a stanchion to present her bill, Assembly Bill 3213, which seeks to force new project priorities for the California High-Speed Rail Authority.

Yet when the city issued an emergency proclamation Friday that required citizens to wear face coverings, store employees were “threatened with physical violence and showered with verbal abuse,” according to a statement released by the city. In response, Stillwater quickly amended its wording to only “encourage” use of masks.

“This has occurred in three short hours and in the face of clear medical evidence that face coverings help contain the spread of COVID-19,” Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said in a statement. “Many of those with objections cite the mistaken belief the requirement is unconstitutional, and under their theory, one cannot be forced to wear a mask. No law or court supports this view.”

About a dozen states have reopened more of their economies since Friday’s calendar turn to May, with several, including Florida, loosening more restrictions Monday. No matter where a state falls on the reopening spectrum, though, all Americans who choose to go outside are being met with a choice that isn’t going away anytime soon: to cover up or not?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says “everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public” to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. The federal agency notes that masks are to protect others and that they are not a substitute for social distancing.

In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine backtracked last week on an order to require masks be worn in stores as too many Ohioans found it “offensive.”

“It became clear to me that was just a bridge too far. People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do,” DeWine said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

On Monday, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, as part of a tour acknowledging the reopening of most of the state, visited a thrift store in Joplin that is operated by the Disabled American Veterans. The veteran workers wore masks, but Parson did not.

“I chose not to,” Parson said, when asked at his news briefing why he did not cover his face.

“I think it’s up to the individuals. I don’t think that’s government’s role to mandate who wears a mask and who don’t. I go back to what I’ve said all along: It’s your personal responsibility.”

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis allowed the reopening of most restaurants, retailers, museums and libraries at 25% capacity Monday. DeSantis — who controversially referred to his state, with its large population of older residents, as “God’s waiting room” last week — is recommending that employees and customers wear masks, but he is not requiring it.

DeSantis’ phased opening plan kept populous South Florida counties Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach closed for most business.

Miami reopened parks to the public last week, but only with the mandatory use of masks. By the end of the weekend, park rangers had handed out more than 7,000 warnings to people not wearing face covers, most of them in the popular South Pointe Park, police said. On Monday, the city closed up the park at the end of South Beach yet again.

New Jersey opened its parks Saturday, and although Gov. Phil Murphy was pleased overall with the social distancing compliance shown by the population, he shared one major complaint Monday.

“Not enough masks,” he said. Eighty percent to 90% “of the folks were not wearing masks.”

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a mandatory mask order April 15 and said Monday that he believes local governments should have the right to enforce it.

“Because you could literally kill someone,” Cuomo said. “How cruel and irresponsible would that be? … It’s not that big of a deal. You don’t wear a mask to protect yourself. You wear a mask to protect me. And I wear a mask to protect you.

“No one said wear a mask all the time. If you go for a walk in the woods, you don’t have to wear a mask. You can have the mask down when walking in the woods, but if you see someone coming the other way, you put the mask on. It’s the least we can do.”

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 surpassed 68,600 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than a third of American losses from the disease were in the state of New York, which has become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more than 24,900 deaths as of Monday afternoon. The global death total has surpassed 250,000.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio began his Monday morning news briefing by talking about how nice the weather had been in the city over the weekend — and how that could lead to a false sense of normality. New York City on Monday reported 13,536 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 and 5,373 deaths in which the cause was listed as the disease but the victim was not tested.

De Blasio said he did not have a problem with citizens returning to outside spaces and enjoying the weather as long as they wore a mask and kept social distancing requirements. He announced Monday that the city would be distributing 5 million three-ply nonmedical masks and 2.5 million cloth face coverings for free in the coming weeks.

“Wherever you turn, you’re going to be offered a face covering,” De Blasio said.

De Blasio and New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea were peppered with questions stemming from a video of an officer pointing a Taser at bystanders in lower Manhattan during an arrest of people accused of not social distancing properly. The video shows the officer punching and slapping a man as he brings him to the ground.

“This one incident is troubling, but there’s been tens of thousands of interactions between police officer and civilians that went very well,” De Blasio said. The officer has been placed on modified duty and the incident is being investigated, De Blasio said Sunday.

On Monday he said more face covers could help prevent future violent scenarios from playing out with enforcement, but in this case, the plainclothes officer was also not wearing a mask.

In Oklahoma, Stillwater City Manager McNickle said in a statement that one of the incidents involving the mask requirement included a threat with a firearm.

In Michigan, where Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered that masks be worn through May, state police investigators are looking into reports that a Flint dollar store security guard was fatally shot Friday after an argument with a customer who had refused to wear a mask in the store, according to the Detroit News.

The man who died leaves behind a wife and eight kids.

“My condolences go out to the family of the security guard,” Whitmer said Monday. “It is incredible that people continue to show up to work to protect everyone else. We are mindful of how important it is that people keep a level head, that we do the right things. I ask that all Michiganders keep their wits about them and take actions to protect themselves and others in this incredibly stressful time.”",latimes,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-04/coronavirus-masks-states-reopening
